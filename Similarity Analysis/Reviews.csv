0,MonDak_Joe1953,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,4.71,"Tap pour at the taproom. Served chilled in a small snifter glass.
Black colored body. No lasting head. No lacing, but leaves a sheen.
Aroma of dark roasted malt, bourbon barrel, maple syrup, caramel, toffee, and a bit of dark fruit/cherry.
Taste is sweet from the maple syrup and bourbon barrel, also vanilla. Flavors of fudge chocolate, caramel, toffee, and dark fruit - cherry and figs. Long lasting aftertaste with chocolate, bourbon, and toffee.
Thicker mouthfeel with syrup. Higher ABV% only detected in the vapors. Quiet carbonation.
Rich and decadent dessert beer. Treat of the day, and from the source."
1,Rristow,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,5,"The perfect barrel aged stout. Not overly sweet, nice barrel notes with coffee and maple. Just delish!"
2,BEERchitect,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,4.8,"The flirtation with maple comes to a crescendo in Toppling Goliath's imperial maple, coffee and bourbon barrel aged stout.

Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout shows that something special is up when it pours with an inky impression of black brandy equipped with sticky legging swirling around an ominously still beer. As a sultry, savory and oh-so seductive scent pulls from the onyx-black beer, the mouth waters with the scent of espresso, dark chocolate, maple, sweet bourbon and port wine. Expectedly sweet, the toasty malts bring out the flavor of maple-dipped chocolate, chocolate covered espresso bean, bourbon ball candies and whisky laced molasses.

Bold, savory, sweet and mouth coating on the middle palate, the boldness of the stout remains in check while the more roasty edges pull from the sweetness with espresso roast, toasty, smoky and baker's chocolate that all trend spicy, lightly bitter and balancing with a chest warming offset of bourbon and all of its caramel, vanilla, toasted oak and peppery whisky flavors in closure.

Obviously full, rich and lavishly malted from start to finish, the stout finishes on a drying track in an off-pastry mouthfeel of spice, light bitterness and port-like warmth. It's a masterful stout that belongs on such lofty pedestals."
3,cdinardo21,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,4.98,"On tap at TG for part of KBBS release day - rating 2023 version; perfect black color. This is an amazing blend richness, dessert and coffee; the barrel is perfectly complimentary and not overpowering. The sweetness is palatable rather than making your teeth hurt. The mouthfeel is thick and silky. Overall, one of the best beers I've had."
4,GreenBayBA,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,4.7,"Perfect black color. I didn't see much foam, other than a brown ring. The smell is a perfect blend of maple, coffee, chocolate, and bourbon. The taste is strong with maple. Almost too strong. Chocolate follows, with coffee, bourbon, and vanilla. It is very sweet. The mouthfeel is thick, smooth, lucious, and full. Very nice. Overall, this is a wonderful beer, but there is too much maple flavor for it to be one of my favorite beers."
5,poidog,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,5,"Amazing stout, expensive but worth the price!"
6,Filabee,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,5,This beer meet and exceeded all the unreal hype. It is simply amazing!
7,edthehead,Vanilla Bean Assassin,4.74,"Black thick appearance with no head, barely even a collar, no lacing. Whiskey barrel mellowed nicely by vanilla a la marshmallows, milk chocolate, and latte. Moderate to thick body, light carbonation. Delicious!"

How does one follow up review #1000 with the #1 highest rated beer on BA? Review #200 being the #2 highest rated beer of course! I’m very excited for another massive milestone review beer, and I couldn’t think of a better way to celebrate it than with this legendary beer. Let’s pop this bad boy open and find out what it’s all about

Pours completely pitch black with a finger of frothy light tan head that quickly fades to a thin ring and leaves minimal lacing

There’s just a massive punch of vanilla in the nose, and while there’s also a nice fruitiness it’s not all that complex. I’m picking up on aromas of vanilla bean, red grape, milk chocolate, toasted oak, jammy blackberry, molasses, sweet bourbon, burnt caramel, and brown sugar

It’s has more of an evolution to it in taste, and it is so damn tasty. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting chocolate fudge, sweet bourbon, vanilla bean, jammy blackberry, raisin, toasted oak, fruity coffee, burnt caramel, molasses, and light walnut. The swallow brings notes of vanilla extract, red grape, brown sugar, charred oak, sweet bourbon, molasses, jammy blackberry, burnt caramel, chocolate fudge, light fig, and marshmallow

A medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a slick beer. Finishes a tad sticky but it doesn’t hurt the drinkability

This beer is absolutely worthy of this milestone review. The aroma had me a bit concerned it would be simplistic despite it being good, but it’s so much more than just vanilla. Great stuff!"
10,Bhubbard34,Vanilla Bean Assassin,5,"12oz bottle…2022 version. Drank 12/25/22.
Pours dark brown/black, not much carbonation. Smells of sweet chocolate, vanilla, and barrel. Taste is marshmallows soaked in bourbon. Perfect sweetness. If there is a knock it’s slightly on the thin side, but that’s being picky. Probably the best adjunct stout I’ve had. Truly lives up to the hype."
11,edthehead,O.W.K.,5,"Batch 2. This stout certainly lives up to its reputation. Black, oily, faint carbonation, thick mouthfeel, big big but balanced and pleasant vanilla and barrel on the nose and palate. GOAT stout caliber."
12,StoutSnob40,O.W.K.,4.68,"Pours oily black that sits in the glass like road tar. No notable head, but syrupy legs stream down that glass as it’s swirled in a futile attempt to generate one. This looks evil.

For the amount of vanilla in this beer, it doesn’t overpower the nose. It’s definitely there, but the barrel and dark chocolate malt balance things out. It’s crème brûlée with boozy dark chocolate ganache on top.. if that’s a thing.. If anything, I was looking for more barrel in the aroma to help invite you into the glass.

God damn, this is good. It’s vanilla-heavy and playful, but still oaky and austere. Tons of dark chocolate fudge, spicy rye, waffle cone, maillard, soaked charred oak and earthy cacao. I’ve found Side Project’s extended-aged stouts have been far more dry and oaky lately. It’s a good evolution for them."
13,cdinardo21,O.W.K.,4.99,"Probably a top 5 beer I've had. Consumed from a bottle pour at the SP 10th anniversary. Blend #2 (2023). Pitch black pour - amazing viscosity. Perfect blend of bourbon and vanilla. Starts off with bourbon forward followed quickly by the perfect vanilla punch. Don't really have much in the way of notes on this one. It's a world class stout and somehow, despite expectations behing high, this still managed to exceed them."
14,BeerRay,O.W.K.,5,2023
15,RichD,Marshmallow Handjee,5,OMG!! One of the finest elixirs I’ve ever tasted. The 15% is non existent. The vanilla is in your face. The base beer is phenomenal. Truly a transcendent experience. Wow!!

17,Rug,Marshmallow Handjee,4.6,"2022 vintage, bottle 1316/3500

Another milestone review, number 1800! I figured since I have the highest rated RIS on BA just sitting around that it would be a perfect time to break it out. This is my first of any Dark Lord variant, and I think it’s a damn good place to start for the series. Let’s pop this legend open and see what it has to offer

Pours almost completely pitch black with a finger of creamy tan head that fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing

The roast is real in this one, but it’s wonderfully offset by the sweeter notes as well. I’m picking up on aromas of drip coffee, burnt caramel, dark toast, milk chocolate, tobacco, vanilla bean, molasses, toasted oak, fig, and light cinnamon

It’s similar in taste, but with even more of a depth, making this one hell of a complex beer. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting milk chocolate, vanilla bean, sweetened coffee, toasted oak, fig, maple syrup, burnt caramel, sweet bourbon, cinnamon, black cherry, and marshmallow. The swallow brings notes of milk chocolate, charred oak, maple syrup, burnt caramel, black cherry, fig, vanilla bean, allspice, sweet bourbon, marshmallow, dark toast, and tobacco

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a smooth beer. Finishes mostly dry with just a touch of boozy heat

Oh yeah, this is amazing. Thankfully a beer that lives up to the hype. Maybe one day I’ll splurge on another bottle"
18,zonker17,Marshmallow Handjee,4.86,"2019 bottle, purple sparkle wax. Pours black with minimal head, no retention. Nose rich vanilla, fruity with strawberry, graham cracker. Taste boozy, chocolate, toasted marshmallow. Full body and minimal carbonation."
19,SayBoom,Marshmallow Handjee,4.42,2022 v.
20,ajramirez1,Marshmallow Handjee,5,"Had the yellow wax at a wedding dinner party. Vanilla/marsh overload, barrel was there, but mostly sweet. Pretty good"
21,LifesAnesthesia,Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,4.81,"L - Deep brown, nearly pitch black with a small tan head that dissipates nearly immediately, leaving behind no real lacking 
S - rich chocolate and chilis up front followed by caramel, vanilla, rich bourbon, and toffee
T - follows the nose: rich chocolate and even fudge, caramel, molasses, and toffee intermixed well throughout, followed by notes of vanilla, roasted malts, warm chilis, and cinnamon.
F - full bodied with light carbonation. Incredibly smooth and soft. Silky. 
O - easily one of the best barrel aged stouts I've ever had"
22,SpeedwayJim,Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,4.29,"750ml waxed and capped bottle into a DDG teku.

Pours thick, viscous. No head, no lace. Big, mocha colored legs. Spice and cinnamon sugar are apparent on the nose. Also notes of chocolate, fudge, molasses, and booze. Very pungent. Beer opens chocolate, fudge, and cinnamon sugar. Spicy and prickly. Vanilla and barrel in the middle. Oak, booze, and more molasses and fudge at the end. Sticky finish. Body is full with low carbonation. Smooth and rich on the palate and goes down messy with a lingering aftertaste. 

I'm actually less of a fan of this than other imperial stouts in Perennial's barrel aged series. That being said, still far better than average."
23,NCSapiens,Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,4.4,"Excellent rye barrel with strong taste of cinnamon. Hints of cocoa nibs, ancho, and vanilla are pushed into the background by the barrel flavor, which dominates the other flavors. It is very good, but personally I slightly prefer the greater nuance of the regular Abraxis."
24,DucksFan16,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,4.27,"LONG time want of mine! 2016 vintage. Unfortunately, most of the cocoa, vanilla, and cinnamon has faded already. All that remains is the apple brandy, and strong ancho chilies. Spicy burn on finish. I’m sure it’s a shell of its former self."

28,Bhubbard34,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,3.95,"2016 Vintage - Drank 02/24/21

Smell -pleasant with notes of tobacco and chocolate

Taste - The tobacco over powers this one in the beginning. And then as it warms, the peppers take over. Very unique taste, and I think it’s the brandy barrel influence.

Feel - thin, and I expected more

Overall - for being the #4 overall beer on BA, I expected more, much more. The feel was thin, and notes of pepper overpowered this. Yet it was not completely unenjoyable, just not even close to the 4th best beer in the world. Regardless, glad I gut to try it as it’s always nice to see what the hype is about. This one just didn’t live up to it"
29,ThisWangsChung,Blessed,4.83,"Pours a pitch black color with no head. Only the alcohol legs stand out aesthetically. The aroma, though, might be one of the most multi-faceted yet delicate experiences I've encountered in the beer world. There's just so much going on, yet the notes of bourbon, chocolate, dark fruits, vanilla, coconut, and almonds are so harmonious and perfectly balanced, it just blows my mind. The flavor profile absolutely doesn't disappoint in the slightest, and I gave the aroma a 5! A fuckin' 5! I don't hand out 5's the way Stone Cold Steve Austin hands out Stone Cold Stunners, that's for sure. It opens with a huge hit of coconut and vanilla, revealing a midtaste of dark fruit goodness. Oak gradually appears on the back end, with a perfectly balanced hit of booze to cleanse the palate. Despite the extreme flavors, it's shockingly balanced, though perhaps less delicate than the aroma; that's my only real nit to pick, and I wonder if it's even worth picking. The feel is just a touch flat, but despite the intense, palate coating sweetness, the oak tannins and nuanced alcohol presence do enough to cleanse the palate. In general, it's extreme but somehow well rounded...the best of both worlds.

I don't regret spending $53 on this small bottle. Enough said. This right here - in my humble opinion - is a paragon of the beer world, and the best barrel aged stout I've ever sampled."
30,lucius10,Blessed,4.5,"Sweet milk chocolate, a hint of savory/umami, prominent vanilla, fleshy raw coconut, and a bourbon barrel nose on this one! Great aromatics here! Taste follows with a thick and velvety, milk chocolate-covered coconut, and a big, vanilla-bourbon barrel boozy heat finish. And I mean heat! Whoa! Not sure if it is this particular bottle, but that boozy backend is the only drawback IMO. This is absolutely delicious! I just wish a little more balance was given to the barrel treatment here."
31,MutuelsMark,Blessed,4.88,"WOW, what a beer. Black as ink with a tiny brown head that leaves absolutely no lacing, unless you count the brownish staining from the charred beer. Nose is coffee and charr, but also alcohol. Taste is very chocolatey, then the warmth builds from the alcohol, however not overwhelmingly so. Very smooth beer. Great beer."
32,mschrei,Blessed,4.8,"Part of me wanted to age this for a long time. And then things in my life recently made me feel we should do what we can while we can, so maybe I should drink the hugest ranked beer I have in my collection. 

It’s sweet, flavorful, balanced, and boozy. 

Dark, very brown edging, oil sheen top.

Strong sweet notes of coconut, vanilla, toasted dark malt, and bourbon barrel so strong it can burn your nose hair.

Taste is a duel between strong booze of the bourbon barrel and the sweetness of the coconut and vanilla. 

Feel is the weak point here. It’s maybe too much of a booze burn, and it’s a bit sticky and thick. I’m thinking aging it would have helped, and it’s my fault for that.

But I wanted to try this beer, and I did. Glad I did. It’s big on flavor and booze and very enjoyable for the attempt."
33,Mar02x,Blessed,4.37,Way to sweet for my palate - but I feel very blessed that I had the opportunity to try it
34,mrmsmith,Blessed,4.63,"2021 editiion, drank May 2022. So sweet, even the small bottle was a lot to drink solo. Ten Years was much more balanced."
35,ovaltine,Blessed,4.85,"Pours squid ink black and settles in the glass like a black velvet cloak, stopping all light, sitting under a sudsy dark tan head that dissipates quickly, as expected with a beer of this gravity. Absolutely gorgeous imperial stout.

I don’t know if the nose of a beer can be decadent, but this beer’s nose is, with rich cocoa and vanilla notes up front, some dark cherries, and a sledgehammer of oak and barrel notes.

The taste is led by the vanilla and cocoa notes, and they are rich and chewy, moving into the dark cherry flavors to cut the sweetness a bit, and then finishing with the oak and a welcome boozy warming from the three bourbon barrels featured in this beer.

The mouthfeel is as rich and decadent as a gooey bourbon soaked brownie sitting in a dip of vanilla ice cream. I can’t imagine a more perfect rendering of a BA imperial stout."
36,BEERchitect,Blessed,4.83,"If Woodford Reserve, Willet and Heavenly Hill were to get together and make a beery baby, they would be so blessed to have this stout. Slumbering away for extended aging these three barrels give Anchorage Brewing a love child that can compete with the best.

Jet black and pouring like inky tar, Blessed pours with a luscious, ominous and velvety pour. While shy on froth the overwhelming scent of molasses, chocolate, whisky, oak, coconut and cream align with stronger scents of coffee and campfire. Once on the tongue, the immense sweetness of molasses, brown sugar and fudge carry and nearly brownie-batter taste with those sweeter bourbon barrels playing a maple and coconut sweetness.

As the sweeter flavors swirl on the tastebuds, notions of mound and almond joy pop off of the middle palate while the malts remain juicy and plush. Trailing into a smooth espresso, cappuccino character, the late taste brings out all of those coconut, toasted oak, vanilla, cherry and savory smoke to have the session trending warm, sultry and savory set of pleasantries.

Full bodied, pillowy and fortified with nearly port-like proportions, the stout is simply magical. It pushes the boundaries in what is a fully malted imperial stout before pushing into the pastry realm. The warmth of whisky is soothed with caramel malts, vanilla and coconut and balances the sheer malts with utter ease."
37,ThaKennster,Blessed,5,Top tier.

39,jhavs,Blessed,4.54,"2022 bottle, thick like motor oil, black, sweet, boozy, opaque, chocolate, dark fruits. Minimal carbonation that is appropriate for the style. Smooth barrel."
40,matcris,Heady Topper,4.99,"Lots of mango, peach, melon, apricot, pine, and even mint in the aroma and flavor; smacks you right in the face.

Looks like a well made double IPA; good head retention, lacing.

Nice, full body and full carbonation, nice sweetness on top of the palate with a balanced bitterness on the tongue that builds.

Slightly sticky up front and finishes dry. 

Superb DIPA all around. Love it."
41,Roxchambeau,Heady Topper,4.62,"Wandered into a store while out on an errand and was approached by an employee who offered a case from the back. Score! 

This beer is unlike anything I've had before. It's almost ""pure"" hop flavor. Earthy, natural, no distractions. Light carbonation, smooth mouth feel, no alcohol burn, just HOPS! 

Nice long finish. Glad I finally got to try after hearing so much about these brews."
42,CObrewsbaby,Heady Topper,4.56,"Found this beer yesterday at my local liquor world. It was limited to one pack per person and it was the last one in the store. I sent it because I was so curious. I looked it up and people have a hard time getting their hands on it during the limited time they sell. It’s honestly the best IPA I’ve had, it doesn’t leave the nasty hoppy flavor lingering, it’s crisp and almost fruity. Really cool can in my opinion too, really simple but unique. Lucky find on my part."
43,Jduckart,Heady Topper,5,Like drinking magic.
44,mvanaskie13,Heady Topper,4.37,"Poured into narrow imperial pint glass: color is straw godl, hazy but not dense, head is off white with mixed bubbles, presents 1+ finger thick, solid top remains and lacing on the glass sides. 

Smell is citric, floral, light malt with biscuit and oats/wheat notes. 

Taste is well balanced - aroma is enhanced just before tasting with biscuit/herbal/floral notes, taste is citric rind/pith, floral, herbal notes, then biscuit/oaty note, lighter sweet malt. 

Mouthfeel is low/moderate carbonation, moderate sweetness, moderate bitterness. 

Overall a brew that lives up to its status - hops, light malt, balanced bitterness and sweetness."
45,Mar02x,A Deal With The Devil - Triple Oak-Aged,4.86,"Briljant beer and worth searching for.
In the nose - a really nice and complex smell that longs for another sniff.
Taste- complex, sweet but not overwhelming, caramel, tannins and vanilla from the barrel. 
Overall- excellent flavor and taste, not unbalanced in anyway."
46,maximum12,A Deal With The Devil - Triple Oak-Aged,4.73,"Thank you to noblepudding, a prince among traders, for sending this fancy, gold-waxed bottle to the northern steppes. 375ML, Batch #7. 

The pour is a muddied brown-red with the expected lack of bubbles. The nose is a sharp spike of bourbon & booze. 

A Deal with the Devil – Triple Oaked is a multi-layered beast. The booze is off the charts for a malt-based product & the bourbon exhale is spectacular; if I drank the stuff I suspect I could pull some of the various bottles out of the layers. Underneath that glorious noise is black, bruised, sweet fruit just on the edge of gone, molasses, achingly sweet, before the desiccated oak brings it home. Shame this bottle is so small. I have lots of sick/vacation time to use on three of these in a night. 

Well, damn. Anchorage rarely misses on their big bottles & they better not based on the price point. This is transcendent."
47,dafla67,A Deal With The Devil - Triple Oak-Aged,4.87,"Pours a deep, dark brown color. Aroma is an amazing, complex combination of dark fruits, oak, bourbon with hints of caramel and a tad bit of coconut. Taste follows nose but with more intensity of flavor and sweetness -- the dark fruits (fig and plums), brown sugar, caramel, bourbon and the oak. So very balance and very present in the taste without distracting from the other flavors. Full bodied, traditional ADWTD mouthfeel. Incredible barleywine and worth the wait."
48,mrmsmith,A Deal With The Devil - Triple Oak-Aged,4.6,"2021 batch 3, drank in June 2022. Didn't get as much from this as previous ADWTD. Felt sweet without complexity that you would expect. Still very delicious, just not worth the price."
49,GreatStoutman,A Deal With The Devil - Triple Oak-Aged,5,"Complex and boozy, hits all the right barley wine notes but adds so much more. Fruity, sweet but not cloying. Thick but not too heavy, just all around outstanding."
50,Sabtos,A Deal With The Devil - Triple Oak-Aged,4.35,"My first sacrifice at Dark Lord Day 2023 (it's back baby!!!), this screenprinted batch 1 Triple Oak label--sporting those the Aussie stickers with pride--poured a mildly viscous clear reddish-copper with nary a head to speak of, though ringed by a bubbly tan chain.

Intensely woody up front, it even leans a little pungent and catty right out of the bottle. However, it quickly transforms into an explodingly delectable maple tempered by a whiskey heat that both continue to expand on the exhale and with each subsequent sip.

Though this definitely shows its age, it's quite the experience nevertheless. Still, I'm not sure anything can beat my nostalgia for the original cognac-only bomber, despite my Double Oak rating being the highest of all three."
51,TonyLuvsBeer,M.J.K.,5,Absolute phenomenal brew. Super complex. Perfect in every way. It was the star of our beercation to Side Project.
52,cdinardo21,M.J.K.,4.98,"4 oz bottle pour at the brewery for the 10th Anniversary; finally getting around to acknowledging it. Very barrel-forward, and really gives you everything that you'd want out of a BA barleywine. Pours a deep copper brown with no head as expected, as the 2021 vintage was bottled still; notes of many apple cider, plum, and raisins. 

Light vanilla, leather, light tobacco as it warms. The mouthfeel is very smooth for such a high ABV beverage. Surprisingly there is little to no heat from the 20% alcohol.

Very much looking to try the 2024 vintage at Stout Week this year. Just a world class beer."
53,BeerRay,M.J.K.,5,Unbelievable poor at side projection
54,dontknojack,M.J.K.,5,"This was by far not only the best barleywine I have ever had but for its style, one of the best beers I have ever had. Incredible for its ABV. Perfect complexity and balanced appropriately."
55,SadMachine,M.J.K.,4.99,"2021 vintage bottle pour on site.

A- Pours a deep auburn/ruby brown that has a small amount of transparency. This was bottled still, so there is no head as expected, but it has absolutely gorgeous legs when swirled in the glass!

S- The aroma explodes from the glass, with tremendously expressive notes of many different fruits! Huge notes of mulled apple cider, plum, prune, and red wine soaked raisins. Charred oak, sweet vanilla, leather, light tobacco, and warming booze come through more as it warms. A bright, but not tart, Granny Smith apple note is surprising, but rounds out this extraordinarily complex aroma perfectly!

T- The flavor opens with tobacco and leather, followed by some remarkably smooth charred oak. All of the aforementioned fruit notes follow, with the mulled apple cider and wine soaked raisins as the prominent players. Loads of sweet bourbon and vanilla finish this out beautifully!

F- The mouthfeel is perfectly round, with absolutely no sharp edges despite the 20% abv! It is thick and viscous without being cloying at all. Somehow there is no alcohol heat, even in the finish. Just perfect!

O- This is essentially a perfect beer! I was trying to find flaws, and it's just really hard to do so. An absolute treat to try, and I would seek this out as many times as I can!"
56,Lucular,Mornin' Delight,4.54,"2023 vintage. 7.75 oz pour on tap for $13.50. Pours pitch black with a voluminous tan head. Aroma and flavor feature a TON of maple syrup, along with coffee, dark roasted malts, dark chocolate, vanilla, and bourbon. Sweet but not cloying. Definitely some alcohol heat which would probably become smoother with age. Obviously super glad to have tried this, but didn't quite live up to the hype for me. It's quite tasty but strikes me as a giant maple bomb first and foremost."
57,MutuelsMark,Mornin' Delight,4.82,Pours as dark as it possibly be. Not much head to speak of. He knows has a chard smell to it. The taste is sweet with a caramel and likely maple flavor to it. Nice warm on the throat. Wow is all I can say.
58,DaveMaciolek21,Mornin' Delight,4.99,"Finally had this--one of USA's Holy Grail beers--at Henry's in Saratoga Springs, NY. Believe the hype! Jet black pour with a thin tan creamy head. Maple syrup and espresso nose. This beer glides down the hatch delivering maple sweetness, light chocolate which is then balanced with a slightly bitter coffee tannin finish. It's just flat-out brilliant. Grab one and don't let go."
59,Zekenyce,Mornin' Delight,4.75,Holy Maple!!!
60,Smakawhat,King Julius,4.45,"Poured from the can into an elongated tulip glass. Return of the king 11/24/2023.

Two finger sized tall, white capped and looking slightly creamy. Speckled lacing with simple staying power. Marmalade solid orange colored body with just the faintest amount of carbonation. Does have a turbid appearance.

Ripping tangerine aroma and cream on the nose. Light touches of oily citrus zest, but also a good vanilla like cream sweetness that lingers in the background. Mild touches of herbal hop and mint as well. Excellent hop profile. 

Wonderful palate to match. Tangerine bursting and chewy orange rind on first sip. Slight flour dry malt base which turns into a more supportive feature than flavoring accents. Creamed only slightly with still light vanilla touches on the finish and no surprises from the nose. Herbal spice of pine and mint round out.

Solid big no surprises here just exceptional flavor in a great package."
61,Hobbs87,King Julius,4.73,"Just a phenomenal brew. Top notch DIPA. Great color with a citrus aroma but not overwhelming. Fantastic flavor, smooth and juicy with very little bitterness. I would highly recommend."
62,Darkmagus82,King Julius,4.44,"Poured from a can into a teku glass
Appearance – The beer pours a super hazy orange juice color with a thick puffy head of just off-white foam. The head has an incredible level of retention, very slowly fading over time and leaving a massive amount of foamy and streaky lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – A gigantic amount of tangerine and orange greet the nose, along with big aromas of tropical fruits of pineapple and papaya. Other big hop smells of grapefruit and herb are there as well, mixed with a big showing of a very raw and green hop smell, pungent like a raw hop nugget. Notes of yeast and a bit of lemon mix in there as well, and with a bready and slightly doughy malt smell, a very fruity and inviting aroma is produced overall.
Taste – The taste begins much drier than one would anticipate from the nose. It starts with a moderately bready flavor mixed with lots of tangerine and grapefruit as well as a big showing of orange and mango. Right from the start the hop is ever present with a good showing of a smooth grapefruit hop mixed with lots of raw herbal and earthy hop flavors. The hop is fresh tasting, almost like biting into a hop nugget, melding well with the other flavors nicely. Toward the end, there is a touch of hay and grass, as well as a bit of lemon and an increase in the tropical fruits with a bit of pineapple joining in. The flavor transitions that transpire lead to a nice somewhat more raw and dankly hopped, but smooth taste to linger on the tongue.

Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is rather thick and chewy with a carbonation level that is slightly more subdued. For the rich hop flavors the feel is fantastic making for a nice easy slow and flavorful sipper.
Overall – A well renowned beer for a reason. It is damn good. While not the number 1 IPA for me, it was very flavorful, hoppy, smooth, and balanced; a blend that is difficult to attain. Well done."
63,GregDBoston,King JJJuliusss,4.93,Almost the perfect NEIPA. Rich and velvety with tons of terps. Much meatier and not as sweet as some Tree Houses. Now for just a little lower ABV . . .
64,TCgenny,King JJJuliusss,4,"Poured bright and bouncy from can that travelled many miles from Charleton via Connecticut via my buddy The Woodchipper, canned 1/9/24. Golden yellow apprearance with a rich head dissipating down to a soap lace on the tulip glass. Great bitter grapefruit mango tropical melange flavor. I imagine the aroma/ flavor would be even more bursting had the can been fresher/ less miles on it, but I am grateful."
65,Jw13,King JJJuliusss,4.69,Deep yellow-orange pour with small head that leaves plenty of lace on the glass. Smells of orange and mango with a touch of grass.

Look - No head and little carb, gold color. 
Smell - Distinctly lambic.
Taste - Acid. Too much at cellar temp, but when it got to room temp, it was more tasty, but still too much on the sour side for my taste. 
Feel - Medium mouthfeel with low carbonation. 
Overall - Just too sour and acidly of a lambic for me to really enjoy; I need to give another blend another shot just to see if it was this batch, or if Zenne might not be my thing."
68,flagmantho,Pliny The Younger,4.15,"I had this beer on-tap in a tulip glass at Special Brews in Lynnwood, WA. 

Appearance: medium-light golden hue with just the tiniest wisp of haze and practically no head.

Smell: a light, sweet, almost tropical fruitiness with some piney hop character atop a pretty pronounced malt aroma. Nice.

Taste: richly malty and a bit sweet, but with lots of bitterness backing it up. There’s a little fruity character here, I’m thinking from fermentation, along with some piney/grassy notes from the hops. It’s interesting — a rich flavorful beer, but neither as cloying nor as harsh as TIPAs often are. Worth the hype? Maybe. But certainly a good beer.

Mouthfeel: medium body with a good level of carbonation and creaminess.

Overall: I like this beer a lot, and I bet if I’d tried it 15 years ago it would have blown my mind (and my palate). In today’s IPA climate, competition is tough and we as consumers are spoiled. That said, this remains a really tasty beer."
69,Hayesbro,Pliny The Younger,4.8,"Not sure what else needs to be said about this beer, it's pretty close to perfection for the style. A little on the light side, piney and bitter with a touch of sweetness. Intense flavors and very very smooth."
70,NeilSilber1,Pliny The Younger,5,"Pours golden yellow with slight white lacing crown on special edition (once a year) draught at Malibu Wine & Beer. Notes of honey and crisp perfect hops, slightly sweet with a perfect hop punch. This limited batch hard to get pour drinks like a single IPA but checked in at hefty 10.25% ABV putting it into triple IPA category. CHEERS to Russian River and the perfect IPA."
71,TheIPAHunter,Pliny The Younger,4.71,"Intense gummy bear nose. Taste is soft stone fruit, green pear, grapefruit rind, and an absolute blast of pine resin. Prickly mouthfeel. Dry, bitter finish. Phenomenal."
72,Sandis,Coconut Vibes - Barrel-Aged,5,Bottle share with Rob. For me this is about as good as beer gets. Wonderful mouthfeel and coconut flavor.
73,cdinardo21,Coconut Vibes - Barrel-Aged,4.38,"2023 bottle. Aromas and flavors are dominated by coconut; not sure if this bottle was off, but got a heavy alcohol bite up front. It mellowed mid palate, but still was offputting. Very thick and smooth from a mouthfeel perspective. Honestly enjoyed Batch 3 of the non-ba version of this better than the 2023 bottle. Shame I missed 2019 at Stout Week - was hoping to compare."
74,Holderness,Coconut Vibes - Barrel-Aged,4.21,"2023 vintage. Pours nearly still and super syrupy in the glass with noticeable congealed coconut fat in suspension. Not exactly the most appealing, but definitely sets the stage in terms of viscocity. This is easily the most coconut-forward beer I've ever had -- both the aromas and flavors are dominated by intense notes of shredded coconut, coconut macaroon, and coconut ice cream. Quite perceivable booziness in the aromas in particular, but things are smoothed out by the liquid brownie batter character in the flavors quite nicely. Hugely thick, velvety, and viscous, the mouthfeel is only knocked down a hair by the near-cloying sweetness. It's definitely a punch-you-in-the-face kind of beer. Leaps and bounds beyond the other coconut-forward BA stouts out there? Not really. But it is damn decadent

85/100"
75,Beerbom,Coconut Vibes - Barrel-Aged,4.17,I kinda wish there was more toasted coconut and less young coconut in this bad boy.
76,REVZEB,Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,4.34,"Had after having the non-ba version. Yeah, the barrel helped! Instead of a sugary finish, now there is a sweet and booze concoction. The barrel isn't complex but it smooths out the balance here, allowing the coconut, vanilla and chocolate to shine without any getting too strong. Smell really shows this off, where taste the cumulative sweetness does start to get on the radar. Still a very good dessert stout"
77,PDinunzi,Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,1.45,My bottle was heavily infected. 2022. Anyone else have this happen?
78,CarolinaCardinals,Fundamental Observation,4.49,"Received a 2022 bottle from @Beersnake1 3-13-23. Reviewed 12-14-23.

Beer poured black with a very nice tan head with the initial pour-4.25.

Nose is awesome as i am getting a medium roasted malt base that absorbs the rest in the bourbon barrels which lends notes of cocoa and bourbon. The vanilla adjunct is very prevalent and lends a nice tangent-4.5.

Taste is a medium roasted malt base that gives a big dose of vanilla up front with the barrels lingering in the background. With subsequent sips the blast of vanilla is coalescing with the barrels and am getting cocoa presumably from the choice of malts used. Finishes almost sweet but hopping and the barrels take that away-4.5.

Mouthfeel is very good as the large malt base is very viscous and each sip delightfully smooth-4.5.

Overall, initially graded Taste at 4.25 because it seemed to have too much vanilla but as my palate acclimated everything came together very nicely. A big thanks to Tim for a very generous trade! Overall rating 4.49."

80,Rug,Fundamental Observation,4.54,"2023 vintage

Afterr being impressed by my first few Bottle Logic beers, I’ve landed their white whale. This currently sits as the 17th highest rated beer on BA, their highest rated brew. I’ve been wanting to try this one for quite some time, so let’s just get right into it

Pours completely pitch black with 2 fingers of frothy dark brown head that slowly fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing

The nose is sweet but quite complex. I’m picking up on aromas of vanilla bean, burnt caramel, earthy bourbon, brown sugar, molasses, toasted oak, walnut, chocolate fudge, raisin, and light roast coffee

It’s very similar in taste and I have absolutely no complaints about that. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting chocolate fudge, vanilla bean, dark bread, caramel, medium roast coffee, sweet bourbon, charred oak, raisin, brown sugar, and light molasses. The swallow brings notes of toasted oak, molasses, vanilla bean, walnut, dark chocolate, medium roast coffee, black cherry, burnt caramel, sweet bourbon, and raisin

A medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a silky beer. Finishes surprisingly dry for how sweet it is and drinks below its abv

Oh man, this one absolutely lives up to the hype! I was a bit hesitant given how sweet it is, but it remains very balanced throughout. Great stuff"
81,dafla67,Fundamental Observation,4.71,"Pours a deep, dark brown color. Aroma is a wonderful combination of rich chocolate, deep vanilla with hints of bourbon and dark fruits. Taste is really intense combination following nose -- dark chocolate, strong vanilla, fruity and bourbon flavors. Mouthfeel is full bodied. Overall incredible stout."
82,Jwale73,Fundamental Observation,4.44,"2022 vintage (batch 8) served in my Bruery snifter. Pours one shade shy of black. Complexion is opaque. Head ins loose and mocha-colored and quickly disperses into a tight band around the shoulders and an oily slick across the surface. Nose is decadent vanilla, caramel, cocoa and spirits. This is going to be decadently sweet! Taste follows nose - spirits are subdued and only come out at the finish. The rest is just pure candy. Mouthfeel is medium in body with a semi-still carbonation. Overall, an amazing imperial stout."
83,SpeedwayJim,Fundamental Observation,4.54,"500ml capped bottle into a BBT snifter. 

Pours with a 1 finger dark mocha head. Beer pours heavy, pitch black, viscous. Sticky, mocha legs. Nose is chocolate, vanilla, molasses, and barrel. Pungent and rich. Beer opens chocolate, vanilla, and fudge. Hints of cocoa powder and roasted malt. Big barrel overtones. More vanilla and molasses in the finish. Body is full with low carbonation. Sticky and viscous on the palate and goes down warm with a long, lingering, sticky aftertaste.

This is great. Simple but well made. Amazing body."
84,BubalooBrewMaster,Fundamental Observation,4.89,One of my favorites from BL... I only had B1 a few years ago but Im catching up on my reviews.
85,Whyteboar,Fundamental Observation,4.68,"Received from a generous person in a NBS BIF back in 2020 and split with a friend soon thereafter. This is from the notes.
Pours the color of strong coffee (""Stout Black"" I like to call it) and is light blocking dark in the glass with just a little walnut hue on the edges. The deep brown head is inviting and slow to dissipate.
The aroma gave me vanilla first, bourbon second, and the menagerie of dark fruits, chocolate, coffee, wood, char that make up the malts contribution to the smells. Very nice, if a little more vanilla than expected.
The taste was solid. The vanilla, so heavily featured in the aroma, was first on the tongue, followed and overwhelmed my the coffee-chocolate-dark fruits almost cake like in effect; not sweet exactly, just decadent (if that makes any sense) The bourbon was in the swallow, terminating the pastry party effectively.
The feel was a viscous pleasure. For such an ABV I like something with heft, or body - to sip and savor, not quaff down like some AAL. This nicely fits my preferences almost perfectly.
Would love to try again, but glad I got to try it at least once."
86,AzfromOz,Fundamental Observation,4.23,"Received from the ever-generous @turkeysdrinkbeer in August 2022, and drunk in May 2023. 

L: Thick, jet black. Utterly still. There's a thin coat of rusty, coppered-coloured foam atop the glass. 

S: Umami roastiness, booze, vanilla, dark chocolate, cocoa, and ethereal spirit notes from the bourbon. Surprisingly, this didn't change much as the beer warmed. 

T: Vanilla and bourbon notes dominate the initial swallow, and then a wave of booze crashes over the top, burning throat, tongue and larynx like a good RIS should. There's a tangy hit of malt and then a retronasal whack of cookie dough settles in and lingers long. Warmth settles in the stomach and a medicinal sweetness slides in after the cookie dough fades. There's an excellent balance to this beer - there's no danger of cloying sweetness, nor is there so much stickiness that wasps begin to hover expectantly around my head. 

M: Mouthfeel is thick and unctuous - there's minimal carbonation but it suits the beer well. As noted above there's warmth seeping lazily through my body at the halfway mark of this one, and it settles deep and comfortably, like an old, familiar couch.

O: This is an enjoyable but intense beer experience. There's no likelihood of a second beer after you've spent an hour or so in the company of this beer, but the size of this beer means that's not a problem. 

Cheers!

87,mschrei,Fundamental Observation,4.75,"A real sweet treat. It’s like a piece of Portillo’s chocolate cake soaked in some tasty bourbon and then poured into a glass. Plenty of vanilla presence too. Full bodied, big, bold, boozy, and in no way overly thick, oily, or cloying. A nice slow sipper, because it really improves and opens up as it sits in the glass for a few hours."
88,Hobbs87,Very Hazy,4.36,Another really good beer from Tree House Brewing. I wouldn't personally say it’s as good as King Julius but more people may prefer since it’s not as strong and sweet. It’s between Gggreen and KJ. Has a very nice aroma and orange citrus taste but not overwhelming by any means. Highly recommend it.
89,Darkmagus82,Very Hazy,4.42,"Poured from a can into a teku glass 
Appearance – As the name hinted at, the beer pours a super hazy orange juice and tangerine color with a big rocky head of white foam. The head has an amazing level of retention, fading slowly over time and leaving a ton of foamy lace on the sides of the glass. 
Smell – The aroma is heavy of a orange juice and tropical fruit aroma of tangerine, pineapple and a bit of mango. Along with these aromas comes some strong herbal and floral smells as well as a bit of a grapefruit hop. Other aromas of passionfruit and a bit of lemon and lime are in there as well. With notes of apricot and peach, and a bit of bread rounding it all out a rather inviting aroma is produced overall.
Taste – The taste starts out with a bready and chewy doughy flavor mixed with lots of fruit. The fruit is heaviest of a tropical nature, with lots of tangerine, papaya, pineapple, and passionfruit, but the taste also has a decent showing of apricot and pear. The hops are there from the start, with a decent showing of a herbal and earthy hop flavor paired with some grapefruit. The hop grows stronger as the taste advances, all while the sweet fades a tad. Some more dankness comes to the tongue at the end of the taste transition, and with a bit of mustiness and a raw green hop taste, one is left with a rather malty and juicy, well hopped taste to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is very thick and chewy with a moderate level of carbonation. Great for the higher abv, malty nature, and mix of hop. Rather well done on the feel.
Overall – Another, slightly more malty, fresh hopped, and thicker, but balanced and very enjoyable brew. Well worth a try if you have the opportunity."
90,MVotter,Very Hazy,4.88,"L - Pours into a chalice a hazy, creme-yellow, with a 1 inch head, slight lacing.
S - Fresh hops, citrus.
T - Hop tang. Blend of grapefruit and orange peel.
F - Medium mouthfeel, some effervescence.
O - The overall experience is tasty and thirst-quenching, another impressive effort by Treehouse!"
91,DokiDokiLitFam,Very Hazy,4.66,"As the extension of Hazy, its got the peach and the orange, but most importantly its got the papaya note. That unique tropical tone that Haze does so well. Beautiful pour, amazing bouquet, great mouthfeel. Just a great DIPA from Tree House. You already know the deal."
92,Beginner2,Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,4.2,"This Brand, particularly with the Coffee, has gotten too carried away with itself and left me behind. It's all good, but it's not all this good to boast a 4.67 average... and certainly isn't World-Class in my book. In particular, the coffee is too prominent. Stouts are about blending malts, not blending coffee. Dark malts and coffee are usually at opposite ends of the day and for good reason: they really don't complement one another much, except in a very narrow range and with some brewer's luck.

This rendition (Burundi Turihamwe) was worth having. It is not worth having again. And it will never be worth the price. But, it was in my cellar and this is the month to clean it out. And for that I am grateful."
93,txaudiophile,Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,4.7,"My favorite Bourbon County yet. Tastes a lot like the original, except the added coffee makes it even better. A masterpiece from them."
94,papposilenus,Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,3.99,"From a 500ml bottle, labeled 2022. Drink by 09/06/24. Served in a spiegelau ba tulip glass.

Pours chestnut-brown with a finger of chocolatey foam. The head holds up for under a minute, leaving a thin collar and a barely rousable, thin sheet of oily lacing.

Nose is rich and intense. Robust aroma of dark chocolate and molasses.

Taste pretty much as expected, but sweeter. Tasting chocolate syrup, malt syrup, dark brown sugar, cocoa nibs. Very little detectable coffee presence, just a hint of vaporous mocha along with the smoky bourbon late in the sip and in the sinuses.

Feel is dense, silky. A thick, syrupy body with vanishingly gentle, fine, prickly carbonation. A mild tannic film lingers on the tongue.

Overall, sweet, heavy and overly syrupy to my taste. In fact, more syrupy and hefty? than I remember straight Bourbon County being - if I’m remembering right."
95,beerbully,Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,4.61,"L- Black, opaque....moderate 1 finger head with little retention....quickly settles to a mocha ring.....lacing is minimal with little retention

T- Follows the nose....big notes of chocolate and coffee.....followed by some Barrell and booze.....some vanilla and molasses.....finish is dark chocolate

F- Thick and creamy.....subtle carbonation....slight heat from the booze....thick and viscous....leaves a coating around the mouth

O- Excellent brew"
96,mickyge,Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,4.34,"Poured in a tulip glass right from the refrigerator. Dark almost black color, thin head that dissipates quickly to a thin cap, nice lacing.

Taste is nice subtle notes of coffee, chocolate, roasted malt and vanilla become more pronounced as it warms up.
Mouthfeel is silky smooth, low carbonation, slightly thin ish. Finishes a with a lingering coffee chocolate slightly bitter feel.
To me it’s easy drinking and nice layers of flavor. Wish I bought more."
97,NeutroMan,Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,4.25,"500mL bottle into a goblet. Opaque reddish-tinged dark brown color with a short-lived mahogany head.

Now this is a special one, the highest rated English Barleywine on BA, VSOJ! A long time want of mine, I wanted to try it while I have the Double Barrel VSOJ on the way thanks to Tavour. I’ve had the OG Straight Jacket and some variants before, but this is by far the most exciting. Let’s get into it

Pours an opaque dark brown with 2 fingers of tan head that slowly fades to a thin ring and leaves minimal lacing

The nose brings an intense wave of sweetness, but it’s balanced out by spicier notes. I’m picking up on aromas of burnt caramel, sweet whiskey, molasses, rye bread, golden raisin, brown sugar, charred oak, old leather, fig, tobacco, and sweet toffee

Wow, everything in taste is kicked up a notch, boozy and fruity but not overly sweet. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting fig, sweet toffee, burnt caramel, black cherry, molasses, dry oak, vanilla, earthy whiskey, and light brown sugar. The swallow brings notes of sweet whiskey, charred oak, molasses, rye bread, tobacco, raisin, brown sugar, burnt caramel, vanilla, old leather, and light toffee

A medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a slick beer. Finishes a tad sticky and boozy, yet still drinks well below the listed 15%

Oh yeah, this is one hell of a beer. As expected from Revolution, it’s so much thinner in execution in relation to the flavor. I can’t wait to try the Double Barrel VSOJ next"
100,DIM,V.S.O.J.,4.8,"Oh damn this absolutely lives up to its reputation. Nothing unfamiliar in a barleywine here but there is a lot going on and everything is so BIG. 2-4 years in barrels adds such a layer of... profundity to the already stellar Straight Jacket. I feel underdressed, semi-literate, and unwashed sipping on this.

Raisins, molasses, high end whiskey, and leather dominate. There is a lot more at the edges though, candied nuts, honey, pipe tobacco, and a hell of a lot more. Such enveloping, deep warmth but not at all hot. People with access to Revolution are lucky indeed. Thanks so much FBarber!"
101,stevoj,V.S.O.J.,4.26,"12oz can at share. Dark brown pour with a foamy beige head. Aroma is malty, toffee, prunes, , hint of vanilla. Taste is malty, leathery, sweet, caramel, light chocolate, pit fruit. Smooth and strong. Aroma of malt, chocolate, caramel, vanilla and bourbon. Malty and caramelly flavor with chocolate and raisin leading into a vanilla and bourbon finish. Had side by side with Straight Jacket and this one definitely smelled and tasted more chocolatey and caramelly; more decadent. World class BW."
102,ovaltine,V.S.O.J.,4.71,"Pours a rich dark brown color that is impenetrable by light and features a creamy mocha colored head that lingers a bit before dissipating to allow you to focus on the beautiful beer in your glass and the aromas drawing you closer.

And what magnificent aromas greet you - rich English toffee, vanilla, a bit of fig, oak, and a smidge of booze, all in perfect balance. I am literally drooling.

The toffee is forward on the taste as expected, but it willingly allows room for the vanilla (hurray!), oak (double hurray!), and especially the fig (cubed hurray!) that provides balance to the sweetness of the other components and coasts into the boozy warming at the back of the palate. Simply stunning flavor profile and nuance to a beer this big (13.8% ABV).

The mouthfeel is creamy and more than a bit oily, as expected. I sat on this a bit, and it was more than worth the wait. Truly a world class English barleywine."
103,Benish,Double Barrel V.S.O.J.,4.53,"Darker in color compared to straight jacket. Very smooth with so much depth. Compared to the regular straight jacket, this one is far more robust, less sweet, but with heavy prunes, toffee, bourbon, and even a hint of white wine. No alcohol burn so you have to watch yourself!"
104,sulldaddy,Double Barrel V.S.O.J.,4.8,"sampling a 12 oz can poured into my snifter at cellar temp. Date stamp is 12/29/2022.
The beer pours a dark rich mahogany color into my glass. Only the lightest tints of light get through the glass.
A fizzy beige head of 1 cm foams up but fades to a thin edge layer quickly after the pour. The edging does stick around for most of the sampling.
Aroma is toffee, brown sugar, some bourbony/rye sweetness, a bit of dry wooden barrel, almost like a popsicle stick note. There are hints of fusol booze here too, but no hop notes that I can detect.
First sip reveals a fairly robust body and syrupy texture. Carbonation is fine and tingly, sticky coating on my palate after each sip. Swallow reveals a bit of warmth on the finish. Physical traits make this a sipping beer.
Flavor is similar to what the nose predicts with malt forward character. I get toffee, brown sugar and general malt sweetness. There is a rye/bourbon note that carries through for sure and I keep tasting maple syrup, even though I dont think thats an additive. I dont get any hop character on this beer. Booze is limited to warmth, with no peppery bite or spiciness.
A sweeter sipping beer that I am enjoying and very happy to have had the chance to drink tonight while watching Dallas vs Seattle."
105,SpeedwayJim,Double Barrel V.S.O.J.,4.81,"12oz. Can I to a BBT snifter. 

Pours coca cola. Near flat. No head, no lace. Super thick, oily lace. Nose is rich and aromatic. Notes of nutmeg, hazelnut, brown sugar, and molasses. Booze is apparent but subtle. Beer opens chocolate, brown sugar, anise, and dried dark fruit. Molasses, barrel, sweet cream, and breakfast syrup in the middle and end. Oak, some tobacco, and burnt brown sugar at the end and aftertaste. Body is medium to full with low carbonation. Slick and oily on the palate and goes down rich and slightly boozy. Dry, lingering aftertaste that goes on for days. 

This is the perfect English Barleywine. Insanely well integrated and complementary flavor profile with a body to match. Incredible."

Label says aged 7 months in Woodford Reserve Double Oaked barrels, then transferred to Willett bourbon barrels for an additional 11 months. Served in a snifter, the beer pours a very dark brown color with about a half inch tan head that didn't stick around for too long. Not much lacing at all. I like the aroma, the brew smells like dark fruit, bourbon, vanilla, brown sugar, caramel and toffee. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's the addition of some oak and molasses flavors. Mostly sweet tasting but not overwhelming at all. Nice oaky/woodiness lingering in the finish. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's coating and syrupy with a moderate amount of carbonation. A little boozy, but doesn't seem like it's 17% either. I thought this was a pretty good barleywine, definitely worth trying if you get the chance!

109,jrc1093,A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,4.23,"2022 vintage; consumed on 9/6/2023

Pours a silky, stark midnight-brown body capped with over a finger of pale khaki foam; decent head retention leaves a spotty layering of cap, slim, frothy collar, and no lacing holding to the walls of the glass.

Aromas of heavy leather guide to fig compote and gooey caramel, with toffeed roast and cocoa subtleties sink into resounding plum port, leaving charry barrel building through lingering overtones of red currant syrup.

Taste offers a potent barrel overlay, coursing over a subtle cocoa dusting as is leather interspersed through the mid-palate and red currant syrup is leveled by a fervent oak backing into the finish.

Mouthfeel shows a medium body with minimal carbonation, settling a slick texturing over the mid-palate as a pseudo-grit hovers in the backdrop; barrel tannins spark through the backend while an impressive warmth remains level across the entirety of the palate.

Latent intensity perpetuates an exercise in indulgence, indulging unrepentant sweetness contained by massive barrel presence in a viscous liquid form; an American Barleywine testing the bounds of the style."

Opaque brown pour with ruby hues and clarity under fast fizzy tan head; no cap retention, ring nor lace; medium plus legs. Bourbon and caramel nose; boozy retro nasal. Taste follows nose with plum pudding, sugary raisins, toasted brown sugar and molasses; figs as beer warms. Full minus body; viscous feel; face warming from 17% abv; light carbonation.

111,JohnG190,A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,4.91,"Anchorage Brewing’s A Deal with the Devil Double Oak-Aged Barleywine is an extraordinary beer that left a lasting impression on my taste buds. The combination of its rich double oak aging and complex flavors creates a truly remarkable experience. The aroma greets you with notes of caramel, vanilla, and subtle hints of bourbon, setting the stage for what’s to come.

The taste is where this beer truly shines. The double oak aging process imparts a smoothness that is both velvety and warming. It boasts a perfect balance of malty sweetness, dark fruit flavors, and a delicate touch of oak and bourbon. As it warms up, the complexities further unfold, revealing layers of complexity that keep you intrigued throughout each sip.

The mouthfeel is luxurious and full-bodied, showcasing the craftsmanship behind this beer. The finish is long-lasting, leaving a pleasant aftertaste that beckons you to take another sip.

While this is certainly not an everyday beer due to its higher ABV, it is undeniably a treat worth savoring on special occasions or for those seeking an indulgent experience. Its bold flavors and well-crafted profile make it a standout among barrel-aged beers.

Whether you’re an avid beer enthusiast or simply looking to try something exceptional, Anchorage Brewing’s A Deal with the Devil Double Oak is undoubtedly a top-tier choice that I highly recommend. Cheers!"

Taste takes it a step further: honestly SP's best non-fruit wild saison, if not their best saison period. Add passion fruit, pear, and a whisper of grapefruit to the fruit from the nose, oak is now toasty and bright, vinous kiss adds layers in a gentle way, floral tones are more generic compared to nose though, must and funk elevate.

This smells like a sort of rustic oak thing, lemon peel, stone fruit, white wine, candied orange, and a dry hay like quality.

This is a blend of Flora, Art, and Ann, so it’s not surprising at all that this is really good. Having had all of those at this point, I wouldn’t say any one beer entirely stands out – this becomes its own thing that stands completely on its own, and might be better than each of the three titans that contributed. It’s very oaky, and orange-like, with a hay-like dry finish that is just so refreshing. There’s also stone fruit, white wine, dried lemon peel, with a restrained and very pleasant acidity.

This is light bodied, clean, lightly and pleasantly tart, and super drinkable.

This is absolutely fantastic, and might just crack the top 5 of Hill Farmstead beers that I’ve had – it’s just such a good and clearly deliberate blend."
118,mothman,Clover,4.7,"Bottle. 2020 edition. At HF brewery.

White head with some lace. Clear golden color. 

Such an excellent saison. Definitely has flavors of the base beers. Elegant is a great word for this beer. Drinks like a white wine maybe a Chardonnay. White grapes, oak, green apples, faint saison spice, wheat. Dry and bubbly. Smooth, light, easy drinking. Faint tartness, nice citrus."
119,micada,Clover,4.79,"Had at a Mortalis share. Definitely one of those taste the country yellow beers. Tart, crisp, light. Not my style, but come on now…these bottles shares are amazeballs. Lots of oak dryness."
120,Bhubbard34,Clover,4.71,"Had b2 and b3 side by side. This rating is for b2, which was better in just about every category than b3. B3 wasnt bad by any means, but b2 was an amazing farmhouse ale /saison"
121,Sabtos,Clover,4.74,"Clear yellow-gold with minimal head formation dying to a clear, bubbly and uneven surface that disperses to a bubbly flat collar. The appearance was impressively identical between two different batches, which we were fortunate enough to enjoy in one evening.

Starting with batch 2, the oak is very expressive, yet gentle at the same time, backed by reduced citrus juice characteristics like grapefruit, orange and lemon. This was a smaller pour than I had of batch 3, but the contrasts were stark, while the more obscure parallels somehow held firm.

Out of batch 3, I perceive a larger presence of straw and young oak up front, but this quickly gives way to more acid than b2, while yet remaining palatably balanced. This acidity expresses like yellow raspberry and seedy passion fruit, countered by a frothy body that exhales refined oak threads. While that Ann oak in conjunction with the subtle funk of Art solidly affirm their support, it was clear that Flora's return to the blend saw her influence well exerted here.

This has been a very long time coming for me, and contrary to most experiences with meeting your idols, this did not let me down. I came away preferring b3, though absent of overwhelming confidence, as they were both phenomenal in different ways."
122,4DAloveofSTOUT,Clover,4.48,"Bottle Conditioning since December 23, 2020. So, I believe batch 3.

Lemon & lime with soft oak & light earth. Vinous white wine notes. Lower carbonation."
123,jb_4226,Chemtrailmix - Rye Barrel,4.9,"#184, so good!"
124,BEERchitect,Chemtrailmix - Rye Barrel,4.52,"Putting a little pep in your step and numbing the senses all at once, 3 Floyd's pink peppercorn and cinnamon Dark Lord variant takes this Imperial Stout to the nuclear level.... and with snacks.

Jet black and pouring like ink, Chemtrailmix alerts the nose with a strong, savory and sultry blend of coffee, cocoa, whisky, spice, port wine and sherry. As the inky elixir hits the tongue, the taste is enlivened with the sweetness of brown sugar, blackstrap molasses, toffee, honey and caramel with hints of chocolate and condensed fruit.

As the stout extends across the middle palate, the sweetness slowly turns to dry. A rise of espresso, baker's chocolate, roasted nuttiness and campfire char keeps the session hefty before the spices of cinnamon and peppercorn tease the palate with a gentle dry prickle. Trending warm with rye whisky and oak, the late palate trends coconut-like with vanilla, earthen grit and caramel with those savory aged port and sherry savory qualities.

Full bodied, pleasantly chewy and off-cloying, Chemtrailmix finishes malty-dry, spicy and very warm. With impressions of sherry and coconut lingering in aftertaste, this calls for a long, patient and sipping session with high rewards and a surprising rate of drinkability if you can tolerate the combination of whisky and spice."
125,ovaltine,Chemtrailmix - Rye Barrel,4.74,"Pours a pure, coal black color with a sudsy dark tan head that is fairly quick to flee. The nose features the cinnamon up front and with extreme prejudice - this is bigly cinnamon. There’s also a nice spicy note from the peppercorn and some chocolate and a subtle barrel note.

The barrel is more pronounced on the taste, and a perfect, spicy complement to the peppercorn flavor - and the still bigly cinnamon, which is delicious. There’s also chocolate and a surprising bit of stone fruit. There’s a LOT going on here and it’s all magnificent, IMHO.

The mouthfeel is velvety and coats the mouth properly, commensurate with a beer of this magnitude. What a pleasure it is to finally experience this world class beer."
126,Sandis,Chemtrailmix - Rye Barrel,4.52,2020 version poured from a 750ml bottle into a snifter. Heavy cinnamon on the nose and in the flavor with a mild spice. Nicely thick. A little chocolate and barrel mixed in. Happy to finally try this.
127,Zach_Attack,Chemtrailmix - Rye Barrel,4.75,"Dig the cinnamon a lot, with a unique peppery spice; supremely fudgy body that lingers; nice barrel too."
128,OfficerKramitz,Chemtrailmix - Rye Barrel,4.73,"L. Deep brownish black with a slight light brown head 

S: Sweet burnt sugar. Almost a hint of molasses. Heavy “cinamonny” like cinnamon toast crunch 

T. Ultra sweet up front, but works and becomes balanced with the cinnamon. Can’t really get the pepper tastes besides slightly on the tongue but know it’s there for the balance. Finishes with a faint rye whiskey flavor. 

F. Viscous which coats the mouth. Proper thickness 

O. This beer is superb, well balanced overall. Much like a liquid cinnamon toast crunch and sweet cinnamon roll. Couldn’t have more than one glass. Extremely decadent"
129,Mar02x,Monster Tones,4.87,"My expectations were high beforehand but this stout made it all come true and a bit more.

132,Zach_Attack,Monster Tones,4.82,"This is everything I thought it could be and oh so much more. Chocolate dominates the nose and palate for me, with smooth bourbon, natural vanilla, rich coconut, and fudge. The mouthfeel is exactly what I expect from MT - positively scrumptious."

135,NewtotheBrew,Julius,3.34,"Not bad, very crisp, bright, mango/ lemon. OK after taste,"
136,Smakawhat,Julius,4.53,"Poured from the can into a taster glass.

Light off white top of three fingers, a light retention with nice lacing. Pale orange body, with an opaque but light hinting appearance. 

Chewy aroma of impeccable Creamsicle hop orange flavor. Slight popsicle sweetness, touching vanilla, very impressive. Slight malt biscuit cookie it seems also. Something out of a crafted dessert but total beer richness. Stunning.

Delicious palate. Creamy and somehow with a malt dryness that hits with excellent hop character. Creamed flour it seems, citrus orange and fluffy like in texture and taste. Dare I even say touches of marshmallow and sweet exotic marmalade. Not a hint of boozy heat either.

Very impressive and stupidly enjoyable. True winner."
137,Shanex,Julius,4.85,"Julius came my way thanks to DoctorZombies 

Incredibly well crafted, from the foam, its appearance or the tasty, not overly juicy aromas and flavors. 

More than a winner overall, this beer is worth it."
138,Darkmagus82,Julius,4.44,"Poured from a can into a teku glass
Appearance – The beer pours a very hazy orange color with a big puffy head of off-white foam. THE head has a great level of retention, fading very slowly over time and leaving tons of streaky lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell -The aroma is big of a musty grainy and bready smell mixed with lots of raw hop aromas of a herbal and earthy nature. There are other citrus aromas of orange and tangerine as well as hints of grapefruit mixed within. Notes of apricot and some grass are in there as well, giving a rather raw and sorta green smell to the brew overall.
Taste – The taste starts out drier than one would anticipate from the nose. It begins with a mix of bready and cracker malt flavors combined with hop flavors of a very potent herbal and grapefruit hop. Notes of a floral and pine hop flavor are there as well, but these tastes are light in comparison to the herbal hop. All the hop flavors are rather “raw” in nature, having an almost hop pellet like flavor associated with them. These potent flavors are the dominant ones throughout much of the taste. While said, there is a decent showing of fruit flavors of tangerine, peach, and apricot, as well as a hint of mango. The mix of sweet, bready and hop take the taste to its end, where it leaves one with a rather green hopped and slightly fruity and malty taste to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body is a bit more on the creamy and chewy side with a carbonation level that is on the more moderate side. For the rich hop and malt flavors the feel is well done and makes for a nice easy sipper.
Overall – A very nice brew overall. I think I like this better than the King Julius as it is more approachable from my standpoint, but hits all the same high notes as the king variety. Big and flavor and drinkability with a nice blend of hop, malt, and fruit."
139,SHODriver,Fou' Foune,5,"Bottled in 2016

A: Poured into a tulip glass to a light golden yellow beer which is topped by a dense and fluffy finger and a half of white head which fades slowly to a collar around the edge of the glass with minimal lacing
S: Smells of apricots, hints of sourness, some chalky yeast and a touch of funk
T: Taste is building sourness up front with some nice apricot notes followed by some nice funk. Sourness is under control and not too aggressive with more apricots and more funk with some pale malty flavors coming through as well. On the finish there's some lemony tartness, more apricot, some lingering funk and a touch of chalky yeast.
M: This beer has a body which is on the lighter side of medium. Carbonation is lightly effervescent while the beer has a drying finish due to the acidity.
O: Overall this beer is outstanding. Great flavors and complexity. I probably should have drank this one sooner but it still tastes fantastic."
140,jzeilinger,Fou' Foune,4.56,"A HUGE thank you to tacosandbeer for this bottle!

A - Hazy medium orange gold colored pour with bright white, creamy lacing circling the top of the glass.

S - Massive tart, jammy, apricot with a little bit of funk going down.

T - Not as sour / tart as the nose would suggest (though still puckering). Lots of apricot jam tartness that lingers on the palate (and then some). 

M - Big body with vibrant carbonation giving a soft texture leaving the entire mouth watering.

O - Straight up apricot with just the right amount of twangy zing. Pretty darn impressive and something special right here."
141,REDAMI,Fou' Foune,4.68,"Poured from 750ml bottle into Spencers goblet.

L - Pale, hazy apricot gold pour with a topping of thin white foam, which disperses to a mild lacing.

S - Tart, sugary apricot jam with perhaps a touch of cinnamon and creamy vanilla.

T - Sharp sourness, almost vinegary acidity, underripe fruit, and a slight doughy grain flavor.

F - Stinging carbonation, juicy to start with a dry finish.

A beautifully crafted lambic which avoids the pitfalls of many other examples of the style (too sweet or too woody). The fruit is used to soften the lambic base. Excellent!"
142,RaulMondesi,Fou' Foune,4.25,"On tap at Windsor Homebrew in Anaheim, CA.

This one is like Van Gogh if he was medicated or something: the wildness is still there in its way, but now there is balance. It’s all pretty and fine, but it’s missing a bit of rage. And who doesn’t like that? Good, but Raul wouldn’t chop an ear off to get another pour.

As it warms, so does Raul…"
143,Smakawhat,Very Green,4.65,"Poured from the can into a Spiegelau IPA glass.

Creamed white four to three finger tall filled head out of the can into the glass. Pill laced and fine bubbled, sitting on a simple opaque not quite turbid but faint caramel brown and tinged yellow color.

Delicious hop forward aroma, mostly minty with light touches of herbal like sweet tea. Touches even a little bit of bringing caramel malt to the table for balance too, and maybe some hinting fruit notes that are really covered over by this perfume like mint that really dominates. Very enjoyable and unique nose.

Oh is this palate gangbusters. Silky and perfect creamy texture, mixing with just the right amount of malt sweetness and depth to stay away from sugar and syrupy overtones. Juiced light pineapple and mint, with sweet flavors that go from vanilla to just about every tropical fruit flavor imaginable. Creamed mint and ice cream on the finish, and yes.. Wait for it… real hop bitterness that punctures through it all. Hits with just the right amount of herbal and mint green heat on the finish to contrast the sweetness perfectly.

Wow, real stunner just what I would want in a NEIPA also."
144,Sheppard,Very Green,4.18,"Pours that classic Tree House yellowish orange opaqueness. Has the aroma of the orange flavored jelly beans. Maybe a touch of earthiness beneath the mostly tropical and citrus aroma. This really reminds me of Green and doesn't really ""feel"" bigger. It's citrusy with lot of zest qualities. Perhaps some textured minerality. It's dry so I don't get as much tropical fruit or fleshy citrus as other Galaxy forward beers. Ultimately, this is just good but not great."

148,brentk56,Very Green,4.08,"Appearance: Pours a cloudy goldenstraw with a two finger head; strong retention and a few shards and squiggles linger

Smell: Tropical notes of mango, pineapple and orange rind; dank and somewhat grassy

Taste: Tropical fruit forward with the mango and pineapple leading the impression; through the middle, there is bitter orange rind; the finish is a bit green (might I say very green) with a grassy aspect

Mouthfeel: Meidum to full body and creamy; moderate carbonation with some hop burn

Overall: Decent but not among my favorites from Tree House due to the hop burn in the finish; I am somewhat surprised as I have really enjoyed the other beers I have tasted in the ""Green"" series"
149,bbtkd,Assassin,4.54,"Toppling Goliath Assassin 2023 BBA Imperial Stout, 15.% ABV. Pours thick and black with no head on a 5oz taproom pour into a tiny-ass glass.

Excellent thick and smooth mouthfeel, overall world class. Mega-boozy."
150,MonDak_Joe1953,Assassin,4.56,"Tap pour at Ansari's, during its 12 Beers of Toppling Goliath. 2022 vintage.
Black colored color. Light tan head; this quickly retreats to a thin ring. Leaves behind a clinging ring of lacing.
Aroma of bourbon barrel, dark roasted malts, oak, dark fruit, caramel, and chocolate.
Taste is sweet from the barrel and the malts. Flavors of bourbon soaked dark roasted malts, oak, cherry, prune, toffee, chocolate, and vanilla. Very smooth and lingering aftertaste.
Thick and sticky mouth feel. Higher ABV% is hidden but exudes vapors. Supportive carbonation.
Is a very tasty bourbon soaked treat."
151,Saylor,Assassin,5,"I had the pleasure of sharing the 2023 variety with a friend. Easily the best, beer especially stout, I’ve ever had. This puts those other mass produced, thin barrel stouts to shame.

153,JohnnyHopps,Assassin,4.79,"Appearance - The beer was an inky black color with a dark head clinging to the sides of the glass. 

Smell - Dark malts and barrel were the primary parts of the nose. 

Taste - Initially, the profile was thick boozy dark chocolate. The profile with sweet, but nowhere close to being cloying. Notes of raisin, tobacco, and a hint of vanilla followed. The chocolate goodness lingered in the aftertaste.

Mouthfeel - The feel was thick and sticky, clinging to the sides and top of the tongue. 

Overall - This beer was definitely hype worthy."
154,M-Fox24,Assassin,4.46,"A: A carbon black discharge to the carafe with a tap shoe hue, while the decanter rests on a woodsmoke tone, before the radiance pins a coloration near Kurotobi. The transfer(s) occur across natural nucleated sites, which avoids the unwanted lipids/impurities on the cross-reactions, for solidifications. Accordingly, a collar formation to the inch, as latticework – marginally – pushes through a rushed retreat. The brim comes in towards the .25in, which clings to the periods that reach 1cm, while the hours further the detachments per the foam-negative materials. With this in mind, the palette to the neck has a dark beige peak, as the rushed retreat has a mars brown rim. In turn, a viscosity factor that plays to the annulling properties aforesaid, which support the nuanced droplets that attune the advanced (teary) arches 

S: Malts frame the dexterities above a soft hop bill, while the oak casks work to build a complicated mass around the aged aldehydes. An ignition that politely connotes La Bête Noire with a Cajeta glaze, as figgy duff pairs alongside prunes + flame raisins. There is an oak stave to plank presence in exercise, which adds a dynamic balance to the sweet midsections. Supplementary to this, a calm hop effect that reinforces the barrel toned landscapes, when symbolizing forested alder to shagbark hickory. All the while, a ventilated deduction on the vintage, beyond the bettering cask aspects. This comes at a trained interval, which nears ≥68°F, for softening & blooming the – hourly – abstractions. Correspondingly, an enlightened (smart) complication that comes without additives, where the stability is maintained & rooted through coordination. The progression optimizes the breathing periods, by characterizing Palo Cortado through rawhide over clay pipes, outside the dried fruit subtexts over Atomic Fireballs. Moreover, a structure that continuously engages in complex polymers, when denoting lignins across tannins, in the act of rolling dry constitutions 

T: Soft barrel entitlements to the conversions set by diastatic enzymes, where hemicelluloses contribute to the cultured caramelization(s). Namely, maltol developments to the plot, for signifying doughy accounts on Nussbrezels under a Crème brûlée guise, as bourbon coats Chelan cherries + Moyer plums. The notations have a light implication on the makings that analog MalvaBons, while lightly addressing the oak lactones thru coconut. The age offers a refined sense on the phenolic aldehydes, as they lend vanilla by vanillin, which comes with a molasses – charred – nature. Howbeit, cautious to not exceedingly burn amid the oxidized transfers, across the carafe, where Fahrenheit gets incrementally pushed. There is a leathery standing behind the hydrolysable workings, which offer a steadying composure to the sweet malt passages. This is furthered by a low toned bitterness, when detailing the dark rosin inflections. Sequentially, a blooming allowance that recapitulates the sensed perceptions on sherry, where an oxidized nuttiness supplants English toffee. The sequences have dry – tannin derived – cessations, while carefully regulating spiced eugenols & smoked guaiacols, against the softly spoken (developed) acetaldehydes 

M: An intensity behind C₂H₆O that’s courteous to not suffocate, when attenuating sweetness. Thus, a treacly to thick mitigation with an alleviating bite, while the smooth ebullitions amalgamate over the tempered – carbonated – tiers. A feel that’s accompanied by age, besides the aeriated drafts, for paving a weathered maturity 

O: The degradations on hemicelluloses are rich in their pursuit on furfurals above ethyl acetates, which is fittingly appropriate, for perceiving malt. Oak compounds are continuous in the upsurge, of clocked intervals, as they are paired alongside the relaxed wooded hops. Correspondingly, a construction that offers more harmony, when providing the time with an uncapped patience"

156,Smakawhat,Very GGGreennn,4.62,"Poured from the can into a Spiegelau IPA glass. Buddy the elf what's your favorite color? Canned 12/20/2023.

Frothy and creamy forming head, four to easily three fingers tall of rich off white lather. Pill and ring lacing forming on a good slow sinking head, with lots of staying power. Creamed and turbid looking body, a little custard yellow with touches of brown.

Fantastic hop aroma. Perfume like tropical notes of pineapple and mango, a faint touch of caramel malt, lemon to lime citrus oil, and some faint smokey earth. Excellent nose that just whaffs of perfumed fruit bonanza.

Shocking palate. Classic and bold rich pineapple and juiced fruit in the mid palate, almost sillky like in feel. But it's the finish that is the real winner and shocker of a surprise. Ending and finish is full of a rich first mint, then bitter marmalade heat that just builds ever so slowly with the perfect amount of oily creep that hits out of nowhere. Litteraly juiced herbs is the only way I can describe it, and the sensation is phenomenal. Earth and mint perfume finish with matching tropical hop fruit.

Real crazy make up here and unlike anything I have had in the IPA realm in a long time. Very special beer."

Regular Green has this too, but it's much more prominent in VGgg. The bitterness is stronger than I remember, which is good - my one criticism the last time I had this was that it was a touch too sweet for my taste. Mouthfeel is typical for a Treehouse DIPA.

This one pours a hazy golden yellow color, with a small head, and lots of lacing.

This has kind of a dry sharpness to it – with a muddled hop character that just doesn’t pop anywhere as vibrantly as you’d expect from Tree House. There’s an odd little vegetal sweetness, too.

This is slightly creamy but not as drinkable as you’d want.

I have absolutely adored Tree House lately, but this was a bit of a misstep. It wasn’t horrible by any means, but very forgettable."

168,JohnnyHopps,Anabasis,4.65,"Appearance - the beer was almost black in appearance with some variation in color and little carbonation.

Smell - The nose was composed of the barrel and dark fruits. It lean toward the sweet side.

Taste - The bourbon barrel was strong with this one, but not hot. Notes of port, fruit, leather, tobacco, cherries, and oak were present. Needless to say, it was a diverse pallet. The port and oak notes really stood out. This was a sipper.

Mouthfeel - The body was not overly thick, especially when judged to today’s outrageous standards. Carbonation was muted.

Overall - This is an elite barleywine."
169,REVZEB,Anabasis,4.65,"Blend #5. Thanks to Luscious_Malfoy for hooking me up with this bottle! So the appearance is not a looker: sludgy brown body, no head, but the rest of this beer is breathtaking. Big rich and complex rustic bourbon barrel, barley, toasted caramel, tons of dark fruit, rye, molasses, char, black licorice, vanillins, and leather nose. Taste is similar: adds slight anise no licorice and char though, oxidized sugars with attached earthiness, vanillins emerge over time more. Feel is thick and warm with great barrel character, barley splashes on the palate in such a smooth way, luxurious and complex, though heavy. Met the hype!"

179,defunksta,CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),4.23,"Appearance: Pours a completely dark color with a massive dark tan head that pillows and lingers. (4.25)

Aroma: Strong aromas of cocoa, coffee, bittersweet notes upfront. Balanced and complex. (4.25)

Flavor: Strong flavors of cocoa and chocolate upfront that balance with coffee. Then a sweet and rich chocolate, bourbon, and maple flavor follow. Sweet with a mild coffee roast off the finish. (4.25) 

Feel: Heavier-bodied, strong carbonation. Mild roast. Smooth, heavy, but balanced and not too sweet. (4.00) 

Overall: First try at this World-Class rated Stout. Founders doesn't make bad ones so have high expectations. The pour is beautiful. Aromas are spot on. Chocolate, coffee, yet with a complexity you can't describe. Backs it up on the flavor with the addition of some maple, honey, and bourbon sweetness. Still complex with a balanced finish. Not sure why they held this one back and why it's not easy to find, but this could easily be an annual release. I've learned to try every stout from Founders without question. (Rating: 4.23)"
180,NickSMpls,CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),4.62,"Deep, rich pour. Nose is maple and bourbon, chocolate. First sip brings up the coffee and bourbon, dark chocolate follows close behind. Long finish. It's beer heaven."
181,tt100,CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),4.64,I always find it hard to believe they can make this taste aged when it's freshly bottled. Years ago the maple would be strong unless you waited on it. The last few years the maple is perfectly blended. Magical...
182,Cdriver0414,CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),5,I don't know what to say about this vmbeer that isn't already known. Founders makes some amazing stouts and this is one of their best. I cannot recommend it enough.
183,PaulMayer,CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),4.88,"This is sublime. I lack the experience or vocabulary to call myself a connoisseur or expert rater of beers, but at the moment I’m drinking this, it could be the most delicious beer I’ve ever had, even better than the Belgian quads I love so much. And when you get right down to it, any beer — or any food, any experience — that is this transcendentally satisfying deserves to be thought of as one of the best."
184,highdesertdrinker,CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),4.5,"Pours a deep brown with ample tan head. It smell like chocolate, dark malts, maple. The taste is chocolate, maple, a little coffee, some wood, barrel, a little dry with some hops. 
One of my favorite beers and certainly stouts and it is a smooth beverage that is dangerous drinkable, cheers!"
185,LeRose,CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),4.67,"This is a 2018 vintage bottle.

Pours opaque dark brown to black but with red and amber highlights on the edges when held up to light. Hefty khaki head that persists, falls to a modest cap, but foam coats the glass beautifully.

The aroma is great, but maybe subdued by age. Coffee and sweet chocolate, bourbon barrel and vanilla, base stout and very faint maple as if warms up. 

Taste - coffee, chocolate on the sweeter side, just a touch of bourbon, some vanilla and the maple shows up late but blends jn smoothly. All on top of roasty base grains and the OG stout. Superb, smoothly integrated. 

Feel is thick but not syrupy or sticky. It's not highly carbonated. Luxurious and smooth.

Tremendous beer - not much more thst one can say about it."
186,FRANKHAZE,CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),2.5,KBS is superior in all aspects and costs about 10$ less than a CBS 4-pack.. makes absolutely no sense to purchase this beer. KBS > CBS.

189,WickedBeer,Beer:Barrel:Time (Van Winkle 2023),4.69,"This bad boy is all barrel. Huge woody notes on the nose; undertones of smoke, vanilla & chocolate. Palate brings the same; dry, oakey, and full of barrel character. With time, the hints of bitterness imparted by the barrel are softened nicely by caramel."
190,Zaximus,Westly,3.77,"Very acidic. Subtle apricot. Based on this vintage, I prefer WA."
191,stevoj,Westly,4.26,"Sample at de Garde 10th Anniversary. Cloudy golden pour, small bubbly head. Aroma is stone fruit and grapes. Taste is fruity, tart with lots of funk and barrel notes."
192,Prospero,Westly,4.36,Fantastic golden hue and white foam head that emits a fresh apricot orchard like aroma. The aroma is a burst of freshly cut apricots and a hint of funk. Flavor is initially the fresh apricot flavor that's mostly sweet with tartness coming in behind it. The finish though is overwhelmingly sour. Great overall but acidity is strong with this one which detracts a bit from the sweet apricot fruit like notes I enjoy most.
193,jprock01,Samuel,3,"This is very good beer, but not worth $20 for 5 oz. at the brewery, so it ""soured"" my review. Side Project in St. Louis has equivalent beer at 1/3 the cost. I bought a six-pack of Westvleteren 12 for $25 in Belgium, a much better deal. It looks, smells, and tastes good for a sour beer, but not my favorite, and way over priced."
194,mothman,Samuel,4.9,"2020 vintage at the brewery bottled.

White head. Lace. Clear yellow gold color. Beautiful beer.

A bit tart, a bit citrusy, but refreshing and balanced. Green apples, white wine, and grapes. Earthy, wheat, light saison spice, but not like a Belgian saison. More subtle. Fruity, but drinks like a white wine. Fairly dry, but bubbly.

Very enjoyable and worth the hype. Can’t believe I finally got to try this one."
195,Zach_Attack,Samuel,4.66,"This is mild honeyed sweetness, light lemony, great funky, and super smooth."
196,TooManyGlasses,Abner,4.5,"From brewery - canned October 2/23 - 6 days old.
Uniformly hazy burnt to brownish orange golden colour with a half finger of short lived just slightly off white head.
Nose is floral, some honey like malt; strong citrus notes - orange, red grapefruit - soft tropical fruit (mango mainly) with a hint of vanilla and piney resin. At one point questioned a bit of soapiness.
Sweet citrus on the palate - orange, but also a good whack of pithy grapefruit, some grapefruit peel bitterness coating the back of the mouth admixing with piney resin flavours.
Creamy and smooth, rich full mouthfeel - carbonation brightly pushes throughout the body - pithy bitterness lingers with the juicy sweetness."
197,jimmybram,Abner,4.59,"Such a well balanced beer. Hill Farmstead doesn't go crazy with one flavor profile and that is embodied here. While labeled a NE IPA, is more caramel colored than hazy and tastes blend west coast and east coast styles, similar to Focal Banger. Definitely hoppy at the start but mellows with a malty, oaty finish. Partly hoppy and partly rustic, Abner is a expertly minimalist IPA. They do all the little things right."
198,JayQue,Abner,4.34,"A really great double IPA! Had a pint at The Bench restaurant in Stowe VT. Pours a hazy orange color with a good size white head and good lacing on the glass. Mostly citrus aroma but nicely balanced with hoppy goodness. Mouthfeel is rich, crisp and moderately bitter. An outstanding Double IPA!!"
199,Mortal_Wombat,Double Sunshine,4.76,"Poured into a Spiegelau from a 16 oz can.

Look: Vibrant yellow-orange with a slight amber hue. Rocky, foamy white head with significant lacing. 

Smell: Hop punch up front with juicy, tropical aromas muddling in. Slight vanilla and maple syrup at the end. 

Taste: Hop explosion. Citrus up front with an almost creamy quality, quickly followed by a classic IPA hop bite. 

Feel: Incredibly smooth. A light prickle on the tongue with a creamy mouthfeel and finish.

Overall: A terrific double NEIPA. Truly excellent."
200,Smakawhat,Double Sunshine,4.69,"Poured from the can into a Lawson's branded tulip/goblet glass. Canned April 26th 2023.

Beamin juicy orange colored body, with a touch of haze and light visible carbonation. Three finger forming head, a bit of soapy and big bubbled appearance which pops easily, with light retention. Still manages to stick around and leave a tall collar as well, making a nice crowned appearance.

Delicious aroma. Hop pressing front nose with light citrus, and faint touching juicy tropical notes. A nice creamy touch almost sweet vanilla, mixing with a light caramel and crispy malt quality. Comes off like hinting of light powdered sugar on fruity pancakes quality.

The mouthfeel on this is just unreal. An intense solid backbone that is creamy with just a light touch of pushing sweet tones on the palate. The mid hits with thick THICK controlled orange and pine notes, mixing sweet cream and orange, and pine/earth heat. Bitterness comes in the finish, so ever slowly, with first notes of tangerine and Christmas spices, then with lingering notes of pepper and wood bitterness. Campfire like warmth in the back palate, that just slowly sits and churns with all the orange and spices you can imagine.

Fantastic IPA, and hardly any hint of big abv now that I think of it. Just killer stuff."
201,DMFF,Double Sunshine,4.85,"This stuff is an absolute treat!

L: Pours a deep golden, yet clear in the glass. Fluffy, white head of 3 fingers lasts through the session.

S: Smells of grapefruit, citrus, dank hops, and sweet bread malt.

T: Grapefruit and sweet malt dominates the beginning, the hops come into play by this point and play very nicely with the grapefruit. These dank, citusy notes do not overpower and keep the beer tasting fresh. It finishes clean, especially for a DIPA.

F: Nice level of carbonation, feels smooth and finishes clean. Incredibly drinkable for a session. Just be careful with DIPAs with this level of drinkability.

O: Incredibly well balanced DIPA with an excellent flavor profile. This might be my favorite DIPA I have tried to date."
202,Hobbs87,Double Sunshine,4.02,A little disappointing. Overall a solid IPA but just expected better after having Sips of Sunshine. Surprised at the perfect 100 rating. A more citrusy flavor than Sips with a noticeable grapefruit taste and not as smooth. I’d recommend as a much lighter double IPA for those that don’t prefer the heavy types.
203,DEZ01301960,JJJuliusss,4.52,"Thanks Nick! Vigorous pour produces an amazing smell. Taste follows, juice bomb really tasty. Great medium feel. Overall everything I would expect from this legendary brewery. Touche!"
204,DavetotheB,JJJuliusss,4.32,"From a 16oz can into a tulip. Drank this last night and I forgot to record the canning date. Sometime mid-November 2022. Can message: ""Stay Gold Pony Boy""

Pours an opaque brownish orange with about one finger of white head. Incredible lacing and retention.

Strong aromas of oranges and earth/dirt. 

Taste follows but mellows on warming with a little less distinctness.

Soft, medium to full-bodied mouthfeel. Bitter aftertaste. Medium carbonation.

This beer is excellent-for what it is. Seems to be missing that ""little something extra"" that most of their DIPAs have. That said, if you hand me one of these, I'm gonna drink it. Smiling."
205,Holderness,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,4.52,"2023 vintage. First of all Speedway Stout and its variants are amongst the darkest stouts I've encountered. Due to the barrel aging and higher ABV there is only a deep brown head for a few fleeting moments before it dissipates to nothing. Vietnamese coffee works really well in beer, IMO -- it's rich, nutty, and inviting in the aromas without coming across as syrupy or stale. Also getting strong wet barrel notes, vanilla, coconut, black licorice, cacao powder, and burnt brownie ends. Melted coffee ice cream comes to mind as well. The taste largely follows the nose. There's a lot of the same rich, nutty coffee notes and they are balanced by the intensity of the roasty, herbal base stout and the rye and bourbon notes from the barrel aging. Unlike with the base stout, the mouthfeel leans more oily than velvety. Overall a long time want and this did not disappoint

91/100"

207,BubbleBobble,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,4.12,"Pours near black, ruby-edged, about 1"" tan head with good retention for ABV; very good lacing as well. Nose is vanilla, molasses, dark chocolate, cocoa powder, chicory; as it warms, more wood and bourbon aromas. Taste has leather and tobacco up front, dark chocolate, wood and bourbon spice; sweetened black coffee. Bourbon character masks much of the coffee here, however, along with some of the sweet vanilla notes I recall from the non-BBA version. Mouthfeel is moderate with low carb, nowhere near as thick as and chewy as other contemporary stouts at this ABV. A good beer, but definitely prefer the non-BBA version."
208,mfnmbvp,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,4.15,"12 fl oz. bottle, 2022 vintage.

A: Pours black & opaque. Small gathering of tan bubbles that doesn't stay long. Inky. It's got 'legs' for sure.
S: Smooth, oaky, buttery. Notes of chocolate / vanilla come forth more as it approaches room temp. Coffee is nil.
T: Boozy, warm, roasty. Again, body is creamy, but flavors of actual coffee bean or roastiness are pretty absent.. Still, it is chocolatey, boozy, and decadent tasting. A dessert beer for sure.
F: Smooth & creamy. Thick & heavy. Boozy, full. Alcohol warmth. 

Overall, nice, but I'm not terribly blown away or anything, was definitely expecting more pronounced coffee flavors from this. 4.25 overall is a generous rating in my opinion.

Flavors of coffee, dark roast malt, bourbon, oak, vanilla as it warms, light chocolate, a little malted milk balls. Has a decent amount of malt/hop bitterness. Smooth, a solid, full body, appropriately carbonated.

Lots of delicious coffee on top of the always solid base is a winning combination. The barrels are light, but effective. Hope this comes around again."

213,Holderness,Framboise Du Fermier,4.33,"Interesting plum-hued body with a bit of haze and a sudsy off-white head produced with moderate pour. Overripe raspberry billows out of the glass, with additional aromatics of fruit leather, champagne, and wildflowers. Very lovely although not particularly complex. Flavors lean tart, as per usual with SP, although the intense raspberry really helps balance things out here. Kinda like eating a raspberry with a lot of seeds, resulting in a more tart, tannic character. Feel is light, astringent and puckering. Overall pretty decent, reminds me of Drie Fonteinen's Framboos (and at a similar price point, $50/750ml)

87/100"
214,UrbanCaveman,Framboise Du Fermier,4.45,"750 ml bottle, poured into a New Glarus glass at ~40 degrees F.

S: The nose is all tart raspberries, with some soft oak tannins wafting in the backdrop. 

T: Sharp, tart, sour raspberries, with just a slight tang beneath of oak.

F: Light, and not terribly lively.

O: Definitely framboise to the core, with a du Fermier acidity."

219,TooManyGlasses,Dinner,4.8,"10 ounce pour at the taproom in Freeport, Maine.
Slightly hazy bright orange golden pour with a finger and a half of uniform tight white head.
Aroma is absolutely killer - tropical fruit - pineapple, ripe orange, orange peel, piney and a bit sweaty. Just a little bit herbal with a whiff of green onion.
Sweet upfront with the pineapple, ripe orange, and tangerine but with a decent blast of piney and resinous hops and an herbal bitterness at back - perfect balance of fruity sweetness and pungent bitterness.
Medium full mouthfeel with bright carbonation - goes down with a sticky bittersweetness that lingers nicely.
Fantastic."
220,DefenCorps,Dinner,4.53,"Thanks, Chris 

A mildly hazy light orange with a dense, white head with excellent retention and lacing. The nose is gloriously hoppy, pungent, fruity, pine, dank, melon, grape, orange, mandarin. A true riot of hops. The palate opens clean, fruity, bitter, pungent and oily. Grapefruit, mandarin, citrus zest, melon, grape, mild peach. There's a softness to the palate that really accentuates the hops. A light sweetness. Soft, creamy finish with lingering hop oils. Fabulous."
221,BubalooBrewMaster,Dinner,3.93,It was a great beer. Overall it was a good change from the OJ bombs...
222,Smakawhat,Dinner,4.51,"Poured on tap a snifter at Churchkey DC.

Beaming pale gold, with hints of orange color, and some fine carbonation. Soft creamy top of finger presented, with an off white appearance and bowled tilted lacing.

Aroma is a wonderful spiced orange. Juiced Christmas mandarin nose, with hints of spice and leafy green sensing hops. Soft bodied and creamy vanilla sensing malt to match make an impressive hop nose.

Palate is richly good, but no surprises. Creamy sensing body along with the flavors, if anything its mouthfeel is the most impressive. Mid palate rich in peeled and juiced orange tangerine notes. Finish accentuates soft green herbs, to an almost minty finish but a more pungent flavor, and sharper astringency like a soft pine. Still manages great balance keeping soft vanilla like flavored sweetness, and that classic Creamsicle orange like flavor.

It's not that exotic or dynamic, just a solid ipa done with exceptional base flavors. Very nice!"

Appearance: Pours a cloudy apricot with a one finger head that leaves some streaky lacing as it reduces to a film

Smell: Tart lemon, green apple, white wine grape and oak, layered with some barnyard funk

Taste: Tart lemon forward with white wine grape and green apple rounding out the lactic parade; oak and barnyard funk, through the middle, with a sour yogurt finish

Mouthfeel: Light to medium body with moderate carbonation; puckery

Overall: Long time want and glad to finally get a chance to taste this; lives up to its billing"
225,REVZEB,Duck Duck Gooze,4.55,"At long last! It was always scandalous to me that the top rated gueuze on this site was from outside belgium, and while I still feel this is not the best gueuze I have ever had, I can now see why it is in that echelon of the style. Cloudy yellow pour, finger of sudsy white foam, good mix of spotted and splotchy lacing. Lemon, sliced tart apple, lacto, barnyard funk, white grape, flowers, hay and earthy oak in the potent nose. Taste is just as potent, but not as complex as the sour notes lead more than the barnyard funk, oak backs the sour fruits well, slight earth, yogurt funk, and decent hay round out. A more sunny disposition for the style, leans sour more than funky but both present in spades, but the body is light and nuanced despite the potency. I would love to age a bottle of this as I think it would age really nicely!"
226,WickedBeer,Duck Duck Gooze,4.65,"2022 Vintage. Side-by-side with Mother of All Gooze Anniversary Blend.

Hazy golden yellow coloration. Gusher on the pop, frothy white carb. 

Nose is sweet, tart, funky. Notes of underripe peach, lemon zest, and bright, musty funk. 

Palate tart and full of stone fruit flavors. Medium acid and a touch of minerality. You can tell the youth on this, whereas on MOAG you really can tell the age on the blend."
227,Roy_Hobbs,Duck Duck Gooze,4.47,"Received from @dimidiata. Pours a bright golden color with a small amount of short-lived white head that receded to a thin ring. Fully translucent, almost clear. Aroma has tons of funk, well complemented by complex wine and barrel noted. along with lemon & dandelion. Overall a wonderful smelling beer. 

Taste picks up right where the nose left off. I get apricots, wine barrel, apple vinegar, lemon, hay and general barnyard funk. Acidity is spot on. Tart, but it doesn't beat you over the head, allowing all the other wonderful flavors their time in the spotlight. Light bodied, bright, crisp and clean. 

Overall, an absolutely wonderful beer."

Reviewed: 24 December 2023

A: Pours a crystal clear deep, dark ruby with a large dark pink head that dissipates quickly until it looks almost still. When the head dissipates it almost looks like a medium body red wine in color, like a pinot noir or chianti. 4.5

S: Aroma is lovely with very strong dark berry notes and substantial plastic like funk. There is a huge bing cherry character, balancing notable citrus sourness. 4.75

T: Taste is very sour, probably the most puckering sourness I’ve ever experienced in a beer. Outright impressive. These sour notes are balanced by a very nice red fruit palate bouquet, lead by of course cherry characteristics. There is a big clean minerality and some smoothly oaky notes. Essentially perfect. 5

M/D: Lighter side of medium bodied with a nice bright, crispy carbonation, and a great drinkability. 4.75

229,stevoj,Lou Pepe - Kriek,4.93,"750ml bottle at share. Cranberry pour, wispy off-white head. Tart cherry aroma. Taste starts with a big pucker, lots of sour cherries, fruity, wine-like. So rich, so full. Definitely worthy of it's high rating. Honored to get to finally try this."
230,Sabtos,Lou Pepe - Kriek,4.94,"Seeing the tape get pulled off the menu listing for the 2020 bottle at the Cantillon bar definitely got the old heart pumping. As the freshly, horizontally uncorked bottle rested in its lambic basket, it began to slowly push a soft mauve foam out of the spout before I gave it a tilt to pour a damn near smoothie-like stream into the glass. There it displays fully opaque garnet with a dense cotton candy head.

I said St. Lam was the juiciest Loon? Scratch that, this is like Schaerbeek puree with mild hints of cinnamon marzipan delivered on a pillowy body with a surprisingly balanced acidity. Even still, a complex oak tannin brings us to a bone dry finish before exhaling a touch of black pepper and perhaps chevre. A delicious candied quality further emerges as it warms.

I'm not sure I ever imagined just what made LPK the highly coveted fruited lambic that it is, but clearly, that distinguisher is decadence. This is undoubtedly the thickest lambic I've ever had, and in all the most delicious ways."
231,Harrison8,Lou Pepe - Kriek,4.64,"Cradled 750mL bottle served in decanter, sat for ~20 minutes, then served into glass. Pours a rich burgundy color with a finger of pink foam. Aroma is cherry forward, but not in a fleshy, fruit forward way, instead delivering a rindy dark pit. It's morphs into notes of almond and cinnamon, with light tart cherry and stone just beyond. Complexity is notable, without any overtly sugary tendencies. Flavor profile delivers those same almond and cinnamon notes. Cherry is present, with a tart twist. Stone, followed by big lemon zest and grassy notes play the outro. Again, the complexity and depth is just amazing. For a beer blended with cherries, it develops much more nuance and thought beyond this single note. Mouth feel is medium in thickness with a consistent grit throughout. It verges on bubbly, at least at the onset. Overall, cherry notes here are just a delight, swirling together with almond and cinnamon for a thought provoking sip. It refrains from every dipping into overtly tart or sour.

Beer 1400!!! I purposely saved this one for this landmark review since I reviewed the base version and the imperial version a few weeks back. This has been a long time want of mine, and luckily I was able to get the whole series at once. This bourbon barrel-aged variant has been sitting at the highest rated Imperial Porter for a long time on BA, and #38 overall. Let’s see if it lives up to the hype

Pours a very dark brown with a finger of creamy dark tan head that fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing

The bourbon is definitely present in the nose, making the whole thing quite a bit sweeter but still really good. I’m picking up on aromas of sweet bourbon, charred oak, salty bacon, medium roast coffee, milk chocolate, maple syrup, burnt caramel, and light brown sugar

It’s an absolute smack in the face of every single element in taste, wow. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting smoky bacon, milk chocolate, maple candy, sweetened coffee, sweet bourbon, raisin, toasted oak, creamy vanilla, and caramel. The swallow brings notes of salty bacon, charred oak, dark chocolate, medium roast coffee, burnt caramel, brown sugar, maple syrup, smoked malt, and vanilla

A medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a smooth and silky beer. Finishes mostly dry with a warming alcohol presence

Man, it’s been so much fun trying my way through this series. This one is the clear winner. I hope I get a chance to try them all fresh one day"
234,4DAloveofSTOUT,Morning Wood,4.59,"22oz bomber bottle. most likely a 2019 bomber based on the listed abv of 11% on the bottle, but was told this was a 2018 vintage of Morning Wood.

Poured into Durobar Charente glass.

Appearance: black bodied beer with dense and thick off white to light brown head that is uneven with lots of large soapy looking bubbles. Light lacing. good staying power. Thick ring remains around the outside of the glass as the head eventually dies down. 

Smell: Big maple and oatmeal with a hint of cinnamon, smokey bacon and a hint of coffee. Hints of chocolate, oak, and bourbon.

Taste: Immediately big maple syrup flavored oatmeal just like what was found in the nose. Bacon and meaty smoke integrated nicely with a gentle ashy barrel char in the middle that is quite enjoyable. Hint of Dad's brand root beer candies and cola. Finish has lots of rich bourbon notes and chocolate notes. This is complex, superbly balanced, and flat out really really tasty. Easily exceeds my expectations for sure.

Mouthfeel: medium bodied beer with low and adequate carbonation levels. Slightly silky and creamy bodied porter. Very smooth and not any booze at all. 

Overall: Finally! Pretty excited to get to tick this barrel aged porter thanks to TATURBO. This beer is rich without being overly sweet. The barrel notes are spot on and it really is hard to find anything wrong in this beer. Just the right amount of maple which is a flavor that is easy to overdo. The balance is also quite impressive as well. Put this beer on your must try list if you haven't. Breakfast flavors galore with a splash of bourbon and oak. What's not to like? The barrel aging definitely improves maple bacon coffee porter which is a hard feat to achieve. Nice work here from Funky Buddha for sure."
235,FBarber,Morning Wood,4.53,"Damn, the minute I opened this I was punched in the face with maple - it is clear that age has not diminished the maple presence at all ... In terms of appearance it pours a shiny black color. A lovely velvety head forms on the beer with solid head retention. It is pretty viscous. Back to the aroma - it is dominated by the maple syrup with underlying notes of smoky bacon, oak, bourbon, and chocolate. All of those aromas are quite strong - so I am not really getting much in the way of coffee.

Taste follows the nose and is very much dominated by the maple syrup flavor, but the surprising part is that it is not at all as sweet as I remember from having this in the past. There is much more roasted malt, chocolate, smoked malts with some slight meaty notes, and the bourbon barrel comes through more strongly. Some slight roasty bitterness comes through on the back end. Feel is thick, full bodied and luscious. Moderate carbonation. Sort of drier on the finish."
236,edthehead,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout - Double Barrel Reserve,5,"Dark brown/black oily appearance, very little head that recedes quickly to a collar, and oily fingers. Roasted coffee, natural maple, and smooth bourbon barrel notes, all so integrated and well balanced. Moderate thick body, mild to moderate carbonation, smooth textured mouthfeel. Well done build on regular KBBS."
237,SadMachine,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout - Double Barrel Reserve,4.82,"Officially my final beer of the top 250 list!

Pours mostly black, with a slight brown edges. Essentially no head, but beautiful legs coat the glass!

The aroma explodes with huge notes of maple in the forefront! Bourbon soaked coffee beans follow in a big way! Just massive waves of toasted oak, sweet caramel, and hints of coconut. The barrel notes are tremendous, and the adjuncts fill in beautifully!

The taste does not disappoint! It follows all of the notes from the nose almost to a T! Extremely maple forward, but the bourbon and coffee cut the sweetness beautifully! Touches of burnt oak and coconut balance things out well. A slight bitterness from the coffee was a pleasant surprise.Delightful!

Medium bodied, yet nicely mouth coating. Incredibly smooth and round, with only a touch of booze. A surprisingly dry finish that keeps you coming back for more.

This beer was tremendous, and I'm so happy I got to have this as my final beer on the top 250 list! While I didn't rate the taste and feel quite so high I don't know what I'd change in this beer, so I'm giving the overall a 5!"

L: Beautiful reddish brown color

S: Such a subtle sweet smell. A bit of apples, but not your regular cider like apples. A bit of burnt sugar in smell.

T is as great as smell. Very gentle, sweet, deep, and dry at the same time. Like a great jerez. 

F: Very easy to drink for the amount of alcohol. Aftertaste of a cola lollipop, very pleasant.

O: Probably the best beer I tried. Unique. Now I see why it has 100/100. After hesitation, I ordered it in Hops and dreams in Seville to celebrate my marathon pb. A perfect end to a fantastic day."
240,beergoot,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),4.61,"Clear and yet very dark brown body, opaque in the glass; head pours out fizzy but stabilizes to nice 1 1/2 finger thick head, light khaki colored. Fantastic aroma of brown and candi sugars; brownies; roasted nuts; mildly perky spiciness augments all the other smells. Stupendous flavors; deep caramel and nougat notes; honey; brown sugar; a bit of boozy undertone; no real bitterness per se, more of a phenol bite.

I never expected to have this beer, yet here it is. The depth and complexity is outstanding. More tones and nuances emerge as the beer warms up such as roasted nuts and chocolate. This is a truly outstanding beer based solely on the taste, a masterful bit of brewing art.

241,HorseheadsHophead,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),4.21,"Gushed a bit when I got opened the bottle. I hope the carb is intact.

It's a murky dark brown color, bordering on black at its darkest point, but the highlights are a lighter shade brown rather than ruby. It's like the color of banana bread crust.
Not much visible carbonation in the glass. The head is small, beige, creamy, and patchy. The head doesn't seem to dissipate at all; it was just never that big to begin with. But it's sticky, latte-like froth, and swirly.
Upon further swirls, it generates a larger head that stays.

Alcohol tickles my nostrils immediately with warmth. Prune and fig stands out, dried cherry and raisin, allspice, clove, and hay. A bit of overripe banana, banana bread, some type of woodsy bark, perhaps oak and tannins. Gives off red wine vibes. Upon another whiff and thought, huge tobacco aroma, with perhaps a touch of vanilla. There's some sweet caramel and toffee or butterscotch that melds seamlessly with dark brown bread and banana. Think of it as dried and musty stone fruit trail mix in a cigar humidor with baking supplies. It smells like it's from a cellar. Amazing. Perhaps it's the power of suggestion, but it smells like it came from a monastery.

The taste is more subdued than the nose. Interesting. It tastes very strong and almost boozy. It tastes like bourbon soaked raisin, banana bread, some prune, and large amounts of clove and pepper. Some hay and oak tannins. The alcohol warmth takes over the palate and lingers with heat.

The mouthfeel is smooth, silky, creamy. It coats the palate. The carbonation isn't extremely high compared to other Belgians, but it moves the beer on the palate nonetheless. The palate is left feeling sticky with some residuals sugar and ethanol, though not overly so. It's not cloying at all. Dries off quite a bit. The alcohol taste lingers.

Overall? Well, of course, I'm grateful to have ever tried this. This was my number one whale. So my prejudice preceded me. It is very good, but arguably, not any better than some of the other widely available quads. In fact, I'd say some of them are equal or better. But this is still great, and what an experience!"
242,Ushouldbeworkinh,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),4.57,"Dark brown quad colour, but clear, no haze. Very nice tight darker than white head. Smell is malty, caramel and spice, with a little something I can't quite name. Taste is the same with a smooth feel even though the beer retains head very well. Very nice, though unsurprisingly not quite worth the hype."
243,Luscious_Malfoy,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),4.71,poured from a 330mL bottle into a st bernardus oversized wine / belgian glass. medium brown with light brown edges and a huge light khaki colored foam head. huge esters / phenols on the nose with some rye and caramel. taste follows. barely any hint of the abv until it finally hit room temp. really smooth and good. lots of rye spice to my tastebuds. thick mouthfeel. slick and making it all the easier drinking. this was great. long-time want for me and it delivered big time.
244,vinicole,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),4.06,"Bottle. Cellared for seven years. Dark ruby\amber. Floaters present and vigouressly effervescent allowing them to dance around. Thin, dense, light brown head.
Rich aroma of malt, dark fruits and booze.
Tastes of lightly caramelised brown sugar along with spiced fruits. A mild bitter finish balances the sweetness.
Has a lightly carbonated feel. Medium to full bodied.
Very good and highly drinkable but for me a tad overrated."
245,beerwithmeIRL,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),4.93,"330ml bottle - Pours a chestnut brown with a 2 finger head that gradually dissipates but it has to be said good retention & lacing. Beautiful sweet nose, filled with malts and dried dark fruits. Tastes absolutely incredible, the notes detected by the nose are cranked up to 11 and linger in a complex & flavoursom whirlwind. Such malty and sweet goodness. Honestly, an absolutely amazing beer. Perhaps the best quad around. I always though that it was potentially over-rated due to the mystique surrounding it and the relative scarcity of it, but no... it is astonishing. Unfortunately, it's so damn hard to get!"
246,MikeWard,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),4.44,"330ml bottle into a chalice. Gift from a friend after recent trip to the brewer.

Looks magnificent. Dark brown body with amber touches. Generous off white head continues throughout leaving a solid sheet of lacing. Malty aroma with some dark fruit notes. On tasting, malty, more dark fruit, fairly sweet. The finish is a progression of dark fruit, sweet, and a light bitter note. Nicely warming in the throat. Masterful brewing."
247,Steve_F,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),5,"A few years ago I had arranged to buy a few bottles off the gray market, but sadly the deal fell through. However, this year I had my chance when we vacationed in Antwerp. So I made the 2 hour drive to Westvleteren and located In de Vrede across from the Abbey. We had lunch, sampled a glass of 12 and the Blonde. Both were fabulous, but the 12 by far is at the top. Not only did it live up to my expectations it was the finest Trappist Ale I have ever tried. I picked up a couple of 6-packs to bring home to the US to enjoy over the next few months. 

The aroma after the pour is slightly nutty. The beer is very smooth, has a great flavor without the strong alcohol feel as with many other Belgian beers. It is by far the most satisfying beers I have tasted."
248,TheMadJack,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),4.41,"Purchased a 2023 bottling in 2023. Poured at cellar temperature into a wine glass as my goblet did not survive a move.

Vigorous head on pour half filled my glass with fluffy, off-white foam like a well-made cappuccino. Excellent retention and it took a long time to settle enough to pour a proper glass. Beer is a ruddy brown with tawny highlights. Some haze and fine carbonation.

Immediate malt on opening, like walking into a bakery. Warm, whole grain type bread. Putting my nose into the glass, my impression is of balance. It's subtle and difficult to pull out specific notes, but I get cherry, a bit of almond, orange peel, and a light mineral aspect. The expected regional notes of banana and clove are present but subdued

Taste is the expected clove and banana, plus brown sugar, cardamom, cream. Back notes of coffee beans and mineral water.

Mouthfeel starts out with a Sprite-like effervescence calming to a velvety, creamy texture from the head.

Drinkability? Yeah, it's drinkable. If you can get ahold of enough of it to have a session, sure, you could do it. But after only one bottle I can already tell I'm starting to miss subtleties that I picked up at the beginning. Much more affordable beers to tie one off with. But for any Beer Advocate, this is a bucket list item worth checking off the list."
249,GormBrewhouse,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),4.88,"Pours dark amber into a snifter. Very thin and white head which mostly disappears with a slight film left throughout the consumption.
Smell is complex, fruits spice a bit of malt combine for a wonderful aroma. Slight alcohol vapor helps bring the scents up and out into the air.
Mouth feel ,again, complex. 10.2 abv is there ,but no alcohol burn . Smooth with the spice and fruit finishing without very little aftertaste. Overall a truly world class beer."

254,SpeedwayJim,The Adjunct Trail - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.57,"750ml waxed and capped bottle into a BBT snifter. 

Pours pitch black, rich, and dense. Huge, dark mocha colored legs. No head, no lace. Nose is mocha, chocolate, hazelnut, and slight overtones of barrel. Just as advertised and amazingly rich. Beer opens rich milk chocolate, hazelnut, and mocha coffee. Layers of molasses, vanilla, and lactose in the middle. More chocolate, hazelnut, and pancake syrup in the back. The barrel character has mellowed out significantly at this point but the adjunct flavors are still bright as day. Somehow not overly sweet given the flavor combination. Long, lingering finish and aftertaste. Body is spot on. Rich, thick, and chewy. Coats the palate. Long, lingering, boozy aftertaste. 

This beer is impressive. Really nice balance in the flavor. I don't know that I want too much barrel so as to not drown out the other flavors here. Definitely worth trying."
255,Holderness,Maman,4.55,"2023 vintage.

Reminds me of a ""Beer:Barrel:Time Light"". Has that same deep syrupy black appearance, the same expressive aromas of nougat, marzipan, brownie batter, vanilla, marshmallow, coconut, and bourbon barrel, the same sweet but not cloying milke chocolate/nougat/espresso/marshmallow flavors, and the same viscous mouthfeel. Just everything is a bit lighter, which is not necessarily a bad thing. Overall fantastic all around, glad to finally be checking off this long time want. I feel like this one has held up to the test of time. Like with BBT, can't believe this has no adjuncts... 

91/100"
256,Zaximus,Maman,4.07,2023
257,Harrison8,Maman,4.43,"Pours jet black with a still, no foam look. Heavy oily legs cling to the glass after the lightest of swirls. It looks like motor oil that's been run hard through a motor for ten thousand miles - thick, dark, and viscous. Aroma pushes dark fruits, plum, and chocolate across the nose first. Char, barrel, bourbon, and hearty roasty and toasty malts sit behind. Dark fruits is the dominate note, at least, immediately out of the fridge. Mild brownie shows up as the beer warms. Flavor profile is dark fruits, caramel, toffee, tobacco, raisins, fig, plum, and chocolate. The blend of notes conjours up thoughts of barleywines, but retains heavy stout notes via late roasty and toasty malts. Bourbon, barrel, and char are all present to varying degrees, molding into the 14.6% ABV well. Brownie and more chocolate start to show up as the beer warms, masking some of hte initial dark fruit notes. It really develops a wonderful depth to the flavor profile after a fairly simplistic aroma. Mouth feel is thick and viscious, but with an otherwise flat and still effervescence. Overall, a blend of hearty stout and barleywine notes. It has a lot of dark fruits for a heavy stout, but despite that, retains a good balance despite being in wine alcohol territory. Massive slug, so -0.25 from overall.

260,GreesyFizeek,Ann,4.84,"2015 batch, which I think is batch #3. Bottle pour from Hill Farmstead Brewery in Greensboro, VT.

This one pours a fairly clear golden orange color, with a small head, and a bit of lacing.

This smells like lemon peel, tea, honey, grassy funk, white wine, pear skin, melon, Riesling, and a minerally funk.

This is my biggest white whale, the beer I have most wanted to try since first trying Hill Farmstead originally 10 years ago. It’s tremendous, just about as good as it gets for saison, but, it wasn’t even the best beer I had from Hill Farmstead on my recent trip. That’s how high the bar is for this long-time favorite brewery of mine. This has soft, subtle, and richly complex flavor to it. There’s the obvious honey, almost like honey-soaked pears, or something like that, with white wine, Riesling grapes, melon, apricot jam, and a floral and minerally funk. All of these flavor descriptions make it seem like it’s a super strong and intense beer – it really isn’t. It’s really delicate, and rewards slower sipping and enjoying.

This is light bodied, soft, almost creamy, with a wonderful drinkability. It’s well carbonated, but in a subtle way.

This might not be the exact top of the mountain for Hill Farmstead – that’s probably Samuel, or one of the SARA Residency beers. But this is pretty close to the top, and a perfect expression of an already great beer in Anna."

262,Smakawhat,Doubleganger,4.41,"Poured from the can into a Spiegelau IPA glass. Double your fun 12/07/2023.

Peach orange with lemon and muted chestnut brown highlights. Not quite turbid, but a solid opaque color with some variations and a bit of mild shine as well. Creamed white three to four finger high tall head, with crowning and clinking thick lace.

Beating hop aroma, pungent with dank sweetness that hits with excellent smokey tones. Sweet wood and touches of faint hinting juiced fruit. Weed like with gummy fruit sensations hiding slightly.

Very enjoyable palate. Mid rush of juiced fruit, and more so of ju jube candies, soft and chewy with a pliable dense mouthfeel. Gummy fruit mixing with earth and dank flavors particularly on the finish. Excellent mild astringency and that slowly builds with nice hop warmth and herbs.

Unexpected palate, was expecting more of an earthy explosion, but the candy gummy fruit flavor on this is a real treat with the dank delicious mix."

271,REVZEB,Fuzzy,4.55,"I'm finding I am really enjoying white peaches specifically in wild ales, just lend themselves to barrel, funk and botanicals so well. Here SP has done well to allowing the juicy peach tones shine too. Smell is damn impressive: sour peach, yogurt, barnyard, and barrel funks, bright and rustic oak, pressed flowers, dry earth, a touch of lemon and lime zest, and finished with big hay. Taste is more sour and less complex with funk losing the barrel variety to the sour fruits, otherwise the same with sneaky complexity yet potent. Feel is sour and decently acidic, but gentle, dries out with various funks, almost feels more pungent than it tastes or smells. Clear yellow body with a pinky finger of white foam. This is right up there with the best peach wild ales, little less acidity and it could be the very top"
272,Rug,Fuzzy,4.49,"2022 vintage

Here we are, the #1 Wild Ale on BA for my 1500th review! This is a special one that has been a long time want for me, so I’m very excited to finally try it. I’ve only had a few Side Project beers, but they’ve all been fantastic so I have no reason to think this one wouldn’t be. Let’s get into it

Pours a cloudy pale gold with 2 fingers of whitehead that quickly fades to a ring and leaves no lacing

This is certainly tart in the nose, but it has a surprisingly nice balance to it. I'm picking up on aromas of tart peach, lemon yogurt, sharp oak, tannic white wine, straw, bready malt, wildflower honey, apple skin, light vinegar, stone, and even a touch of smoke

In taste it starts off with a balanced tartness similar to the aroma, and on the back end explodes with an aggressive flash of tartness before settling down once again. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting jammy peach, lemon juice, vanilla, wet hay, straw, smooth oak, leather, and white grape. The swallow brings notes of tart peach, lemon juice, crabapple, white wine vinegar, sharp oak, wet hay, vanilla, bready malt, and light peat smoke

A medium body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a puckering beer. Finishes a tad sticky but dries out over time

Oh yeah, this is damn good. Despite the not so good looks, everything else here is awesome. A truly unique beer"
273,JohnnyHopps,Fuzzy,4.42,"Appearance - The beer was the color of a peach. It was orange with red hues toward the center. 

Smell - The beer smelled like sour peaches. There was an undercurrent of sweetness, like vanilla. 

Taste - The profile was quite acidic, like a soured peach. Notes of peach and peach skin were detected. There seemed of be the presence of vanilla sweetness as well. The profile had a nice sour peach finish. 

Mouthfeel - The body had little carbonation, but a pleasant smoothness. 

Overall - This is a sour that I can enjoy, and I am not a sour guy."
274,elNopalero,Fuzzy,4.57,"This was a guest beer on tap during the 2021 Zwanze Day celebration I attended.
2020 Fuzzy, at a year’s age.

Loved the nose on this. Stone fruit in season, white peach and a hint of funk. It’s tart, without being overly sour, with a nuanced finish. More of the peach notes, leaving the palate tingling. Fantastic."
275,M-Fox24,Fuzzy,4.15,"A: Tangerine pour with fiery hues to apricot. The neck films a shade of macaroon cream that’s dismissive per inscription, from the preset retention. Howbeit, an irksomeness to turns offers lace docility, as the intervals thermally protract. There’s a touch of transparency upon the settlements of course, while effervescence becomes a mobilized variance 

S: Pierced rusticity for white peach with esterification authorities. Illustrated by, a bitingly tart eruption that’s tamed enough for the developing – wild yeast – appearances. The progression opts for some grainy malt to the motivated horsed phenols, which quietly idle funk steps. Principally, satchels and farmstalls with soiled mold. Nonetheless, acidity is tenacious on fruit bouquets, as the lactic stability is detrimental to frowzy quirks. There’s elements of solvency thru the open air drafts, which incriminate nail polish and naphtha agents. On the other hand, that piece is often stupefied, given the peppery phenol attunement to floral hops, and biscuit-y malt brackets to stone fruit minerals

T: A clean, consecutive, punch-down stomp that puts natural peaches in vanguard. Notations subtly follow in ripening depictions of Goldrich apricots and Armking nectarines, while briny minerals perimeter Neptune grass. In correlation, an engine for Eugenol to promptly pump in cloves and nutmeg, while maintaining that peppery attenuation. The ongoing drive is earthy and persistently bright, with calming acidity on the advances of rural funk. To that end, the move adds haystacks atop the citrus connotations, but keeps that musty jazz in a distant place. Aerial attacks begin setting in, from oak dragged elasticities, and prompt in some leathery satchels. Whilst, Chardonnay attenuates a staleness for Budapestlängd with an oxidative nuttiness

M: Does not puncture with puckered acridity, but rather maintains a level of energy that rationally aids. Namely, a backend for rustic brettanomyces, and a pillar for biscuit-y grains. The approach is brisk in carbonation, as the approach is crisp in sensation. Thus, cleanly bright with minor overextensions in the presetting bites, but pleasingly uplifting in the dry – erosional – reliefs

O: Showcases clean peach natures with a caustic effervescence that’s costly to the preliminary entwines, of wild yeast. Though, development is rapid enough to calm the impaling authorities, and make rational moves. In this situation, light malts provide an aid to earthy hop kicks, while acclimating spiced esters with musty phenols. The approach is thereby tart with brett funk complexions, and spurs wooded fruit tannins on an astutely dry/crisp exhibition"

Alright folks, here we are, the final BIF beer I received from @Eziel! It’s been a wild 6 months of hard to find beers, and we’re ending with the heaviest hitter of the bunch. This is currently the 5th highest rated Saison on BA and 52nd overall. Those are some impressive stats. Also, I’m not sure if I’ve ever seen a beer fruited with only nectarine, it’s usually a blend. Let’s get into it

Pours an opaque orange gold with 2 fingers of creamy off white head that very quickly fizzes away to nothing and leaves no lacing

Sheesh, less than stellar appearance aside, this is bold in the nose, just super fruity and tart with a big funk too. I'm picking up on aromas of sweet nectarine, wet hay, tart apricot, sharp oak, lemon yogurt, wildflower honey, straw, and crackery malt

Oh man, the funk is even punchier in taste, but not in a way that's out of balance. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting tart peach, lemon juice, white wine vinegar, stone, sharp oak, nectarine, wet hay, honey, and lemongrass. The swallow brings notes of wet hay, stone, white wine vinegar, peach pit, nectarine, sharp oak, crackery malt, lemon yogurt, and light orange juice

A medium body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a sharp and zippy beer. Finishes bone dry with a lovely balance of sour fruit and funk

Appearance: Pours a completely dark black color with a moderate black head that fades. (4.00)

Aroma: Strong aromas of bourbon mixed with some chocolate and dark malts. (4.00) 

Flavor: Strong and rich flavors of bourbon upfront. A little hot. Then it fades into chocolate and some complex dark malt flaovrs including bread, strudel, maple syrup, caramel, and toffee. Smooth but sweet and more bourbon off the end. (4.00) 

Feel: Heavier-bodied, average to lower carbonation. Rich, sweet, shows the bourbon and a bit hot. (4.00)

Overall: Heavy on the bourbon as expected. Evolves into complex malt flavors of chocolate, caramel, toffee, and maple syrup. Less carbonation than I expect and it drinks heavy, sweet, and a bit hot showing the booze a bit. I'm sort of getting the hang of and appreciating BBA stouts, but these 14%+ ones are on a different level that my palate has still not quite primed for. I'm sure it's a World-Class beer, but all I'm getting is a lot of bourbon, booze, and sweetness. It's good, big and a sipper. (Rating: 4.00)"

290,doclh,Bourbon County Brand Stout,5,"This beer is my all time favorite. It has made many beers that I used to love take a much lower place on my want list. It is thick, black, savory, opulent, and above all incredibly flavorful. The poor is light on the head. I look at it as less waste to the heavens. I really feel that the thick, viscous strands of fluid on my glass are pulling the foam back into the glass. This allows me to enjoy more of it in my glass. The nose is sweet and rich. The initial taste grabs the tongue and lets you know something really good is coming. The thick viscosity makes me feel it is worth the price. Full bodied flavors of Rum, bourbon, hops, and malt fill the palate. The finish is long. Often five to ten minutes after the last sip. I cannot wait for my next one!"
291,nizzle8287,Bourbon County Brand Stout,4.02,"Over-hyped much? Yes, I believe so... 2022 bottle poured into a snifter, as recommended, at around 50F. 
Almost no head, even upon pouring fairly hard, and it disappears into about a BB-sized patch that does percolate up from the bottom of the snifter... Black as a moonless night.
Smell is bourbon, vanilla.
Taste is bourbon, vanilla, a little cocoa, and a smidge of toffee, but the label says ""dried fruit"" which I fail to recognize. maybe it was the year of rest, or maybe it is the bourbon that overshadows all of the minor flavors... Overall very sweet and cloying. 
Perhaps this is where other drinkers give this brew all the credit: Mouthfeel. At 14.3% abv, you'd think this would be unbearable to drink, but it's actually not too bad. Far smoother than Tupps Full Grown Man, with less alcohol presence than one might imagine. Slightly sticky mouthfeel, however my tastes are developing into enjoying much dryer brews, so it just doesn't get the points from me like most others on here give it. 
Overall, I have one more 2022 bottle to drink, and I think I'll wait until 2025 to drink it, but I'm not itching to open another bottle of this. Wasn't too impressed, but I'm just not very impressed by cloyingly sweet bourbon anything, so don't take this too personally, but I won't buy this again."
292,JLaw55,Bourbon County Brand Stout,4.75,"Drinking a 2019 vintage, aged for 4 years and drank in 1/1/23. Super smooth, incredibly so. Dark black, almost no head, slightest little lacing around the edges. Rich and indulgent, like a smoother and thinner chocolate syrup flavor and profile. Notes of toffee, vanilla, walnuts, and burnt oak round out the sweet richness of the chocolate. Stunning."
293,MutuelsMark,Bourbon County Brand Stout,4.5,"Dark as can be. Head was tan and tight, did fade fairly quickly. Nose was bourbon and chocolate and coffee. Taste was same as note, with some nutty flavors, maybe pecan or walnut? Surprisingly smooth given the high ABV. very good beer, however as with many hard to find beer, doesn't meet the hype...close though."
294,BigBarley,Bourbon County Brand Stout,4.88,"Smell is incredible, very thick with almost non-existent head, just a light brown ring of bubbles that comes alive as the beer collects, and retreats into a thin cap.
Not as thick as it looks as far as feel, but very powerful stout all the same. Great cycle of flavors as you sip, ranging from dark cherry with a touch of subtle vanilla, to a roasted coffee, and always that sweet chocolatey presence behind it all that's so common in sweeter, American stouts. Little hint of licorice the further you go, and despite the big ABV, the booze presence is very tangled with that vanilla underbelly, never becoming a harsh, sharp thing, only ever working with the sweet, dark flavors. One of a kind experience, recommended wholeheartedly."
295,Broman,Parabola,4.74,"Poured from a bottle. 2023 vintage.


Appearance - Body is black as the night with a dark brown short head that disappears into some wispy bubbles. The dark brown head was expected and didn’t disappoint.

Smell - Malty and molasses, chocolatey and some boozy bourbon hints. Not overpowering but pleasant.

Taste -Malty right away. Some coffee tones and darker fruits. Smooth chocolate finish with some mild hints of booze. Great taste and pleasantly surprised by the subdued alcohol boozy presence throughout the sampling. Very rich beer.

Feel -Lower carbonation, minimal boozy sting and a lighter body than expected. 

Overall - Great beer that I feel privileged to try. I couldn’t drink many of these in one sitting as they are pretty rich but a very enjoyable beer everyone should sample."

Bourbon and barrel are prominent on the nose and palate, followed by dark roasted malt, char, roasted coffee beans, black cherry, and notes of molasses and licorice. This is boozy, yet smooth and easy drinking. Syrupy mouthfeel, with a long and slightly bitter finish. Outstanding beer, and one that I'd like to try again after another year in the bottle."
298,NeroFiddled,Parabola,4.57,"Firestone Walker Brewing Co. ""Parabola 2015""

Notes: Labeled at 14% ABV. Very dark brown-black body beneath a short head of tan. Malty in the nose with notes of dark malt, Bourbon, roastiness, charred oak, vanilla, and coconut. The flavor is intense. It's malty, sweet, and a touch ""hot"" from the alcohol with notes of coffee-like roastiness, Bourbon, milk chocolate, dark chocolate, plum, molasses, charred oak, caramel, vanilla, and coconut. It's full bodied on the lower end and remarkably smooth and creamy. There aren't too many beers like this one.

299,illusionistlynx,Parabola,4.52,"Everything you could want from a bourbon barrel-aged stout, as long as you don't want the barrel notes to overpower it's dark complexity. An excellent stout by all measures. The recommended serving temperature of 55F is perfect."

L: Solid, jet black. Very slight desaturated brown head.
S: Strong sweet chocolate nose, a bit of something like caramel and even some coconut. A bit of booze.
T: Dark coffee and chocolate brownie, not terribly sweet. Again, something akin to lightly toasted coconut flakes. Surprisingly there seems to be some more acidity than I was expecting. Big boozy finish.
F: A bit lighter than expected, but still fairly heavy. Slight carbonation. Moderately warming.
O: A brighter stout than I was expecting, but still fantastic. Just the right amount of warmth, and plenty of rich, dark and sweet flavors to play with. One of the best stouts I've had."
301,Pivopijak,Parabola,4.3,"bottle into glass
Very quickly dissipating, light caramel brown looking head. One CANNOT see any sign of light through this concoction of very dark, murky brown. Rich and slightly sweet, toffee, caramel and a noticeable amount of the bourbon barrel it is aged in, with a very little hint of the very dark roasted barley, underlying, for the aroma. Whoa!, there is a big wallop of nearly burnt grains that lends a pretty sharp edge to the initial taste and that taste, but the edge fades at he end of the finish. The taste also includes a bit of toffee, caramel and hint of the barrels, but that ultra roasted barley malt prevails."
302,Jw13,Very HHHazyyy,4.49,"Pours milky yellow-orange like most Treehouse DIPAs. Smell is very similar to my memory of Haze - peaches and hops. Taste echoes the peach notes, but adds a good amount of bitterness. Unlike Orange Thing, which I tried yesterday, the bitterness here seems disconnected from the fruit flavors, whereas in Orange Thing it felt like a part of the whole ""orange"" experience. But overall a very well executed ""upgrade"" to the Haze family."

It is a clear, reddish plum pour with half a finger of pure white head. It looks less thick than many of the HF saisons I have tried, but ""prettier"".

Tart plum bursts from the bottle and fills the room. As I pour it gets even stronger. My salivary glands fire before I even put nose to glass. Such a delicious aroma, it calls, entices, with fresh plum, tart sourdough, raspberry jam, grape must notes, honeysuckle, hints of spicy alcohol and fresh flowers, in perfect balance to create a stunning aroma.

All the flavors of the nose are here, no need to repeat them, balanced perfectly, in a wonderful blend. It ends a lightly jammy whih fades into a tart, fruity linger. As it warms hints of an herbal bitterness enter the mix, quite lightly, and it gets even better.

Medium body for style, light carbonation which works well here, clean as a whistle, with a brilliantly flavored linger that is just right to bring on desire for next sip.

Another masterpiece from the master I regret not tasting fresh. It has either remained or become a beauty of a beer that is an artistic work of intoxicating refreshment"

The nose is dank and packed with sweet peach aromas, orange peel, some grapefruit, and lots of mango and pineapple. This is literally a beer fruit basket of aromas.

The peach flavors lead the taste and are delicious, with the orange, mango, and pineapple flavors following, with a bit of green grapes mid palate and a nice creamy oat flavor on the finish. Very balanced and oh so delicious.

The mouthfeel is full, soft, and creamy, adding to the drinkability. This is a magnificent representation of the style, IMHO."
318,cjgiant,Headroom,4.24,"On tap:
Cloudy bruised peach with a typical hazy head that clings to the edges pretty well. Nose is melon and unripe tropical fruits midway through without any agitation. Giving the beer a swirl ripens the fruits pretty quickly, giving a sweeter impression overall (some sniffs expose an overripe burn, but it’s not the norm).

When cold, the beer opens with an almost tart fruit note, which contrasts poorly with the more bitter middle and finish. It doesn’t completely disappear as the beer warms, but it does mellow out and blend in better. The sweetness notes in the nose after a swirl pervades the opening through to near the finish, reducing the contrast, but taking the bitterness I enjoyed in the back end of a colder beer.

This beer went from a disjointed start with highs and lows to a more balanced, but also more typical, very good hazy."

Raspberry sours tend to really perform well in terms of appearance and aroma and this is no exception. Beautiful ruby red in the glass with total clarity, although not much head at all to speak of. Looks like a fine red wine. Aromas are fresh crushed raspberry jam, fruit leather, cherry pie, pink lemonade, airheads candy, fruit chews, and a hint of wheat. Flavors lean very tart -- lemon juice, unripe raspberry, apple cider vinegar, salinity, drying oak astringency, and almost no sweetness at all. Feel is slippery and puckering. Tasty but a bit sour for me

79/100"
325,WunderLlama,Atrial Rubicite,4.58,"Long sought after whale that I found at my local liquor purveyor …heck, I could have walked to this store( nah, I’m lazy). This is Blend 13. Ranked #2 on BA in the wild Al style and#65 overall ….call me Ishmael …let this whale hunt begin 

The style according to BA is sometimes Belgian influenced, American Wild Ales are beers that are introduced to ""wild"" yeast or bacteria, such as Brettanomyces (Brettanomyces Bruxellensis, Brettanomyces Lambicus or Brettanomyces Anomalus), Pediococcus, or Lactobacillus. This introduction may occur from oak barrels that have been previously inoculated, pitching into the beer, or gained from various ""sour mash"" techniques. Regardless of the method, these yeast and/or bacteria leave a mark that should be noticeable to strong, and often contribute a sour and/or funky, wild note. Mixed-fermentation examples will display a range of aromatics, rather than a single dominant character.

Brewers notes : Atrial Rubicite is made from well water, barley, wheat, hops, farmhouse yeast, native yeast from the Texas hill country, souring bacteria and raspberries. It’s 5.8% alcohol by volume, has a finishing gravity of 1.005 and is 3.36 pH. It is unfiltered, unpasteurized and 100% bottle conditioned. Atrial Rubicite is our first beer to be packaged exclusively in 500 ml bottles.

Chilled bottle poured into a rinsed and dried Schilling teku glass. Deep ruby colored liquid crowned by a one finger pink froth. Settles to a pencil thick layer 

The aroma? Waves of raspberry jam, raspberry tart , raspberries …it smells amazing …tidal waves of raspberry on the pour . Sniffing the glass also produces some funk with a whiff of oak 

Taste is tart raspberry , oak , funky . The tartness dominates the flavor however the residual taste is raspberries. I roll my tongue over my teeth and gums and it’s like I had a carton of raspberries , wonderful 

Mouthfeel is prickly tartness 

Great beer, recommended"

Solid wild ale... dirty, nutty, raspberry drenched... not too acidic or biting, well balanced... I did enjoy its rustic funk... not sure how travel to NJ affected its quality... given its price ($24), I would rather try this again on tap at the brewery... wasn't quite worth it... it's not particularly distinctive, but the Jester King ethos alone will draw me back to trying more (2234)"

Flavors of candied tangerine peel, guava, passion fruit, with a bit of help from some medium toast malt, in the background, to fill out the body and some of the flavors.

338,Damian,Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped,4.55,"Drank from a 1 pint can purchased on Tavour
Manifested 11/15/23
Served in a tulip

Pretty extreme appearance. The beer poured an insanely cloudy, almost milky looking, straw yellow hue. A thin, frothy film topped the liquid, but it quickly dissolved. There was no lacing whatsoever.

The aroma was fantastic. It was super dank and fruity. Tropical fruit notes came through strongest. Loads of tangy passionfruit and sweet mango. Ripe peach was also apparent. Bit of juicy citrus too. The dankness subsided pretty quickly but reappeared later.

The flavor profile was also impressive, though more bitter and somewhat simpler than the nose. Citrus notes dominated. Nice mix of juicy orange flesh and bitter orange peel. Tangy tangerine notes were also apparent. Touch of lemony tartness in the center. Hint of passionfruit too. More citrus peel and rind-like bitterness on the back end and the finish.

The mouthfeel was amazingly fluffy and soft. Medium-light bodied for the style. The beer contained a super fine and zippy effervescence that gave this beer and terrific suppleness on the palate.

Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped Is an impressive beer and similar in many regards to some of the better offerings by Tree House, Trillium, etc. From what I can recall, this DDH version is better than the original, but I would need to do a side by side comparison to confirm this."
339,mschrei,Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped,4.9,"Long time want, missed out on first chance I had to buy on Tavour. Wish I got more than two. Pours like thick cloudy orange juice, minimal head and lacing. Smell is strong on the pour, still lasts as it’s drank: citrusy-orange, grapefruit. Slightly dank and a hint of pint. Big juicy citrusy taste, mildly tangy. Medium bodied, crisp, super easy to drink. Just as good as the original - one of the best NEIPA’s I’ve ever had."
340,UWDAWG,Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped,4.35,"Poured from a 16 ounce can dated 11-15-23 into a teku glass.

Taste- Clementine, pithy, grapefruit, pineapple, pine, between medium and high strength of flavor.

Feel- Full body, slightly below average carbonation, mildly astringent, moderately bitter, moderately creamy, mildly prickly.

Overall- Nice drinking experience, but the pithiness was a slight detractor."
341,beergoot,Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped,4.09,"Exquisite soft, light, milky yellow body; relatively thin head, white and lasting. Pleasant scent combination of biscuit and light citrus notes. Well-balanced flavors; oats and wheat with a nice hop citrus bitterness; white grapefruit.

Overall, a very nicely done hazy India pale ale. The double dry hopping isn't extreme in any manner. This would be very interesting über fresh, say, on tap at the brewery on release day.

Clear signal red colour, moderate pink head. Intense aroma of raspberries (no surprise). The flavour is very sour with notes of lemons and raspberries, fairly dry and crisp."
357,Parmesan,Abricot Du Fermier,4.68,"L: Pours a very strong pale orange yellow with no head and no lacing on the glass.

S: A nice toasted oak leads off, followed by a nice hint of Brett, some nice apricot and notes of sour tartness, very nice aroma.

T: A strong Brett and apricot mixes with lots of sour and tart, and a nice strong toasted oak. Amazing golden sour.

F: Smooth medium body and good carbonation.

O: This is a world class golden sour ale."
358,drdiesel9483,Abricot Du Fermier,4.57,"Look - slightly hazy orange with a great thick white head and sticky lacing and rimming
Smell - tart candied apricot woody
Taste - for SP, not as tart as some. Still tart but pretty great. candied Apricot and woody like the smell
Feel - Medium body and carb, slight creamy... lasting tingle afterwards
Overall - really fantastic beer!!!"
359,JohnnyHopps,Abricot Du Fermier,4.4,"Appearance - The beer was the color of an apricot. It was golden orange with some red hues. Carbonation was visible. 

Smell - The apricot seemed dry in the nose, but you could easily can detect a funk of a saison. 

Taste - At the front, the apricots were quite sour. It really tingled the sides of the tongue. There was an undercurrent of fruit sweetness. Toward the back, the funk of the saison came through and provides a sense of balance.

Mouthfeel - The body was vicious, almost like an actual fruit smoothie.

Overall - I can definitely appreciate a saison like this."
360,WickedBeer,Cable Car,4.55,"2020 Vintage.

Clear golden coloration; soft white head of carbonation settles in a thin ring around the beer.

The nose opens with a musty sweetness and candied lemon peel. Really nice balance of funk and citrus.

The palate is tart and predominantly fruity, with a bit of a tightening pucker on the back of the palate and a long, mildly acidic finish. Nice juiciness to the overall profile.

A touch of dryness, with a soft finish and gentle lingering tannin."
361,hopley,Cable Car,4.53,"2019 version, drank 06.19.22 out of a Hill Farmstead bulbous wine glass. Straw color with very delicate islands of head but other than that, not to much there. Not too much nose either. Funky and acidy taste, strong. Very pungent, strong and tasty. Pretty amazing beer. Just wow."
362,beerwithmeIRL,Oude Geuze Vintage,4.98,"375ml Bottle 2016 - pours a cloudy dirty orange with 1.5 finger foam head that dissipates to leave good lacing. On the nose it is incredibly complex with sour notes of vinegar/white wine, followed by fruitiness and funk & pepperiness. Taste wise, incredibly complex but follows the nose (you can understand why it's complex so!). Beautifully balanced nonetheless and an astonishing gueuze, definitely on of the best I've had, if not the best (and priced accordingly!)."
363,WormGod,Oude Geuze Vintage,4.85,2016 edition from last year. 375 ml bottle. A little oak on the nose. Just enough carbonation to make the mouthfeel great. Taste makes me want to drink it all day.
364,HOWEverSpence,Zombie Dust,4.35,"I mean, what can you say? Just a fantastic beer. You take that, couple it with the fact that it’s readily available across most of the U.S. and you’ve got yourself a solid option for a great tasting Beer."
365,ThorSon,Zombie Dust,4.52,Outstanding. Great beer with a balanced hop. Ordered on tap with steak. Will definitely get this again.
366,FRANKHAZE,Zombie Dust,4.6,Top notch in all aspects. No wonder it's #1 in its style.
367,Kterrain,Zombie Dust,4.05,"It's good but I don't really understand the hype. I like super hoppy beers but there's a balance between IBUs, sweetness, and grain flavor here that is missing for me. That said, all those hops make for a wonderfully fragrant pour and despite my disappointment I would try this on draft if I saw it."
368,crisis1290,Zombie Dust,4.31,"Not much more to say about this iconic beer.
Nice balance between the hops and malt !"
369,buffaloman,Zombie Dust,3,Way overrated
370,LarryV,Zombie Dust,3.15,"This one was canned on 10/20/23. I don't see if around here very often because it tends not to be a big seller in this area. I can understand why. I don't care for the flavor profile at all - just weird, I can't really describe it. Certainly not worthy of the ""100"" rating on BA. Give me a Stone IPA any day, blows this one away."
371,matcris,Focal Banger,4.49,"Orange, grapefruit, pine, dank, mild onion, both in aroma and flavor. 

Head recedes fairly quickly, mild lacing.

Medium full body, bright carbonation, very dry, and balanced more like an APA; bitter over sweetness. 

Reminds me a bit of a cross between DFH 60 and a 90.

Nice, quality brew, but I would go for HT over this one everytime."
372,Dakin,Focal Banger,4.9,It's smooth as fuck but packed with flavor. You can't beat it. Has to be in my top 10 beers.
373,Roxchambeau,Focal Banger,4.77,"From the back of the cooler - Score!

Drank from the can, so look is null. Smell of citrus, some pine resin, and a background of tropical fruit. Taste follows, with bitter and pithy grapefruit. This brew is closer to more widespread ""fruity, hazy IPA"", but the hops are just so totally showcased with an extra dimension missing from most brews. Average carbonation and pretty standard mouthfeel for the style. Not as standout as Heady, but an excellent IPA and definitely unique. So glad I was able to try!"
374,Spoklahoma,Focal Banger,5,Perfection in a can.
375,mvanaskie13,Focal Banger,4.45,"Poured into a goblet: color is straw gold, hazy but not murky/dense, head is brighter white with mostly fine bubbles, head presents one finger thick, dissipating to solid top. Left 1/3 in can to taste in parallel to glass poured liquid. 

Smell is oh so enticing - citrus pith, light onion, hint of pine, herbs, mango, oat, wheat, biscuit. 

Taste is more citric forward, pith and orange, earth and onion, pine and herbs, wheat/oat/biscuit grain flavors. 

Mouthfeel is soft carbonation, moderate sweetness, moderate bitterness; lingering pith bite on the tongue. 

Overall an excellent NEIPA - aroma/flavor/feel are all emphatic; I think I prefer it to Heady Topper but might have to taste simultaneously to confirm."
376,MalteredBeast,Focal Banger,4.53,"Lives up to most the hype. I prefer the overall experience of FB over heady but I love the dank smell of heady. Both great beers but not only is focal a better all arounder, it’s much more crushable."
377,russpowell,Focal Banger,4.6,"Pours a hazed gold/honey color with one finger of eggshell colored head. Stellar lacing & head retention, didn't see a ton of floaties; did pour it with finesse, which doesn't always happen 

S: Oranges, melons, some pineapple & papaya once warmed up

T: Pomelo, oranges, limes & grapefruit up front, dryness as well & a little pine kiss up front. Sweet orange, lime, grapefruit & green melons as this beer warms up, along with plenty of dryness/piney notes . Finishes dry with pineyness, grapefruit & a little green melon to balance things out & just a little peach at the end

MF: Medium body, creamy carbonation, nice balance that tacks bitter

A juice bomb that will please most purists not fake fruity or over sweet here. So drinkable"
378,Bryan-K,Focal Banger,4.24,"Well done, garlic/onion plus pithy citrus rind and hop resins that coat the mouth. Heady without the blast of weed"
379,dnoahg,Focal Banger,4.82,"Canned on 11/20/23. Poured into an Imperial pint glass. 1-finger head that never dissipates. Pours a hazy straw color.The hop blast when you open the can is delightful. But I’d be lying if I said I was discerning grapefruit (which I always liked but haven’t been able to experience for 20 years or more thanks to statins, so I’m a little rusty). What I can say is the beer has a moderate citrusy flavor but the malt sweetness is more prevalent. Overall, an excellent beer drinking experience."
380,Curt2969,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,4.48,"2019 (10th anniversary) vintage. Not the best stout I've had, by far, but certainly a fantastic brew. Highly recommend!"
381,DIM,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,4.41,"I haven't tried many of this type of beer to make a fair comparison, but I can see why this has received so much love. Hole-a mole-a sauce this is tasty. Up front the bitter baker's chocolate is accented nicely by earthy vanilla, mild pepper, and faint spice. The chilli kicks up significantly heading into the finish, pretty much right into my heat sweet spot. Just a great beer that I am so glad to try, thanks beergoot!"
382,papposilenus,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,4.13,"From a 500ml bottle, dated 03/11/23. Served in a spiegelau tulip glass.

Pours a thin-appearing oak-brown with no obvious highlights. A generous finger of lush, coffee colored foam doesn’t last but maybe 20 seconds leaving a narrow collar and a rousable spatter of oily, super-slippery lacing.

Nose is… fruity? A sweet, candy-like coffee aroma and, totally unexpectedly, raspberry - which must be an olfactory hallucination, or at least how my brain is interpreting the combination of vanilla, cinnamon and chiles.

Taste is sweet but not heavily so, with a berry-like coffee bean flavour and that fruity mélange of cinnamon-vanilla-chile pepper that my brain persists in translating as ‘raspberry’ bringing a brightness and lightness which keeps the beer from tasting syrupy. A slick Cadbury-like milk chocolatey character becomes more evident as the beer warms accompanied by some heat from the chiles. There’s a very faint soy sauce quality in the aftertaste which doesn’t detract much.

Feel is oily-smooth and creamy-slick, medium bodied but a little light relative to the style with gentle, prickly carbonation. Chile heat builds up on the palate somewhat and amplifies the otherwise mild carbonation, lightening the mouthfeel further.

Overall, pretty good but maybe a little bit of a mixed bag. I won’t call the flavours ‘muddled,’ but it is a very ‘busy’ flavour profile which, weirdly, for my palate, comes across very fruity and raspberry-like."
383,MadMadMike,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,3.88,"2022 pint can, chilled, left to warm. Flat black on the pour, thick, sticky, tiny bit of struggled foam that vanished fast.
Smells like cinnamon, vanilla, cacao nibs, and chilli peppers being muddled together.
Tastes the same. Just too much going on. Cloyingly sweet and thick, slightly gritty, too much cinnamon, and who needs hot peppers in their stout?
Overall, I’ve attended 5 Hunahpu’s Day celebrations at the CCB Spruce Street brewery over the years and have bought a bottle or can each time and come away thinking the same thing: nice novelty.,. but way too busy and quite over rated."
384,Roy_Hobbs,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,4.33,"2020 vintage received courtesy of @roguer. 

Appearance is typical for the style, which means it's a nice looking dark, dark brown with a half inch of tan colored head. Nice legs. Aroma is wonderfully rich and decadent, but not in an artificial way. Plenty of sweet molasses, chocolate, a hint of vanilla, and some faint figs / raisins. That description doesn't do this any real justice, so in summary, this beer smells great. 

Taste is interesting. Nowhere near as sweet on the nose, with some naturally bitter cacao notes, cinnamon and pepper combining brilliantly with the base beer. The spiciness is Goldilocks.....just right. A bit less and they wouldn't be notable. A bit more and they would overpower. There's a really nice sweetness deep into the finish that helps add to the complexity of this beer. Fully bodies and smooth, leaving a really nice coating on the tongue with a pleasant alcohol warming. 

Overall this is excellent."
385,Rug,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,4.31,"2018 vintage

We’re nearing the end of the BIF beers I got from @Eziel back in February, and this one is a heavy hitter. This has been a big want for me for a while, so it’s awesome to finally be able to try it. Let’s see what this famoud spicy Stout is really all about

Pours nearly pitch black with 2 fingers of reddish brown head that fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing

This is highly complex in the nose, not too peppery and balanced in its sweetness. I’m picking up on aromas of cacao nibs, vanilla bean, chili pepper, spicy whiskey, burnt coffee, sweet toffee, brown sugar, and light charred oak

This is a bit restrained in taste, perhaps due to the age but I still really enjoy it. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting dark chocolate, roasty coffee, chipotle pepper, vanilla bean, spicy whiskey, toasted oak, cinnamon, and toffee. The swallow brings notes of milk chocolate, chipotle pepper, vanilla bean, caramel, toasted oak, earthy whiskey, and burnt coffee

A full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a smooth and earthy beer. Finishes mostly dry with a lingering heat

While I enjoyed this, I’d hardly put it on legendary status. Again, maybe it’s the age so I’d love to try it fresh, but even still"
386,Smakawhat,Green,4.41,"Poured from the can into a Spiegeual IPA glass. Canned Dec 18th 2023.

Classic frothy and rich forming fine tall four to three finger big head. Small bubbles and cream white with a tellow like shine to the top and some island like retention. Pale orange solid body, with a hint of shine and maybe some yellow hues.

Creamy sensing aroma. Mild touches of light herbs to pine and citrus oils with excellent hop forward presentation. Creamy hinting vanilla, maybe even some biscuity malt notes which make for a real good bakery dessert like quality. Quite nice nose here.

Palate is really wonderful. Big hinting touches of cream vanilla mixing with herbal sage and some big touches of green earth. Supportive real rich malt backbone with an excellent young green hop angle but doesn't come out biting or painful. The finish is the most impressive thing, chewy pastry like sweet malt mixing touches of icing sugar, with building mint that gets menthol like hot in the perfect building intensity. Excellent malt surprising presentation that slow comes to fruition after some time also.

Really well crafted IPA. Doesn't have a real distinct nose but it's flavor is first rate and world class."
387,Jw13,Green,4.64,"Darker yellow very hazy pour. Lots of citrus and pine on the nose. Flavor follows suit but adds a touch of pineapple. Strong grapefruit rind bitterness follows, leaving you wanting more.

My favorite of the Treehouse core beers"
388,Takeahike1,Green,4.27,"This is another Treehouse that varies a fair amount in taste due to either a) batch or time (measured by the week), or b) day to day based on my particular taste buds. That said, it is always good, but sometimes it is fabulous."
389,Ketch_ski,Haze,4.89,"IMHO this is a better beer than Julious and Green as well as their ""very"" cousins and should be in the top ten NEIPA. Such a perfect balance of taste and feel."
390,NewtotheBrew,Haze,3.56,Pretty freaking decent. Probably fantastic on draft. Bit of a harsh aftertaste
391,whitro17,Haze,4.91,"Look - hazy, thick juicy, nice foamy white head, scattered lacing left behind
Smell - peach, orange, tropical citrus
Taste - peach, citrus pith, pineapple
Feel - medium body, well carbonated, citrus pith bitterness 
Overall - Tree House Haze all in my brain, Lately things just don't seem the same. The citrus pith bitterness is strong in this one, which I love. Strong citrusy scent right off the bat too. Tropical juiciness, peach and pineapple tantalize the taste buds. Hoppy finish lingers. This brew is excellent and even better when paired with Purple Haze by Jimi Hendrix. Acting funny but I don't know why, Excuse me while I kiss the sky. Cheers!"
392,edthehead,Cable Car Kriek,4.65,"OG. Murky pale red appearance with loose bubbly light light pink fast fleeting head. Nose and palate is bold and jammy cherry, cherry skin, slight funk, oak, and tastefully tart. Moderate body and carbonation, creamy mouthfeel. Held up amazingly well."
393,Rug,Cable Car Kriek,4.44,"2021 vintage

Review 2100! For this next landmark review I got my hands on the seemingly rare yet highly rated Cable Car Kriek. I haven't had anything from Lost Abbey in quite some time either (exactly 1000 reviews ago apparently), so I'm excited to try this legendary Kriek. Let's pop it open and find out what it's all about

Pours a cloudy reddish orange with just a few pinkish white bubbles that quickly fade to nothing and obviously leaves no lacing

It's so fruit forward and tart in the nose. Not too much funk but that's fine by me. I'm picking up on aromas of sour cherry, apple cider vinegar, sharp oak, lemon zest, crackery malt, jammy blackberry, lime zest, and light red wine

In taste it's much brighter and I'm all about it. A bit more funk is present here but still nothing crazy. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting sour cherry, cherry pit, lemon juice, crackery malt, almond, lime zest, brown sugar, sharp oak, apple skin, and light leather. The swallow brings notes of sour cherry, dry oak, jammy blackberry, lemon juice, tannic red wine, crackery malt, almond, and light brown sugar

A medium body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a sharp beer. Finishes bone dry and refreshing

This one is awesome. Absolutely worth seeking out if you like Krieks"
394,Holderness,Cable Car Kriek,3.16,"2021 vintage. Ruby red body with surprisingly little carbonation and no head whatsoever. Aromas are pretty standard kriek: cherry pie, lemon, hay, bit of vinegar. Very little funk, which is a bit unusual. Flavors are acetic but also semi-sweet, with predominant notes of cherry and apple cider vinegar. Feel is slippery and a bit flat due to the low carbonation. Overall I think this is one of those beers that made waves upon release when the idea of Belgian lambics was still relatively unknown in the US, but now that we have broader access to some of the best Belgium offerings here in the states it doesn't quite hold up. Especially given the price point ($90/750ml), I would not buy this again but happy to have the opportunity. 

64/100"
395,Zaximus,Cable Car Kriek,4.33,2021
396,WickedBeer,Cable Car Kriek,4.28,"2021 Vintage.

Gorgeous ruby red pour; very few agitated bubbles of carbonation as it’s poured into the glass. It settles flat.

The nose is still distinctly Cable Car, with noticeable yet restrained funk and lemony citrus. The cherry adds more brightness and is a fresh, fruity addition. With time, a lot of oak and Brett comes to the forefront.

The palate is sour and noticeably acidic, with a surprisingly low carbonation. Was definitely hoping for more of it to cut that tart cherry and acid, but overall it’s never overwhelming. The tannin from the cherry works really well with the overall profile. 

As stated above, not sure if that much carb was lost since 2021 or it was just never very high, but I felt it needed more. That said, it drinks bright and refreshing, with restrained tannin."
397,NewtotheBrew,Doppelganger,3.4,"Not bad, not amazing though. Another good tree house beer though, for sure."
398,NiceTaps,Doppelganger,4.49,"Pint can poured into a stemmed tulip IPA glass.

Murky thick apricot colored creamsicle. 1-plus F white cap with waves of lacing.

Juicy citrus and tropical fruit aromas. Pineapple, orange, and grapefruit. It’s dank and dry.

Positive juice flavors follow the aromas. Soaked malt with citrus variety led by grapefruit.

Dense yet flowing juice feel. The sweetness come through the hops and kicks out bitterness. Full and smooth.

Strong neipa version."
399,DavetotheB,Doppelganger,4.59,"From a 16oz can dated 11/15/22 into a tulip. Can message: ""Keep cold drink fresh"" BA description says 8.2% abv. Can says 8%.

Pours an opaque brownish orange with about one finger of white head. Great retention, excellent lacing.

Major aroma alert: Pineapple, oranges, mandarins, melon and juicy fruit gum.

Juicy taste-big juicy taste. Maybe not as distinct as the nose. Citrus juice, pineapple. Also some citrus rind bitterness. Light earthy notes. Incredibly well-balanced juice and bitterness.

Soft but thick, full-bodied mouthfeel. Balanced bitterness and juice aftertaste. Low to medium carbonation.

Wow. Great one right here folks. Loving it."
400,cdinardo21,Doppelganger,4.37,"Pours a hazy orange yellow color. Super juicy tropical flavors, and about as dank as Tree House gets outside of the Bright series. Slightly floral, with a subtle grapefruit taste. It's smooth and silky as most Tree House hazies end up being. Very above average beer."
401,JJKBeerLvr,Doppelganger,4.66,"Poured from a 16oz can into pint glass in October 2022. There was a canned date of 04/19/22 @ 05:59:33 on the bottom of the can. I bought this at the brewery, and drank about 2 months from purchase.

Appearance: Deep gold color with 2-finger white head. It is deep with a very hazy complexion, like many New England IPAs. Head is very thick, and it lasts a minute, leaving a small covering. There is a medium amount of lacing on the glass.

Smell: Strong aroma of citrus and pine, as well as some hops and pineapple. The citrus and pine aromas dominates the other aromas.

Taste: Bitter taste from the hops with a moderate sweetness like citrus. The sweetness and bitter edge are well-balanced. Has a very nice after-taste that lasts a moderate amount of time. Overall a nice balance and very drinkable.

Mouthfeel: Medium body. Average alcohol, which matches the 8.2% listed on the can.

This is an excellent New England IPA. It has a nice mix of citrus, hops, and other flavors, which makes it enjoyable. Another outstanding IPA from Tree House. I like the overall balance, and would buy this again."

S: fresh mango and pineapple, white grape juice, tropical fruit
T: orange and grapefruit peel,, orange, some mango, vegetal hop pine bitterness, dry 
O: very good lighter bodied NEIPA, taste is less tropical/juicy than expected and more dry and resinous"
403,cdinardo21,Fort Point Pale Ale - Double Dry Hopped,4.58,"Likely the best pale ale I've ever had. Just hits every note - perfect balance, ton of flavor. If I could have this in my beer fridge at all times, I would. It just curb stomps the vast majority of pale ales I've had. Great citrus flavors, nice body. Surprising high ABV for a pale, which probably helps the flavor profile, but I'm not taking that as a detraction - this is a fantastic beverage."
404,MutuelsMark,Fort Point Pale Ale - Double Dry Hopped,4.43,"Deep orange in color. No head created, at all. Nose was the least desirable quality, mainly due to not much there, especially given the color and extreme citrus taste. Taste is the magical moment. Superb beer. Surprised it is not considered a NE Style though."
405,snaotheus,Fort Point Pale Ale - Double Dry Hopped,4.31,"2022-03-06
16oz can served in a stemless wineglass. Dated 01/25/22. Received from @WunderLlama in NBS BIF #14.

Pours super murky whitish yellow with a medium sized head that dissipates into a medium sized ring and a fairly large but thin island of fine bubbles in the center of the glass. Smell...well, for starters I been catching whiffs of it for where I set it, arm's length away (and I have long arms). Smell is gorgeously tropical juicy, pineapple/mango/orange. Lingering resin sense that is difficult to extricate from the tropical juicy stuff.

Taste is much pithier / redolent of fruit skin than the aroma suggests. It's bitter up front, lots of resin, and the tropical juiciness is strong but lurking not-so-subtly in the background.

Mouthfeel is medium bodied, dry / drying, slightly gritty. This is a very good beer."
406,jngls,Fort Point Pale Ale - Double Dry Hopped,4.49,"One month old. Can to wine glass.

Look: Pours a pale, but somehow full and hazy yellow with a large-pored white head that dissipates quickly without leaving any lacing. No floaters.

Smell: Fresh citrus notes. Mainly lemon with hints of grapefruit.

Taste: Yellow citrus fruits. Fresh and hoppy. Zesty and bitter body with a dry finish. Low sweetness.

Feel: Very juicy with a medium carbonation and a sharp zesty punch.

Overall: Full and juicy Pale Ale with a strong focus on fresh citrus fruits. Could easily be mistaken for a DIPA. Very challenging compared to other Pale Ales with its full body and its dry finish. Great beer. Very intense."
407,jimmybram,Swish,4.65,"Pale, opaque orange with thin tan head. Standard hazy look. Smell is complex with pithy rind, orange, vanilla, and malts. Similar smell to some of the Hill Farmstead IPAs. Extremely bright taste with tons of tropical, sweet notes however has a nice bitterness at the end. Pleasing feel that doesn't linger too long. Swish is a spectacular hazy that stands uniquely in a sea of copy cats."
408,1009,Swish,4.59,"Bissell Brothers is the Larry Bird/Magic Johnson of breweries to me. Not a knock at all, but my MJ is the Alchemist. That being said, the Swish drops in to my stomach like a Steph Curry logo 3 point shot. Nothing but net, all swish. Beautiful Laker gold color. Completely opaque with a slight bubbly froth. On the nose you get Phoenix Suns orange with some Miami Heat tropical pineapple notes. Was expecting a thick Shaq like body but it’s a more lean medium body, reminiscent of a Dwight Howard. Taste wise you get the traditional IPA bitter hop bite that gives a slight Celtics green herby taste. However it also has that new wave NEIPA melon, cream, citrus fruit flavor. The NEIPA is the new dynasty, the Golden State Warriors of the beer industry. What an absolute treat, go Nuggets."
409,Bouleboubier,Swish,4.62,"(16 oz can, 011073 04-17-23; purchased cold 4-pk at the brewery 2 days ago... poured into my Trillium fat tulip)

L: impenetrably-hazy, pale yellow-amber liquid with mildly golden highlights on the fringes... moderately tall foam rise on the pour, sinking back into a misty cap... bit of a letdown from the lame head retention and little lacing

S: lime hull, lemon peel, mango funk, grapefruit pith; slight capsicum spicy accent... cream of wheat... vibrant greenness cutting through the perfumy fruits... the booze does boost the contact and seduction

T: much more malt and mush than I'd anticipated, and it's great!; floral rush halfway, morphing into a tropical cleaver into the finish, during which a powdery grain flour note swells up and hangs up front long into the aftertaste... almost halfway through and wow! did the tropical hopping burst back onto my palate, fresh and enlivening... masterpiece of balance for its ilk

F: only a faint sense of alcohol at the back of the palate; the milky grains and silky hop resins team to tame the heat I suppose... I wouldn't go any higher with the abv for this style; 7.5% is usually my sweet spot, and this is just tickling the tonsils, just inching toward unnecessary noxious-ity

O: not a fan of hazies, but this shot right up into my top 3 or 4; they really do have a good thing going as I've very much enjoyed the unique character of each brand I've tried from them... I could definitely see getting this again (good excuse for another beer run to Maine); it has a lot going on for the style; some depth and dimension to the gritty grain bill; too smooth and moreish (2122)"

T: Oranges, dryness, mangoes, dryness & green melons & strawberry up front. Mangoes, peaches, green melon & a little acidic pineapple, plus a little dryness as this beer warms, Finishes a little dry with plenty of pineapple, green melon & strawberry

MF: Medium body, restrained carbonation, nicely balanced, acidity on the tongue

A brilliant take on the style, pretty juicy"
411,cdinardo21,Swish,4.74,"On tap at Mekong in RVA. Hazy darker gold with a proper head. Huge citrus and bright tropical fruit juices with a slightly floral aroma. Big balanced grapefruit and other citrus, which is tamed and balanced. Super juicy and refreshing feel. Majestic IPA."
412,Beers-es,Swish,4.25,"On tap, pours a moderately hazy orange. Taste is dominated by a bright berry flavor, assuming that's from the Mosaic. Solid NEIPA, but not the standout its rating would suggest."
413,Sheppard,The Broken Truck,4.47,"Pours golden with frothy soap off white head. Mustyness and wash rind cheese with a touch of apple flesh on the nose. The first thing that stands out is that this is soft - it doesn't have any commandeering characteristics that detract from the others. I get some apple, some arugula bitterness, with restrained acidity. Maybe some musty sour cherry too, kinda like what you get in a kriek but very much more subtle. This is an excellent excellent spon beer. One of the best beers of this variety I've had in some time."
414,rodbeermunch,The Broken Truck,4.63,"Man if I had to put potentially the best beers of 2022 against each other, it might be this and that Gueuze from New Glarus. Whooo boy, some good'uns. This is the '22 bottle.

Pours yellow out on the river. Summer winding down, let's finish it up. Hits some amazing funky sour spontaneous notes. And they said it couldn't be done on this side of the pond. Just a delight to smell. The best of what Tilamook has to offer. Boasts fresh french oak feels, bugs, grapefruit, lemon rind, bleu cheese, green apple yogurt. The gang's all here.

The taste was such a nice thing, great bottle on one of those awesome yet sad close to summer beers. Made it memorable. Its vibrant, fresh cut hay and oak alongside some citrus wedges like you just stomped some kids at youth soccer. One of the best expressions of brett ever in a beer. Sawft body too, never felt too acidic or sour. This is honestly better than most Belgian gueuzes. I realize given the demographics of beer nerds, they're going to keep fetishizing Western Europe, but I'll be more than happy to take any of these Wisconsin and Oregon gems off your hands."
415,WickedBeer,The Broken Truck,4.29,"Opened up No. 6 (1/20), 7 (1/21), and 8 (1/22) together and tasted side-by-side.

All three boasted a beautiful golden yellow on the pour, with frothy, aromatic head that was slow to settle into the body of the beer.

No.6 brought notes of lemon zest, oak, and white grape must on a sweet, musty backbone. No. 7 came on sweeter, with more of a citrus candy quality and a bit less Brett character. The oak component had more of a ""freshly cut"" aroma to it, and preceded notes of bleu cheese that I didn't get on No.6. No.8 was probably the most distinctly unique; white wine like with 7, but more of a grapefruit-specific citrus quality and a deeper complexity of wet hay and an overall better balance of sweet & funky.

The palate on all three of these were led predominantly with drying tannin and bitter citrus peel. The oakiness was relatively similar amongst the three and bolstered the flavor influence from the yeast bill, however while No.8 showed its youth with the least amount of bitterness, 7 & 8 had comparable dryness and a more noticeable citrusy bitterness. No. 6 was also had the highest level of residual puckering tartness.

Light-bodied, dry, and lightly bitter mouthfeel to all three. As mentioned, varying levels of tartness / acid, but all very soft in their carbonation and smooth in the finish.

Overall, I'm honestly surprised with how similar each vintage of these beers was. Each had their own unique nuances, but when broken down you could find very similar characteristics on both the nose and the palate with both, characterizing a predominance of fresh oak, Brett, bitter citrus, drying tannin, and a noticeable albeit subtle funky/cheesy quality on the backbone. Definitely fun to have these all side-by-side."
416,rodmanfor3,The Broken Truck,4.5,"OG batch 1 Broken Truck. 
Classic de Garde taste, similar in quality to all of the ""Bu"" beers that were bottled during the brewery's infancy. 
It lacks the nuance of Trevor's newer offerings; minimal funk, lesser barrel treatment, aggressively sour. 
Overall, a legendary beer whose story was greater than its contents."
417,JohnnyHopps,The Broken Truck,4.56,"Appearance - The beer, from a double sealed bottle, poured a golden color with an aggressively bubbled white head. 

Smell - The brett character came out in the nose with a degree of bitterness. 

Taste - Grass, green apples, and a brett character that really stands out. The finish had a bitter earthy quality. It was not particularly sour, but it definitely brought the funk. 

Mouthfeel - The carbonation was aggressive, quickly sweeping away any sweetness. 

Overall - No fruits or adjuncts are needed. This was great."

Overall - best coffee stout I can remember"
420,DIM,Triple Shot,4.43,"Canned 2/2022. I'm pleasantly surprised by how sweet this isn't, just a hint of rich semi-sweet chocolate at finish. The nutty, roasty base makes for a wonderful coffee showcase throughout."
421,JohnnyHopps,Triple Shot,4.53,"Appearance - The beer poured a deep black color with an inch of tan head.

Smell - The beer smelled like fresh roasted coffee with roasted bean notes and chocolate in the profile.

Taste - Overall, this was like espresso with a huge body. There were notes of fresh roasted coffee, fudge, chocolate ice cream, and just a hint of vanilla. The sweetness came out more in the finish. In the big picture, it was an assault of espresso.

Mouthfeel - The beer had a nice thick clingy body. It allowed the bitterness to linger.

Overall - This was a really nice stout with a lot of coffee. Finding a more intense coffee stout would be a challenge."
422,NCSapiens,Triple Shot,4.38,"Nice dark black color with outstanding brown foam and lacing. Smell is nothing to write home about—water, slight roasted malts and a faint sweet coffee.but it tastes fantastic: deep coffee tones permeate throughout and a sweet molasses cover a base of toasty malt stout. Cheers."
423,Tony210,I Let My Tape Rock,4.5,"BBA from Wakefest 2022
Pours dark and fairly thick, minimal head. Has some coconut floaters. Massive chocolate aroma mixes with light coffee and sweet vanilla; coconut lingers on the finish. Flavor is molten chocolate espresso lava cake, chocolate covered coconut flakes, I get a little cherry cordials on the finish. Thick and creamy, yet there is a hint of lively carbonation. Overall an amazing beer, a year old and the coconut is still there.

431,jrc1093,Ephraim,4.25,"Canned on 5/25/22; consumed on 6/14/22

Pours a hazy, largely translucent dark orange body topped with two fingers of fluffy, slightly off-white foam; good head retention leaves a half-finger of cap, a slim, frothy collar, and myriad spattering of webby/spotty lacing strewn across the walls of the glass.

Aroma highlights dank orange oils and accents of sunflower petals/general florality upfront, leaving crackery malt lingering into soft, grassy resins glossing over soft lemon peel over time.

Taste features waxy peach zest within a resinous overlay as grapefruit steadily washes over a catty/peppery undertone; light moss and wilted mint over the mid-palate fade to residual pine past the finish.

Mouthfeel brings a medium body and a choppy fluff of moderate carbonation, dispersing dry textures and a pseudo-bittering over the mid-palate before eventually fading to a flaky crispness; a resinous glide brightens over the back end as bits of residual grit prickle the finish.

A warming aggression peeks through the stability of crackery malt and floral resins, an unforeseen grit waving across the normally clean Hill IPA profile; the subtle bittering and choppier tones of earth the result ultimately lend to a slightly more varied and intense profile to contrast the largely delicate base."
432,Ozzylizard,Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,3.52,"Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb 2022 – from Fremont. Received from @snaotheus in a ninja strike during BSBIF#1. Reviewed 04/02/24 (Review 3240). Note that I use DD/MM/YY protocol.
Printed on the bottom of the front label of the bomber “LIMITED 2021 RELEASE”. Stored at 34 degrees at home. Served at 55.0 degrees F in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. The final temperature was 60.2 degrees F. 
Appearance – 4
First pour – Amber Brown (SRM 18), slight haze.
Body – Black (SRM 40), opaque. Under direct light, same with tiny carbonation bubbles rising. When rear-lite, light penetrates at the bottom edge – ruby – and the top edge, citron.
Head - Average (Maximum three cm, aggressive center pour), brown sugar, high density with a few rocks, fizzy, short retention, leaving a 0.2 crown and partial cap. 
Lacing – None, as expected at 13.5% ABV.
Aroma – 3.25 – Chocolate and hints of bourbon. No yeast, no hops, no malt, no spices, no alcohol (13.5 % ABV as marked on the label).
Flavor – 3.5 – Begins bitter-sweet with chocolate and mild bourbon. No yeast, no hops, no roasted malt. On the aftertaste, weak coffee, and cinnamon. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl. No ethanol. An uncomfortable gastric burn occurs.
Palate – 3.5 – Medium; somewhat syrupy; soft but lively carbonation.
Final impression and summation: 3.75 The label sets expectations high but the product fails to hit them. The flavor is that of cheap caffe mocha with a bit of cinnamon and whiskey thrown in to make it interesting. In general, unharmonious flavors are vying for attention. Aroma isn’t bad, nor is appearance (any time the appearance is the high point, expect problems). Overall, IMHO a missed target from a brewer that usually nails it."

436,mschrei,Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,4.91,"I didn’t know if I’ve had this before, but tonight I went through my Fremonts and saw I had two, so....

A beer that lives up to the ratings and rankings. 

2018 vintage, and if this has faded, I can only imagine how strong it is fresh.

Pours dark, frothy creamy head and persistent lacing. Strong scents of cinnamon, coffee, and bourbon barrel over dark malt. Taste is very strong flavors of cinnamon, coffee, dark fruit, cocoa, and bourbon barrel. Damn, does this taste good. Medium bodied, mouth watering, a very barrel forward presence. 

This is just a goddamn great beer. Although I probably won’t let my second bottle get too much older, as this is in prime drinking time."
437,DEZ01301960,Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,4.41,"Purchased on Tavour. Dark caramel color. Smell awakens the senses with coffee & cinnamon dominating. Taste follows, light bourbon an the back end. Feel is medium thickness. Overall, a wonderful strong ale."
438,ChainGangGuy,Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,4.2,"8 ounce pour - $10.00 at Woodstock Beer Market in Woodstock, Georgia.

Appearance: Presents a very dark brown-hued body with a slim, scant ring of beige foam.

Smell: Resounding, rich dark maltiness infused with cinnamon-vanilla infused sugar, (subtler) coffee, chocolate powder, German dark bread, dark syrup, dark fruits (all tings dark, really).

Taste: Sweetish dark maltiness of toasted black bread, rounded roasted barley, scorched raw sugars with a mellow-minded earthy, woodsy quality from the spice and barrel. A pleasant, agreeable spiciness, particularly with the cinnamon without venturing into heavy-handed crap-can Red Hot candy territory. Dark fruitiness a little raisiny. Touches of vanilla creme, Dutch stroop. Subtle coffee infusion. Good amount of barrel character, it's certainly warming though never heated or hot. Continued traces of fruit and spice on the silken finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-plus body. Low carbonation. Smooth, supple mouthfeel.

Overall: Enjoyable."
439,augustgarage,Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,4.39,"2022 vintage. Poured from a waxed 22oz bomber into a snifter. 

Clear bistre kissed seal brown liquid topped by a lasting event-horizon of desert sand. Thick, fine lacing; shimmering sticky panes of tears; excellent retention.

Champurrado, cocoa, cinnamon, and earthy coffee with a hints of kretek in the nose. Very mild.

Intense palate entry, heavy/sharp sweetness with waves of blackstrap, coffee, walnuts, black currant, and fig. Moderate earthy bitterness washed away by the alcohol (hints of rum and irish whiskey, and port more than bourbon) and spice notes in the long medium finish. Low tartness with hints of oak comes and goes.

Rich, creamy, medium-full bodied, with low astringency and good round carbonation. A tiny bit hot perhaps.

An interesting base beer not overwhelmed by adjuncts, though quite coffee-forward at the moment."

T: Grapefruit, orange and lime. Strawberry and peach as well. Hoppy and grassy. Less sweet than its taste with a bitter finish.

443,JohnnyHopps,Saison Du Fermier,4.56,"Appearance - The beer was golden yellow with an inch of white head. 

Smell - The nose had elements of lemon and rubber. The aroma was not entirely appealing. 

Taste - The taste profile began with notes of sweet dry apple, before shifting to fresh cut grass. The funk was nicely balanced with a backbone of sweet white grapes. The dry funk of the farmhouse lingered on the roof of the mouth like lemon tea. 

Mouthfeel - Pleasantly carbonated, the beer had some sticking power. 

Overall - The beer is definitely worth seeking."

T- rich and malty up front with bold brownie batter, caramel, espresso, toffee and molasses. Mid-palate brings out a rich barrel note, adding bourbon and an enhancing note that brings out the vanilla addition.

450,colts9016,Bourbon Paradise,4.32,"1822
Name: Bourbon Paradise
Style: Barrel-Aged Imperial Stuff
Location: Kreb, Oklahoma
ABV: 13.7
Date: 2022

Continuing with stouts, I chose this from Prairie. Using my Jester tulip glass, I let the beer warm up to 56 degrees. A hard pour created a half finger, medium dark tan head. The retention is dismal, and dropped as fast as it formed. The color of the beer charts arounds SRM 36, dark brown with ruby hues. The beer is opaque but does show some carbonation bubbles on the sides of the glass. Overall the appearance is average for this style, I wanted to see a longer lasting head. 

Nosing the beer, I detect dark chocolate, vanilla, coconut with espresso. After smelling the beer several more times, I notice caramel, bourbon, oak, hints of floral, dates, raisins, slight char, roasted malts, bready, and a touch of Maillard. 

The chocolate weaves coconut with vanilla seamlessly. Other flavors in the beer are caramel, bready, roasted maltiness, raisins, figs, oak, bourbon, oak, anise, soy sauce, oranges, hints of floral, Maillard, and char. 

The heavy roasted malts gives the beer a heavy body and a low carbonation. A chewy thick mouthfeel and a lasting finish. 

The beer is tasty, yet I have a few complaints. I wanted more coconut flavors and less char. Overall the beer is a wonderful example of Imperial stout. I enjoyed sipping this one on a cold winter night."

452,Lucular,Bourbon Paradise,4.5,"On tap at Frisco Taphouse in Crofton, MD. Definitely lives up to expectations - pours pitch black with a tan head, huge aromas and flavors of dark roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, bourbon, vanilla, and some coconut. Rich and sumptuous mouthfeel. Stellar."
453,Tilley4,Bourbon Paradise,4.63,"It's incredibly rich and decadent....it's delicious....perhaps the thickest creamiest beer I've ever had... the bourbon is quite evident, as it should be... the coconut wafts in and out like a ghost....incredibly intense experience....having this on Black Friday morning while cooking a breakfast casserole... warming to the belly after a few healthy sips...this is a real banger. 

The sort of beer you pull out for just the right moment.. I love it...one is enough due to its intensity and richness...

A masterpiece..."
454,IvoryBilledWoodpecker,Bourbon Paradise,4.28,"Poured from bottle to wine glass. Super dark color with rich brown head. Totally opaque, head is very small and is soon totally gone, there is some lacing however. Strong scents of soy sauce and dark malt, I like this though it is bordering on being too strong. Taste, there is a lot here. Extremely rich, strong flavors of raw coconut, bourbon, soy sauce, roasted malts, licorice. It is delicious but it is simply too much. The beer is creamy and the finish is incredibly long. A great beer but it is just not for me."
455,SpeedwayJim,The Rusty Nail,4.37,"22oz. Waxed and capped bottle into a Tree House teku. Props to Fremont for having the best wax in the biz!

Pours thick, black. As much an imperial stout as any I'd ever seen. Super thick and oily legs that brings spotty lace. Nose is tart cherry cola, roasted malt, cinnamon, and chocolate. Quite unique. Prickly, sweet. Very aromatic. Beer opens cinnamon sugar, sweet plum, and chocolate. Some chili, molasses, and fudge in the middle. A touch of spice towards the end with an aftertaste of syrup, tobacco, and booze. Body is full with with low carbonation. Slick and smooth on the palate and goes down rich and warm with a long, lingering aftertaste.

Really good. Great complexity with the body to execute it. At the same time, not so heavy as to wear out the palate."
456,flagmantho,The Rusty Nail,4.46,"Poured from 22oz waxed bomber into a tulip. This is the 2023 vintage release; this version is 14.1%. I had this beer ages ago when it first came out, but I'm just getting around to reviewing it now!

Appearance: dark as a moonless night with a starless sky. Impenetrable. Head is a thin layer of tan foam; that could be a little nicer.

Smell: cinnamon right up front, but with enough vanilla from the bourbon and a dash of licorice to really give the feeling of a sweet bread. I mean, this thing is as sweet as summer days are long, but the overall vibe is ""great big hug from a panadería"" and I am very much into it

Taste: sweet, of course, but with a very bakery-like sensibility, as in the aroma. The licorice and alcohol give the otherwise sweet cinnamon-roll flavor a more mature dimension. I really love the complexity of flavor and juxtaposition of elements here. It's diabetes in a bottle, but hey, I don't really need these feet!

Mouthfeel: rich body with a good carbonation and a smooth, satisfying creaminess. Maybe not perfectly silky, but damn fine.

Overall: the drinkability for a 14.1% BA stout is truly astounding. This beer is a sugar bomb; I'm really going to have some explaining to do after my next A1C evaluation. However, that doesn't mean this beer isn't goo-ooo-ood."
457,rodbeermunch,The Rusty Nail,4.11,"Yet another time to be alive pour, this one also came during the tap takeover for BeerNV right before the Alabama show at Lake Tahoe. This was the 2022 version. 

Pours black. Even though its the same color as a stout, I expected greater viscosity. Didn't amass much of a head. Some brown cherry cola like head but it was thin, 1/6"". Blew a hole down the middle. The aroma didn't yield much in the way of roasted malt, it put a much heavier influence on the barrel(s). Sweet bourbon and/or whiskey notes dominate. 

The taste gets a little more complex, perhaps its the stuff I loathe like licorice or cinnamon bark, actually making a yield that is more enjoyable than the sum of its parts. The mouth feel isn't hot or bitter like I was expecting, its a real smooth showcase for a pretty big beer, but it doesn't have that challenging edge that extreme advocate seems to desire. 

Its a pretty nice big beer and I don't like big beers that much lately."
458,RaulMondesi,The Rusty Nail,4.48,"I haven’t had a tetanus shot in a while, and the nail might be rusty, but I’m still going for it.

The nose features the barrel and a wee bit of malty char. Pleasant but unremarkable.

The taste reveals the licorice and cinnamon bark. They pair nicely and do not dominate as I feared. I'm wary of cinnamon in beer, but the deft hand of the brewers keeps things in harmony.

Mouthfeel is luxurious and finish is barrel. Not too hot but the booze is felt. There’s enough carbonation to satisfy."

467,BEERchitect,The Peach,4.34,"Never giving up on those childhood snacks de Garde takes the influence of fruit rollup and rolls it into a winey, earthy, tart and spicy wild ale. With lambic influences at the helm at well, this fruit rollup is corked, capped and ready for adulthood.

Pale gold and lightly of chrome, the light and yeasty haze of The Peach teems with bubbles while building a loose necklace of foam. Pulling from its white wine appearance, the session kicks of with a plume of stone fruit over a citrusy, tangy, earthy, briney perfume chocked full of both funk and fauna. As its mild mannered sweetness greets the tongue, the suggestions of communion wafer, sourdough and a hint of tafffy gives a soft and wheaten buffer to start.

As the malt sweetness bounces effortlessly from the palate, the tastebuds soon carry the brunt of acidity that pangs away with lemon, lime, white grape, crabapple, yuzu and passionfruit with a stronger acidic twinge. All the while, the peach character gives a melon-like roundness for a smooth stone fruit taste. Nearly apricot, mango and orange-like, the bright and ripe peach flavor is radiant. Trending peppery with dry oak and lightly bittered hops, hints of grapefruit, grape seed and a mossy earthiness provide an earthy and peppery exit from the palate.

Light, crisp and highly refreshing, the off-clean ale finishes briskly acidic with a series of short sourdough echoes laced with peppery white wine, saddle leather and oak tannin."

750ml capped/corked bottle served in a pair of little Cantillon stemmed glasses. Bottled 10/21.

Pours clear, light golden, with a small ghost of a head that disappears and leaves a tiny ring around the glass. Smell is tart and funky. A bit of wood, some dry chardonnay. Something musty. Very interesting.

Taste is dry, tart, very chardonnay buttery, peach / stonefruit notes are there but kind of drowned out by the woody / chardonnay notes. Tartness is somewhere between unripe peaches and lemons. Mustiness is some combination of the butter and wood notes I think.

Mouthfeel is medium to light, super dry, slight filminess, gives a sense of liveliness that might just be prickly acidity. Overall, it's good and very interesting."
469,REVZEB,The Peach,4.37,"Cloudy yellowy orange body, white cap settles into a collar quickly. Big peach nose, big barnyard funk, lesser so horse blanket funk, oak more than the cognac support but both there, slight floral notes too. Tart and somewhat earthy peach starts the taste before the dry and sharp funk massages the oak and light cognac into the peach, apricot, lemon, green apple all support, but finish doesn't elevate, rather it goes somewhat acidic with a hint of balsamic vinegar. Feel is bright, sour, decently acidic cumulatively, and funky, almost feel more vinous on the finish. Very nice peach wild ale. The 6th best? No, but still great on a cool summer afternoon on the porch"

473,Ozzylizard,Supplication,4.49,"Supplication (2023) from Russian River. 12.68 fl oz cork and cage bottle from @2beerdogs in NBS BIF #17. Reviewed 23/06/23 (Review 3127). Note that I use DD/MM/YY protocol.
Label stamped “BOTTLED ON 020823”. Stored at 34 degrees at home. Served at 49.8 degrees F in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. The final temperature was 55.9 degrees F. 
Appearance – 4.25
First pour – Gold (SRM 5), clear.
Body – Deep Gold (SRM 6), chill haze. Under direct light, opaque. When rear lite, chill haze.
Head: Average (Maximum 3.5 cm, aggressive center pour), champagne, high density, quickly diminishing to a 0.5 mm broken ring of bubbles with no cap. 
Lacing – None.
Aroma – 4.5 – Weak cherries and oak. No yeast, no hops. No ethanol (7.75 % ABV according to the label). 
Flavor – 4.5 – Cherry, slightly sour with some tannin. No yeast, no hops. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl. No ethanol flavor but pleasant gastric warming. 
Palate – 4.5 – Medium; watery; lively but soft carbonation.
Final impression and summation: 4.5 Another excellent brew from RR. Their combo of pediococcus, lactobacillus, brettanomyces and saccharomyces species yields a great tasting mixture of organic acids and other metabolic end products although as the temperature rises, the tannin begins to dominate. Still, quite good!"
474,hreb,Supplication,3.73,"375mL cork-topped bottle, bottled on 020823 (barrel aged 9 to 15 months, pinor noir barrels, with cherries). Served in my new stemless CBC glass. Brillian ruby color with excellent clarity and little head formation. Mild aroma suggests a bit of tartness. Flavor brings on a LOT of that tartness, approaching outright sour, but has a delicious ripe cherry flavor which complements the Brett nicely. Sharp carbonation is suitable here.

If I was more into sours I might find this outstanding. I find it more drinkable than Cerise Cassée, and I really appreciate the balance here. Unfortunately for me it's a balance between sour Brett and sweet cherries, not so much the oak and the brown ale underneath that I'd be more interested in."
475,Tsar_Riga,Supplication,4.44,"This pours out copper, a bit of haze, minimal head and no lacing. Nose is a punchy vinegar note, wine barrel and fruit beneath. Flavor is a less aggressive presentation of the nose, with cherry and full red wine elements melding into the strong acidity. The wildness also comes through as a counter to the acidity, putting some earthiness and funk on the back end. Well built and delicious."
476,Roxchambeau,Sip Of Sunshine,4.27,"Pours amber, fairly clear. slight Haze. 1.5 finger foam dissipates to a small cap and nice lacing. Smell is incredible! Leads with tropical fruit, with some nice hops underneath. The taste is slightly less impressive - pithy orange and a load of bitterness. Little bit of pine on the finish, which is another high point. The finish is dry and refreshing. Reminds me of a turned up Bell's Two hearted. Very good, but not 5/5 IMO."
477,Tuck_leepulin,Sip Of Sunshine,4.59,"16oz Can poured into a Spiegelau IPA Glass. Canned on date: 09/05/2023.

Appearance: Pours a rich, semi clear amber with 2 fingers of head

Aroma: Fruity hop aromas interspersed with some cracker-malt and fresh bread

Taste: Full hop flavor up front with bready malt notes in the middle with a clean finish that leaves residual hop notes, well-balanced without any excessive bitterness

Mouthfeel: Medium with a satisfying dry finish

Overall: An outstanding IPA that tends towards West-Coast yet being from New England. I purposely am reviewing a can thats 3 months old and it is still drinking fantastic"
478,TooManyGlasses,Sip Of Sunshine,4.46,"Packaged Sept 18/23 - purchased cold from convenience store in Stowe, VT - kept cold.
Pours a bright clear golden orange with three fingers of foamy just slightly off white head. A touch of chill haze.
A lot of ripe citrus and tropical fruit on the nose - pineapple, mango, papaya. Floral and piney and as warmed a touch dank.
Sweet tropical fruit, ripe orange, bready malt sweetness on the palate but with a spicy and piney bitterness, some notes of grapefruit peel.
Medium mouthfeel - smooth and slick hiding the 8% making it dangerously drinkable; moderate carbonation - bittersweet finish."
479,Greymane,Sip Of Sunshine,4.87,"Had my first taste in Burlington, VT in 2015. Hands down my favorite East Coast IPA."
480,KrakowBluegrass,Sip Of Sunshine,4.93,It’s a great one. I love everything about it.
481,cdinardo21,Keene Idea,4.37,"Old school piney crisp westie. Just a style that isn't brewed enough these days, and it's a real shame. Kick you in the teeth bitter - pours a delicious golden amber, and perfectly carbed. Very sippable. Not sure it lives up to the god-like status some hold it in, but it's a very solid west coast IPA."
482,TheWaySheGoes,Keene Idea,4.44,"Not sure why people feel the need to write reviews along the lines of ""it's an old style not fit for today's trends"".......it was brewed to be a piney, bitter, and malty beer and it's damn well crafted. If you were into trendy scotch drinks and were handed a glass of Louis XIII Cognac, would you poo-poo it for being different? Old school west coast IPA's exist for a reason, and they have certain qualities that make them different from the trendier new england style. This beer is a fantastic brew, with pine and malt flavors bursting onto the scene in a way you just don't find with most beers made elsewhere. When you take a sip, you just know it is a well crafted, and balanced brew."
483,shigg85,Keene Idea,3.75,"No. No, no, no. I can't understand how everyone takes this well-balanced yet boring double IPA and elevates it to a godly status. It's fine, but the flavors, scent, and mouthfeel stop there. As a California born dude, I above all want to champion our beers. This is fine, but it's just not the champ."
484,AzfromOz,Keene Idea,4.28,"Many reviews talk about the perfect balance between malt and hops displayed by this beer. They're not wrong. This beer has seen the tightrope strung across the canyon of drinkability and confidently trod the cord, using malt and hops as its balance beam while declining to use any of the 2020s' juiciness for a safety net. 

Make no mistake, this is a bitter beer. It demands an experienced drinker's palate, but rewards the garnered experience of a craft beer drinker with a beer that displays subtle citrus notes, a strong yet not overbearing malt backbone and a hoppy, piney, resinous kick that unashamedly proclaims its double IPA genes. 

In reality, this is an anachronism in 2022. It recalls the IBU wars of 15 years ago, but remains relevant because, at the end of the day, it's a damn good beer 

Cheers!"
485,MutuelsMark,Keene Idea,4.78,"Pours golden in color with a nice head that leaves a beautiful lacing. The nose is slightly sweet, almost honey like hint but a bitterness added. Taste is bitter that quickly goes away with a dry finish. Superb beer."
486,mactrail,Keene Idea,4.02,"Nearly clear amber brew with plenty of foam in the fat wheat beer glass. Lush with creamy carbonation. Malty and medium sweet. Aromatic with citrus and papaya. Taste is candied bitter orange, or marmalade. Very sippable and well made.

Hops are listed at Citra, Southern Cross, Nelson, and Pacific Jade. This DIPA bears the extra alcohol and malt well. A little of a hop overdose as you might expect. I have not had an Alpine beer in years so was happy to try one I had not seen. Brewed in San Diego. From the 16 oz can dated 10/25/21."
487,jrc1093,Rocky Road - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4,"2022 vintage; consumed on 1/20/2024

Pours a viscous, midnight-black body capped with just shy of a finger of dark khaki-hued foam; decent head retention leaves a slight layer of cap, lasting, frothy collar, and no lacing holding to the walls of the glass with any longevity.

Aromas of gooey marshmallow waft into fruity rye spice as a walnut underscore embraces bourbon vanillins against a milk chocolate build and barrel char lingering.

Taste brings cocoa resounding upfront, with bourbon vanilla interludes meeting a peak of chocolate-covered walnuts through the mid-palate while barrel char and darker cocoa residuals mark the back end of the profile.

Mouthfeel shows a medium-full body and a lower froth of carbonation, yielding a thick, malted slickness over the mid-palate as a prickly warmth and wispy char cuts through a modest yet overarching stickiness into the back end.

Minimal barrel yet true-to-form, the Rocky Road inspiration comes through in spades; an honest mock dessert à la sweet stout in typical Angry Chair fashion: comfortingly one-dimensional."
488,Sandis,Rocky Road - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.5,2022 version poured from a 750ml bottle into a plastic cup while camping outside Toppling Goliath for 2023 stout stock. I'd been chasing this one for a while and it did not disappoint. Creamy and medium thick.

491,stortore,Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.27,"12 ounce bottle into a snifter. 2022 edition, had 12/23/23.

Pours a semi opaque dark amber, with a short head and light foamy cling. Aromas of bourbon, caramel, figs, raisins, malt, oak, brown sugar. The flavors almost match: bourbon, caramel, figs, brown sugar, malt, oak, light raisins, a little cherry. Smooth, a very good medium body, appropriately carbonated on the low side. 

The barrels and the caramel and fig notes stand out. Very enjoyable, but kind of thought it would be better, after hearing about it for so long. However, the cap came off with almost no resistance, so maybe not at its best. Have one more bottle to adjust my attitude."
492,Holderness,Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.26,"2022 vintage

A -- Deep tawny brown in the glass with near total clarity and just a scant tan head produced with aerated pour. Minimal retention and some lacing
S -- Herbal hop, leather, smoke, toffee, musk, oak, dark roast coffee, char, nori seaweed, port wine. Got this real old cellar character. Many layers of complexity
T -- Tobacco leaf, molasses, caramel, wet bourbon, roast, astringent herbal hop, black licorice, and a hint of diacetyl on the back end
F -- Very full but low viscosity. Astringent finish. As expected for the style and the barrel aging
O -- A style I don't have all that often and this makes me wish I did more

86/100"
493,drdiesel9483,Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.34,"2022, poured December 2023
Look - Super dark brown with a big thick tan head and sticky.
Smell - barrel, leather, caramel, molasses and date
Taste - barrel, caramel, toffee leather, slightly sweet, slight bitter
Feel - medium full body slight creamy very light Carb.
Overall - interesting and more bitter than I expected."
494,The_Snow_Bird,Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.75,Pours a dark brown color into the glass with no head. Has a dark fruit and licorice smell with a hint of the barrel. Feels very thick when drinking with licorice taste. No way of telling this is a boozy beer when drinking.
495,Whyteboar,Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.58,"Poured all the world like cold brew coffee with as much carbonation. Wee bit of sediment but not enough to taste.
The aroma was lost on me. Stupid Covid.
The taste though, is all dark fruit; figs and raisins and plums. Leather and spices follow up the fruit and oaky flavors round out the finish. 
The feel is viscous, almost chewy. Almost perfect for the style.
OA, amazing old ale. I really need to try more of them."
496,LiquidAmber,Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.45,"Poured into a Fremont small snifter. Pours a very dark mahogany brown, appearing opaque black in the glass with a thin, light khaki head that dissipates to patches with slight lacing. Aroma of dark biscuit malt, bourbon, molasses, dates, raisins and nuts; bourbon forward. Flavor is dark malt, bourbon, dry caramel, dark rye bread, molasses, over-ripe dates and leather. Leathery bourbon finish.
Medium bodied with moderate creaminess, nice mouth feel, although slightly light in carbonation. I can taste the fine base Fourth Dementia in this ale and it really shows its bourbon barreling, although mostly bourbon flavor and not that much wood or oak. The base flavors seem more concentrated and melded, which makes sense for something aged for a while. Rich and flavorful. I have to admit, as a malt fan, that I think I actually like the base better; the malt takes second place to the barrel in this one and it was exquisite in the base Dementia. On the other hand, it's a fine old ale with bourbon treatment, which is a great thing in itself. I hope to get an opportunity to get these again in the future; I'll grab both versions. Wish there were more old ales around."
497,DIM,Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.43,"Comparing with the regular version I had last night.

Well the barrels killed the lovely, large, lumpy head, all I got with a hard pour was a small ring. The body is darker too, kind of a deep muddy brown.

On to what really matters, how does it taste? It is lovely and I slightly prefer this over the non BA version. The black tea notes here but bitterness is largely blunted by a lovely boozy butterscotch flavor. I don't get as much potpourri or baking spice, but both are in the periphery. Dark fruit and tangy cherry come out towards the finish. What a wonderful beer."
498,Bouleboubier,Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.55,"(12 oz bottle of the 2022 vintage; purchased cold in Aug at the brewery... shared between two tulip glasses)

Absolutely delightful, and somehow better than their standard non-BA version... tons of dried fruit in techicolor... prune, fig, brown bready cookie... if they could infuse some subtle funk into this, it shant be touched in magnificence... boozy malt nectar concentrate... this is the beer that'll draw me back to the brewery hopefully sooner than later... the empty bottle still contained its intoxicating scent days after... a fantastic achievement (2236)"
499,mschrei,Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.74,"Pours dark, a creamy tan head and mild lacing. Strong scents of caramel, toffee, vanilla, and bourbon. Taste carries over with those with dark fruit flavors as well. Medium bodied, strong booze presence, easy drinker. 
This was a longtime want and now I can get it from Tavour regularly. And I will certainly buy it regularly."

S: Bready, piney, lemons, mangoes. Pineapple shows up as this beer warms 

T: Follows the nose, dryness, pineapple & grapefruit up front. Grapefruit, limes, a hint of pine & dryness/breadyness once this beer is warm. Finishes a touch cakey with pineapple, grapefruit & a kiss of green melon

MF: Medium body, moderate carbonation, nice balance 

Classic West Coast DIPA, in your face, but very drinkable to the point of too easy. This would so be in my rotation if feasible"

503,Dwarfrat,Citra,4.6,"The first Citra was incredible. We found that bottle aging for ten days smoothed it out.
After a few years of substandard Citra hops resulting in a brew not as good as the first, it's back up to where it was in the beginning.
Since KRBC switched to all aluminum cans, the mouth feel is less wonderful than from a bottle.
It's best at the brewery.

505,Ozzylizard,Citra,4.46,"Citra from Kern River Brewing, 16 fl oz can from @2beerdogs in NBW BIF 17. Reviewed 25/04/23 (Review 3082). Note that I use DD/MM/YY protocol.
Lower rim of can stamped “CANNED ON 0?/2?/23”. Stored at 34 degrees at home. Served at 45.3 degrees F in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. The final temperature was 54.5 degrees F. 
Appearance – 4.25.
First pour – Pale Straw (SRM 2), clear.
Body – Pale Gold (SRM 4), hazy. Under direct light, same. When rear lite, translucent.
Head: Large (Maximum 4.5 cm, aggressive center pour), ivory, high density, average retention, rapidly retreating, leaving a 1.2 – 2.2 cm jagged crown and a rocky complete layer. As the head contracts, irregular elongated islands remain above the head.
Lacing – Good – remnants of the head following the patterns of the head, but thinner.
Aroma – 4.5 – Grapefruit and generic citrus (tending toward pineapple) backed by caramel malt, no yeast. No ethanol (8.5 % ABV as marked on the label) aroma. 
Flavor – 4.5 – Follows the nose. Begins and ends citrusy and full-bodied, a bit dank and resinous over caramel malt. No yeast or ethanol. Barely noticeable gastric warming. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl. Ends crisp and dry with a little resin.
Palate – 4.25 – Full; dry; lively carbonation.
Final impression and summation: 4.5 Good DIPA – dank, crisp, and citrusy."
506,TheWaySheGoes,Citra,4.68,"The smell is just unreal and this one is not for a first time IPA drinker. What a treat, and I hope they continue to expand with their distribution.

507,NeilSilber1,Citra,4.72,"Pours golden yellow with thin white foamy cap in small tulip glass on draught at Father’s office. Beautiful citrus pineapple, mango and hops on the nose. Really great springy DIPA bursting with Citra hops! Cheers to greatness!"
508,Thankin_Hank,Citra,4.51,"Citra pours a slightly hazy, cloudy amber color with a big beautiful head. A sixteen ounce, canned 11/24/22 is very strong with the Citra aroma. Taste is powerful and good. Citra and Amarillo go together well in this brew. Fabulously smooth and not really bitter at all. Overall a fine Double IPA."
509,kemoarps,Citra,4.35,"Both @2beerdogs and @Beersnake1 sent me cans of this one related to the recent NBS BIF#16, so I guess the California contingent feels strongly that I should try it!!

Beautiful clear caramel gold colour with a good finger plus of just off white foam. Soft and velvety with sprinkled large bubbles, it sticks to the glass as it recedes. 

Nose is a great showcase for citra hops, and that works for me, because citra is a great hop! There's some citrus, some pine, some kind of light honeysuckle and wonderful rich complementary caramel malts underneath. 

Flavour isn't quite as rich as the aroma, but it presents all the goodies. Bitter citrus and pine, some caramel malts, some round fruits... finish is bitter but not overpowering by any means. It's mostly in the pith/citrus side of things, but not the full on acid bomb of like a Monkish, and it's balanced with a little bit of earthy pine and a touch of the sweet malts to balance.

This is just a phenomenal beer all around, and right up my alley. I love what I've tried from Kern River, and I can see why both Tim and Derek both independently thought I should try this beer. Thanks, fellas!!"
510,Beersnake,Citra,4.35,"Poured from a can at fridge temp. Pours an opaque yellow with fluffy white head. The nose is tropical fruit, pine needles, marmalade. The taste is incredible.

Consumed 12/26/22

I was surprised to see that Trillium did a Xmas drop in the Chicagoland area of fresh hazy beers, so I grabbed some as soon as I could for my holiday week. I find that when someone can do a lower abv (6.6%) with a lot of flavor that that is more an achievement than knocking out a DIPA. My pallet generally goes toward liking the higher abvs, but I need the lower one once in awhile when having more than one beer in a sitting. I am loving the balance in bitterness here more than anything. The Midwest brewers love to land on the sweeter side, but I actually like the dryer bitter finishes more. The beer does lack quite a bit on the nose as I am not getting much beyond some citrusy hop notes buried deep. The feel is full and smooth. Overall a great beer. I wish I had a fresh Zombie Dust to compare to see which would win for me."
515,cdinardo21,Fort Point Pale Ale - Galaxy Dry Hopped,4.27,"Nice light fluffy pale ale. I love this line of pale ales in general, with the DDH being the best variant. Maybe due to having the DDH version first, I really expected too much of this. Full disclosure, this is very good. One of the best pale ales I've had, and packed with a lot of flavor for a relatively smaller ABV, and I do love galaxy hops - but this doesn't stand up to the DDH Fort Point."

518,BillRoth,4th Anniversary,4.43,"Growler from OH FLX 3 days ago. 
Big straw/lemon gold hazy with 1/2 inch creamy white head. Dissolves pretty quickly with decent residual lacing. Somewhat subdued nose but a complex mash up of straw, grass, lemon, lime, dank integrating with grapefruit comes out as beer loses initial chill. Taste is more prominent grapefruit and dank though juicy melon, malty biscuit, citrus also show off. Body is a nicely smooth medium malty body accompanied by a refreshing bright carbonation. Considering 10% and content weight…surprisingly refreshing.
Overall a great heavyweight IPA.
Glad I could try it as “draft”."
519,cambabeer,4th Anniversary,4.35,"Canned on 12/25/2025, Picked up today 12/30/2023 at Rockefeller center after fighting the crowds to look at a tree

Straw yellow body with some a bit of warm yellow orange if the light hits it right. White frothy head with nice sticky lacing down the sides. Nose is dank and boozy - grass, grapefruit oil, dried mango. Taste is bitter and boozy up front and then moves to the fruity mango, with very warm booziness at the end. Warm pineapple juice type sweetness, hoppy, thick and slick from the booze, this is not an everyday beer - but I don't think it's trying to be. What it is, though, is delicious and bold."
520,cdinardo21,4th Anniversary,4.52,2023 Anniversary Version - Really good IPA - nice hope mix - excellent balance - next to no booziness for 10% (as is OH's way) - creamy with plenty of citrus backing - very solid.

522,MilwaukeeBeerMaker,Leaner,4.25,Batch date 10/10/22; strong hit of acidic sour up front that transitions to a nice ripe juicy peach finish. Very delicious beer and glad I secured a bottle to try.
523,Knapp85,Leaner,4.69,"Just starting off by saying this beer is just stupid good, now that I have that out the way I'll continue with more detail. The pour of the beer isn't anything overly special, typical golden orange color, rapidly fading white head. The smell of the beer has that fruity Casey-like funk going on which is expected. The taste is honestly one of the best tasting peach sours I've had. I was truly blown away by the sweet yet tart peach flavor they were able to get out of this, incredible! The feel is medium bodied, finished dry and tart. Overall just outstanding!"
524,REVZEB,Leaner,4.42,"Had on tap. Bright yet somewhat pale yellow opaque body with a white head and trace amounts of lacing. Smell has big peach with effervescent bright oak, wild yeast, flowers and pollen aromas. Taste leads with peach juice and funk, playfully sour bright oak, flowers, wild yeast, a whisper of biscuit and apricot support. Feel is medium bodied, smooth, lightly tart and wild, bright. Nothing earth shattering, but a great wild peach saison"
525,russpowell,Triple Sunshine,4.76,"Pours an effervescent & hazed honey color with a thumb+ of cream colored head. Good head retention & lacing 

S: Citrus, pine, sweet oranges once opened up

T: Follows the nose, pretty cakey, a little dry, a kiss of pineapple, a touch of pine as well up front. Sweet orange, grapefruit, dryness, cakey notes & pine as this beer warms up. Finishes dry with grapefruit, pine, pineapple & a little cakeyness

MF: Fairly chewy body, but enough carbonation to push this beast along, superb balance!

Formidable, but plenty drinkable; dangerous! Probably as good as take on the style as I can remember"
526,cjgiant,Triple Sunshine,4.64,"Amber orange body has a light to moderate haze; head is fluffy white and sticky enough to provide lacing streaks. Aromas of hop citrus - tangerine and grapefruit come with a side of pine needles. A moderate sweetness on the nose translates to the opening of the taste, giving the lightly toasted malt a raw honey edge. It doesn’t take long for the candied orange to turn pithy. There’s a ring grapefruit and passion fruit note to keep things from jumping off the bitter edge. But thankfully, there is a slow decent into herbal, piney, and slightly earthy bitterness."
527,Beers-es,Triple Sunshine,4.66,"On tap, pours a clear light copper. Smell of citrus and resin hits from a couple of feet away. Taste follows, with a big resinous flavor that is surprisingly light and drinkable, especially at the ABV. Fantastic beer."
528,whitro17,Triple Sunshine,4.91,"12 oz. can - canned on 1/03/23
Look - deep gold, luscious bubbly white head, good lacing left behind

Feel - medium in body and carbonation, hoppy resinous sticky finish
Overall - Finally got hold of this gem on a beer haul from Vermont and it's just as great as I thought it would be. Like Sip and Double, the smell really pops right from the can and continues after the pour. No trouble picking up the dank tropical and herbal scent. Triple kicks off with spicy dank hops followed by ripe pineapple and grapefruit pith that ends with that wonderful resinous sticky finish. This is a bold brew that lives up to the hype so there is no other choice than to pair it with Sunshine of Your Love by Cream. I’ve been waiting so long, To be where I’m going, In the sunshine of your love!"

532,Holderness,Medianoche - Coconut,4.08,"On tap at Tip Tap Room, Boston. The best part of all these medianiche variants is the thick, vicious, velvety mouthfeel. Coconut is barely discernable against the already pretty strong barrel presence -- maybe a bit more nougaty than it would be otherwise. A little heavy handed in the sweet chocolatey notes

534,Beer_Economicus,Medianoche - Coconut,4.37,"This is my first time ever having a stout from weldwerks, and it's my first medianoche (I don't even know if they make stouts that aren't in that 'series'). This is really quite good. I'm a coconut fiend, and this doesn't disappoint It's essentially liquid dessert - milk chocolate coconut. To me, it's sweet but not diabetic sweet. It's less sweet than Coconut Vibes (Shared, aka side project), but it's also less coconut forward. Coconut vibes is also liquid milk chocoluate coconut, but it has a noticeable coconut pop. This is so integrated that the coconut is integrated, but not popping. I'd prefer the popping, but this is way easier to drink than that. If I was only going to buy 1, I'd probably buy coconut vibes only because of that noticeable coconut pop. GOD i love coconut."
535,GreesyFizeek,Medianoche - Coconut,2.28,"This one pours a fairly flat looking inky and gloopy looking black color, with no head or lacing.

This smells like pure sugar, cheap melted chocolate milkshake, coconut syrup, and caramel.

This is actually disgusting. This series used to be some of the best barrel aged stouts in the country, but Weldwerks has just gone off the deep end with these. It’s just tastes like sweet stout glue, basically – it’s basically liquified black sugar – it’s basically…you get it, right? It’s just way too sweet and cloying, with barely any barrel. There’s not even that much coconut, it’s just way too sweet of a base – just loads of cheap overbearing chocolate character.

This is too thick, and not drinkable at all, with very little carbonation. There’s not much booziness, but that’s maybe the only single kind of good thing I can say about this.

What happened to you, Weldwerks? Where did you go so wrong?"
536,Zach_Attack,Medianoche - Coconut,4.69,"This was scrumptious - wow! So much coconut on the nose and palate, plus dark chocolate, nice roast, bourbon, decent sweetness without being cloying; very thicc mouthfeel, great barrel; roasty, coconut finish."

539,JohnG190,Sunday Brunch,4.59,"Appearance: Sunday Brunch pours a deep, dark brown color with a thick, creamy head that dissipates slowly. 

Aroma: The aroma is rich and complex, with strong notes of coffee, dark chocolate, and a hint of vanilla. There are also hints of toasted oak and a slight smokiness.

Taste: The flavor is bold and intense, with a strong coffee profile and a noticeable alcohol warmth. The dark chocolate and vanilla flavors are present as well, with a slight sweetness that balances the bitterness from the coffee. There is a slight smokiness in the aftertaste that lingers on the palate.

Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is silky smooth, with a creamy texture that coats the tongue. The beer is medium-bodied and has a medium carbonation level, making it easy to drink.

Overall Impressions: Kane Brewing Sunday Brunch is a complex and flavorful beer that is perfect for sipping on a lazy Sunday morning. The coffee, chocolate, and vanilla flavors combine perfectly to create a decadent and satisfying experience. The alcohol warmth is noticeable but not overpowering, making it a great choice for those who enjoy a bit of a kick with their morning coffee. The smoky finish is a nice touch, adding an unexpected depth to the flavor profile. Overall, this is a top-notch imperial porter that is well worth trying."
540,MutuelsMark,Sunday Brunch,4.71,"Deep, dark black. Head was not as dark as I guessed it would be, more of an off white color. Strangely the nose is cinnamon at first, but after first taste then the nose was more coffee. Taste was cinnamon coffee with a smooth finish. Not bitter, all smooth!! Great Porter."
541,snaotheus,Sunday Brunch,3.69,"2022-02-06
500ml bottle served in a footed pilsner glass. 2021 vintage. Received from the glorious @jonphisher.

Pours very dark brown with a small head that fades slowly to an almost invisible skin and a small ring around the glass. Smell is chocolate and cinnamon.

Taste is cinnamon first, and all else second. Milk chocolate is definitely there. Some coffee bitterness. Might be a hint of syrupy sweetness.

Mouthfeel is medium tending toward thick. Overall, this is a good beer, but too much cinnamon for me. But, I'm a little oversensitive to cinnamon in beer."
542,Hayesbro,Sunday Brunch,4.85,"Pours black with a light brown solid head. Super coffee roast aroma, very pungent. Taste is heavy coffee as well, with a lot of maple sweetness; the cinnamon comes through strong as well. Thick mouthfeel, carbonation was a little lacking, which is pretty much the only flaw in this excellent beer."

545,MilwaukeeBeerMaker,Black Tuesday - Reserve,4.75,"2021 vintage bottle share at a bottle share on 12/3/22. Amazing beer; drank fairly easily and just a ton of flavour and barrel in the taste. It was a little on the boozy side, not terrible, but I'd expect that from a 21% ABV beer."
546,Rug,Black Tuesday - Reserve,4.52,"2020 vintage

Oh man, we have quite the big boy here. A 21% on a Tuesday afternoon? What the hell am I doing? Well, I’m on vacation this week and today turned out to be a stormy day, so I figured it’s the perfect time to crack this beer I received in a BIF from the legendary @Eziel. I’m getting close to the end of what he sent me, and they’re all heavy hitters. Let’s see what this one is all about

Pours a very dark brown with a finger of light beige head that fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing

There’s a definite sweetness in the nose, but it’s wonderfully balanced given its size. I’m picking up on aromas of chocolate fudge, earthy bourbon, toasted oak, nougat, black cherry, sweet caramel, molasses, toasted hazelnut, and light vanilla

This one really packs a punch in taste, heavy booze and char fight for attention while a huge sweetness backs it all up. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting charred oak, cacao, sweet bourbon, red grape, marshmallow, sweet vanilla, molasses, toffee, light nutty malt, and black cherry. The swallow brings notes of hot bourbon, charred oak, nougat, cacao, black cherry, molasses, apple brandy, vanilla, sweet caramel, and nougat

A full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a silky and slightly thick beer. Finishes mostly dry but boozy as all hell

There’s no 2 ways about it; this beer is incredible. So complex and hitting all the right notes. Perfect for a quiet day to myself hanging out outside while it rains"
547,GreesyFizeek,Black Tuesday - Reserve,4.22,"2021 batch. Most of the BT Reserve years is two sets of bourbon barrels, but this one is grape brandy and then bourbon.

This one pours a very dark black color, with a small head, and no lacing.

This smells like charred oak, lots of bourbon, lots of vinous grape character, brandy, roasted malt, dark fruit.

This is a nice bridge between some of overtly wine based Black Tuesday variants, and the regular bourbon Black Tuesday. The grape brandy adds a pleasantly oaky vinous character, sweet, but finishes dry, with oaky char, marshmallow, dark chocolate, caramel, roast, and bourbon.

This is medium bodied, slightly thin as most Black Tuesday variants tend to be, with a lots of concentrated booziness. It’s not overwhelmingly boozy, but it really kind of does drink like a distilled stout liqueur.

I haven’t had much Bruery in a while, but this was definitely a fun beer to revisit this brewery with. It’s definitely something to share with a bunch of people, like 10 people, maybe, but it’s well done."
548,bluejacket74,Black Tuesday - Reserve,4.56,"750 ml wax capped bottle, 2021 edition (aged in Copper & Kings grape brandy barrels for a year, then aged an additional year in bourbon barrels), 21.8% ABV, bottled 01/19/21. Served in a Black Tuesday chalice, the beer pours dark brown/black with not quite an inch tan head that fizzled away somewhat quickly. I like the aroma a lot, the brew smells like dark fruit, brandy, bourbon, vanilla, molasses, dark chocolate and roasted malt. I like the taste a lot too, it's similar to the aroma but with the addition of some dark bread, burnt/charred malt, coffee, licorice and earthy flavors. There's a lot going on here, but all of the flavors mesh well together with no one flavor overpowering the others. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's coating and a bit syrupy with a moderate amount of carbonation. Nowhere near as boozy as I was expecting considering how strong this brew is! Certainly worth trying if you get the chance to!"
549,bubseymour,Black Tuesday - Reserve,4.33,"I believe this was a 2018 bottle (4 years aged). Leaned towards a more licorice flavor. Didn’t pick up much bourbon. Solid beer/liquor drink (20% it’s hard to still consider this a beer). My guess is that perhaps it’s a little better if it were fresher, maybe 6-12mo age which is generally where I like my BA stouts."
550,MacMalt,3rd Anniversary,4.49,"Poured into a snulip glass. It pours a turbid, muddy tangerine color with a creamy, milk-white head and thick, clinging lacing. A big, fruity nose with lemon, lime, pineapple, grapefruit, pine needles, and floral hops. The taste is superb with a great balance between tart lemon, lime, and grapefruit, and sweeter notes of pineapple, tangerine, peach, and some tropical fruit. Beneath is a creamy, oaty base that adds sweetness. It's dank but not overly bitter. The mouth feel is luxuriously plush and creamy with a perfect level of carbonation, and the 10% ABV is barely noticeable. Overall, this ale is outstanding and it's important to remember than it was first brewed 7 years ago. We've become accustomed to New England IPAs with heavy New Zealand hops. This must have been mind-blowing when first released."

554,Beer_Economicus,XTRA DUBL Benthic,4.74,"2021 Vintage. Opened first within a couple months of release.

This is really fantastic, but so is regular benthic (2021), specifically and especially when fresh. Lots of coconut, but not in the pastry territory of something like Coconut Vibes. Coffee is still present, but balanced by the coconut. Mouthfeel is on point. 

I tried to rate this for what it is, not whether or not I felt a little let down - which I did. I had expectations that it would be a little more coconut forward. In fact, I'm not sure it is truly that much different than regular benthic, but that doesn't make it any less delicious. It just didn't quite meet the expectation I set for it."
555,Bhubbard34,Mexican Brunch,4.55,"Pours jet black like coffee without creamer. Little to no carbonation. Thin in appearance and feel. The smell is noticeable as soon as cracking the bottle. The taste follows the smell, sweet cinnamon and coffee dominate with subtle hints of chocolate. Maple is faint but adds a nice sweetness. Chiles almost non existent but that’s fine by me. Really enjoyable after dinner drink."
556,BEERchitect,Mexican Brunch,4.24,"Taking brunch south of the boarder, Kane Brewing looks to chili peppers, cinnamon and cocoa to give a decidedly Mexican twist to their imperial milk porter.

Mexican Brunch kicks off with a very dark brown pour and a frothy cap that fades rather quickly. As a scent of coffee rises first, a quick followup of syrup, chocolate, nuttiness and spice ensure a complex and enticing scent. Fully malted and sweet on the tongue, high impressions of chocolate, caramel, maple, toffee and vanilla play out in hot chocolate fashion in its early impressions.

As the flavors start to unfold, the middle palate holds onto its milky sweetness while the strong taste of coffee sets an earthy, nutty and roasty tone. Cinnamon and chilies mingle next for a sense of balance for the sweetness and to complement the coffee spice. Woodsy, earthy and toasty, the beer trails into a kahlua-like finish with balance and contrast in taste.

Full bodied and soothing on the finish, the beer finishes both spicy and calmly with the milk sugars and maple rounding out the gradual simmer of peppers into a warming afterglow of a Mexican inspired, alcoholic cappuccino."
557,larryi86,Mexican Brunch,4.57,"500 ml bottle poured into a teku

A- Black with a two finger mocha head.

S- Chocolate, cinnamon, some maple, coffee, some chili pepper, very well balanced.

558,tigg924,Truth,4.64,"Had on draft at Sandwich. Pours opaque,jet black in color with one inch head. Taste is big booze and whiskey, charred malt, fudge and vanilla. Heavy body, low carbonation, boozy. For a straight barrel Aged Imperial stout this is delicious...just enough sweetness and depth. Such a tasty beer."
559,WunderLlama,Truth,4.47,"Brewers notes = Truth is our Barrel-aged Imperial Stout. Featuring a blend of three standout barrels brewed and barreled in 2018, Truth is the purest expression of barrel-aged beer that we make. 

In the glass, we taste potent but balanced flavors of chocolate bourbon candy, sweet vanilla-like oak, tootsie rolls, and baker’s chocolate. Though the flavors are intense, they are beautifully balanced making Truth a joy to enjoy and savor as it warms up.

We are proud of this beer, and being the first time we’ve been able to enjoy it in almost five years, we are feeling very nostalgic.

565,defunksta,Black Note Stout,4.12,"Appearance: Pours a completely black, dark color with a massive and deep, rich, dark tan head. SRM of 24. (4.25)

Aroma: Strong aromas of bittersweet chocolate, cream, cocoa upfront. Some hints of coffee roast and more cream in the middle. Mild bourbon underneath. (4.00)

Flavor: Strong flavors of rich chocolate, bittersweet chocolate, cocoa, and cream upfront. Strong creamy chocolate notes linger before it evolves into a lactose and vanilla flavor. Some bourbon starts to balance, but ultimately the sweet chocolate cream overpowers and it finishes sweet and smooth. (4.25) 

Feel: Heavier-bodied, average to low carbonation. Sweet, malty, creaminess linger. (4.00) 

Overall: Rated 100 World-Class on BeerAdvocate and ranked #33 for American Imperial Stout. Supposedly similar to their Expedition Stout, but aged in Bourbon Barrels. Upfront drinks very much like their Expedition Stout. A beer battle between the two would be far too dangerous. Dark, chocolate, creamy, and sweet. Some hints of bourbon and minimal roastedness. The bourbon is relatively hidden within the sweetness. This one leans sweeter and rich in typical Bells fashion. I wouldn't drink this often. A sipper and almost an occasional or dessert beer I'd say. (Rating: 4.12)"
566,Mdog,Black Note Stout,4.35,"Appearance: Black, ok head at first, fades to nothing.

Smell: Strong roast and char, molasses. Surprisingly little barrel.

Taste: Dark chocolate, roasted malt, a little cherry alcohol hit, a splash of black coffee. Lots going on but the flavors are working together. As it warms up, the barrel starts showing up with some woody vanilla. Medium-heavy mouthfeel. More chocolate in the finish as it warms.

Overall: Finally getting to try Black Note, total wine had a shelf full. Very nice BA stout. I've been a little hit-or-miss with Bell's big stouts, sometimes they are not quite sweet enough for my palate, but this beer hits the spot. Very Good!"

subtle coffee, and dark fruits. Flavors find their mark with bourbon, rich oak, vanilla, dark dried
fruits of dates, raisin, blueberry, and blackberry, dark chocolate, and dark coffee nuances with

Somehow I’ve had like 4 Black Tuesday variants but this is my first time trying thr base beer. I’ve wanted to try it for quite some time and never saw it around so I was surprised when it popped up on Tavour recently. Let’s pop this beast open and find out what it has to offer

Pours completely pitch black with a finger of creamy tan head that quickly fades to a thin ring and leaves minimal lacing

The nose is very bold, and surprisingly not even that boozy. I’m picking up on aromas of cocoa powder, raisin, vanilla bean, molasses, toasted oak, brown sugar, sweet bourbon, light roast coffee, burnt caramel, black cherry, and light leather

The complexity is dialed back in taste in favor of something more bourbon-forward, but it’s still damn good. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting sweet bourbon, raisin, dark chocolate, molasses, charred oak, vanilla bean, black cherry, light brown sugar, and cinnamon. The swallow brings notes of charred iak, sweet bourbon, black cherry, molasses, dark chocolate, raisin, smoky tobacco, and vanilla bean

A medium full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a slick beer. Finishes mostly dry with some heat but drinks significantly below its abv

This is a classic for a reason so I just had to give it a bump in the overall. Great stuff"
574,sjrider,Black Tuesday,4.46,"Bottle pour, 2021 edition - dark as used motor oil with short foamy khaki head leaving a ring of tiny bubbles.

575,Blogjackets,Black Tuesday,4.47,"2016 version. Poured from bottle, the body is black with little head and lacing. 

Aroma is a boozy delight. Sweet bourbon with notes of dark fruits, oak, caramel, and vanilla. 

Taste thankfully follows nose as the booze is front and center. Despite this bourbon bring featured, it's never too hot despite the huge ABV. The booze is never hidden, but I would not had guessed anything near 20%. As it warms. a flavor arises that reminds me a bit of flat Coca Cola. Perhaps a wee bit of coconut. Delightful. 

Mouthfeel is good, soft and pleasing, with just enough carbonation. 

A very enjoyable stout that was still vibrant and powerful after aging for 7 years."
576,russpowell,Black Tuesday,4.59,"Pours an effervescent hazel/chestnut with one finger of fast failing mocha colored head. No head retention or lacing

T: Follows the nose, some cola & molasses notes, plus leafy hops up front. Some coffee, dark chocolate, a little vanilla as this beer warms up, along with oaky char, dark cherry & figs, plus some pleasing, warming Bourbon notes. Finishes with boozy dark chocolate cherry notes, a touch of vanilla, brown sugar, maple & oaky dryness. plus a kiss of Bourbon

MF: Fairly chewy, minimal carbonation, pretty darn warming 

Great & very potent take on the style. Great drinkability for the heft. Thrilled to have to finally tried this longtime want! This beer just got better the warmer it got."
577,Parmesan,Black Tuesday,3.56,"L: Pours a dark brown black that is a little thinner than expected, but has a small tan head that is larger than expected due to the alcohol and a nice lacing.

S: Some brown sugar and molasses, notes of vanilla, a very strong bourbon alcohol a light fig but the alcohol is huge in this and a bit over the top.

T: Lots of bourbon in this one, some fig and vanilla, a bit of molasses and brown sugar. This beer seems really far to the boozey ide and I feel like could use some more balance by showing off the more aspects of the base beer, than just the barrel aging. The barrel aging seems a little heavy handed to me.

F: Oily and slick mouthfeel, little tingling off the tongue from the high alcohol of this beer.

O: Honestly I wasn't super impressed with this beer. I prefer my imperial stouts to be a nice balance between the base beer and the barrel aging and I just felt like the bourbon barrel aging was heavy handed on this year. I believe this is a 2023 bottle."

581,UWDAWG,Beatification,4.18,"Poured from a 375ml bottle dated 1-25-22 at 51 degrees into a teku glass.

Look- Pale gold, very mildly hazy, plentiful small visible particulate, minuscule white sudsy head, nonexistent head retention and lacing.

Smell- Oak, funk, chardonnay, between weak and medium strength of scent.

Feel- Between thin and medium body, below average carbonation, highly dry finish, highly sour, moderately acidic.

Overall- Appearance was as expected with the exception of nonexistent head retention or lacing. Bouquet was good, but much weaker than expected. Flavors were good, but the sourness was slightly to much for my palate. The body was between thin and medium, but the carbonation was very noticeable low.

582,Holderness,Beatification,2.85,"Long, long time want of mine that I finally snagged in a beer store in Bend, Oregon during a recent trip. Bottled just about two years ago, which isn't too long in wild ale years, but I was surprised to find that whatever intended refermentation in the bottle didn't really seem to have worked out. The beer poured almost still with a distinct pee color. Barnyard-forward funky aromas -- hay, horse, must, herbal hop, and a bit of apricot. Taste has a good amount of that crushed aspirin bitterness alongside lemon, wheat, grapefruit juice, wildflower honey, and chardonnay grapes. Pleasant but fairly boilerplate spontaneous ale. Feel is not great due to the fermentation issues -- only the lightest of discernible effervescence. Overall a bit of a let down, but maybe it's just a bad bottle

< 60/100"
583,Falcon91Wolvrn03,Beatification,4.4,"Look – Pours a nice clear golden color with a nice head and good lacing that quickly disappears.

Taste – Sour grapefruit, brett, barnyard funk, oak, and chardonnay.

Feel – Light, crisp, nicely carbonated, a bit sour.

Overall – This is a well above average sour beer."
584,kemoarps,Beatification,4.17,"Sent my way as return fire by @Beersnake1 during NBS BIF#16.

Pours a pure golden yellow that's mostly clear, but I wouldn't describe as crisp. The colour, actually, isn't far off from a slightly lighter version of the label. Wet bubbles rise through the liquid, but there's no head, and thus nothing to retain nor leave lacing. 

Nose is bright and inviting. Starts off much more on the fruity side rather than the truly funky side (we're getting there, though, don't worry!) with some apple, and like meyer lemon. The apple transitions to a mustiness that gives rise to thoughts of wood, and carries us over to the earthier funkier side with light elements of barnyard and just a kind of tart element. 

Flavour is awash with an interesting lead in that I want to give credit again to that meyer lemon-type flavour, then bits of crabapple and wood giving way to the earthy funk again, which presents in a really interesting way that I can only think to describe as, 'open.' I don't know how that works, but where a lot of funky wild ales like this feel tight, compressed, bound up tartness, this feels like the pages spread wide and a more easygoing (but no less pronounced) welcoming earthy funk. The lemon and the funk kind of build together to a pinnacle about 2/3 of the way through that is more in the horse blanket realm and borders on harsh, though the rest of it feels aggressively tart, but in a welcoming manner. The back end takes elements from all of the above, along with a little bit of bleu cheese and faint honey to leave a tart dry finish. 

Very fine carbonation sits atop a decidedly funky/tart beer, but one that I wouldn't describe as sharp. 

I've had several in the -ation series, and they've all been top notch. This is no exception. Thanks, Tim for sending this along my direction!!"

I thought I was there for the IPAs but a family member ran into someone they knew with a goblet of another RRBC barrel-aged product who said ""I don't even like beer but I love this!"" I ordered my own goblets and was introduced to the loveliness of Sanctification and Consecration.

So began my love affair with RRBC barrel-aged stuff. The 100th percentile score is well-earned. This is a delicious sour, which offers common ground to people who normally will not drink sours. The more sophisticated reviews for this will fill in all the notes of stonefruit and granny smith apple stuff that my review lacks; all I have to say is, in the same way that you could serve PtE to someone who would never touch a DIPA with a ten-foot pole, a goblet of this can evangelize regular folks with unsophisticated palates like mine to appreciate the wonder of wild ales and sours made by skilled people."
587,cambabeer,Beatification,4.57,"Soapy white head that leaves a bit of lacing in a mostly ser throw straw yellow body. Funky, gristy, tart whiskey and oak nose. Taste is grains and sour earthen grassy Granny Smith apple, funky, sweet, vinous. Medium mouthfeel and champagne bubble effervescent. Wow"
588,folkstar,Beatification,4.4,"Bright citrus, delightfully tart …special and perfect . Doesn’t fatigue palate, earthy yeast is welcome"
589,flagmantho,Beatification,4.21,"Poured from 375mL bottle into my BeerAdvocate teku. Bottled 1/25/22, so it's got a solid year under its belt.

Appearance: lovely light-golden hue with a little tiny bit of haze and a finger of frothy white foam atop. Looks nice.

Smell: soft malt with a light sourness and just enough sweetness to give a light, candylike aroma. Enticing indeed.

Taste: tarter than the aroma would suggest, but with just enough sweetness to be balanced. The sour isn't super sharp, it has some softening around the edges. This is quite an enjoyable beer.

Mouthfeel: medium-rich body with a decent carbonation and a nice creaminess. It has both more body and less carbonation than I usually expect from a bottle-conditioned beer.

Overall: this is certainly a very nice sour and I'm quite enjoying it. I'm glad to have finally tried it, and while my experience perhaps does not match the raves this beer receives on this site, I am in no way disappointed."

591,tekstr1der,Alter Ego,4.46,"Feeling a bit spoiled after sampling a good variety of TH past couple weeks. This is a solid, delicious NEIPA all around, and does not disappoint. The wow-factor of some of their other offerings puts this in perspective though as ""just"" a fantastic beer."
592,Jw13,Alter Ego,4.6,"Very similar to julius, but a bit less sweet, with a bit more back-end bitterness. As it warms, berry notes begin to appear. I (slightly) prefer it to the original."
593,jimmybram,Alter Ego,4.55,"Poured with a crazy foamy head. Dark yellow color and opaque. A very unique nose, grassy and peppery. Less hoppy than most treehouse beers and malty sweet. Very soft feel. Overall a great beer and definitely a unique beer amongst Treehouse's hazy collection."
594,joaopmgoncalves,Saint Lamvinus,5,"This was drank almost a week ago, at Vítor Claro's home - the winemaker from Portalegre, behind the Dominó and Claro & Ferreira brands.

Trying to review this from the top of my mind.

Poured from the bottle to a stemmed wine glass.

A: The body is dark purple with a light purple, almost pinkish head. Created a generous foam quantity that lasted quite a while before jumping in.
S: The aroma is actually perfect without any overpowering acidity. It's balanced as it is sweet, savory, and acidic to the right point. It's a great beer only by smelling it.
T: It's the taste of heaven. I think that after Fou'Foune, this might be my favorite Cantillon beer. It's perfectly balanced with the sweet notes from the grain and the grapes embracing quite well the light fruitiness, and very light bitterness of aged hops combined with just the right amount of acidity incoming from Brettanomyces. It's really great with nothing to point to as a downside.
M: Body has just the right feel, being light with the cool effervescence and silky tones from the sweetness you can find in this beer. Bitterness is low. Acidity is mild.
O: As said before, this ranks at the top of my favorite beers. Unbelievably good."

597,BEERchitect,Society & Solitude #5,4.39,"With a blend of American and New Zealand hops, a well-engrained idea of what an imperial IPA should be. the talents at Hill Farmstead put their nose on the grindstone to develop the best taste possible from this hop medley. Society & Solitude #5 shows what's possible with the cooperation between the Pacific Northwest and the Land Downunder.

The foggy golden-straw beer takes the hues of sepia and puts it in a haze-infused and unadulterated pour. Its cottony swath of foam fills the room with a tantalizing fragrance of tropical, citrus and vinous fruits that wet the whistle by scent along. Its taste is succinct with the delicacy of sugar cookie and shortcake sweetness with a nearly tart interplay.

Its radiant fruit upstart soon makes way to a drying middle palate where the racy and radiant fruits come out to play- white grapefruit, branch-ripe orange, hints of lemon and white grape tease the tastebuds while the pulpy richness of under-ripened pineapple, passionfruit and kiwi round out the fruit punch and sherbet tangy-sweet flavor. Gooseberry, green tea and white wine finishes the session with those unapologetic urges of hemp, chive, verbena and earthy geranium.

Fuller in body, the beer's firm and smoothly bitter grip on the throat is balanced and bitter-sweet. Its soft resinous power of fresh spruce turns to lemongrass and fresh grass clippings before trailing with a dank and tart fruit aftertaste."

602,benzalman,Last Buffalo In The Park,4.52,"Man, this beer RULED when I first had it. Definitely one to drink fresh and not age. Ton of coconut and barrel. I dont hear a ton about FB these days, but this beer was great!"
603,REVZEB,Last Buffalo In The Park,4.29,"Both last snow and this in the same year, neat! Jet black body with a brown head, standard but well done. Huge coconut right away in the nose, bourbon is present but light, get bakers chocolate and caramel more. Taste is surprisingly similar, while coconut laden nose is fun, want more barrel for the taste. Malt work stabilizes the complexion though, with velvet smooth coffee setting in near the finish. The feel is very smooth, but it is light in both body and barrel, coconut defines somehow even more than LS. Like last snow better, but still a nice porter. Coconut fans this one is for you!"
604,LesDewitt4beer,Black Gold,4.7,"2022 bottle split among friends.
L: Pours jet black, no head, very thin edge foam, no carbo, visible clinging of beer to sides of glass.
S: Chocolate cherry Black Forest chocolate moist cake, a hint of coffee, toffee, a halo of barrel.
T: Taste follows nose and is sweet. Chocolate, molasses, bourbon. Deeply roasted flavor without char. There are suggestions of dark berries, raisins, dates.
F: Smooth, silky heavy bodied with a long slick finish. It is very lightly oily.
O: An amazing tasting and drinking beer. Gushing with chocolate cake flavor and is a sipper. Soft bourbon and a silky feel and finish make this world class in its style."

608,micada,Black Gold,4.53,"Not getting much bourbon, but the barrel wood is really coming through. At first it seemed a tad bitter or tannic, but ten minutes or so of breathing mellowed that.
Very easy to drink. Solid all around. Thirty minutes out, there’s more sweetness and a bit more bourbon vibe. The base stout is,
for lack of better description and palate, a savory type, not sweet or chocolatey. Buy it if you see it."

611,aleigator,Kaggen! Stormaktsporter,5,"Närke Kaggen Stormakts Porter 2019

Yields a night black color with a smaller mohagony colored head.

The aromas lead with ground coffee, honey dipped milk chocolate and matured, spicy wood. There is a leathery quality in this, accompanied by lighter licorice and a note of caramel.

Mouthfeel on this is rich, heavier bodied with a well fitting, lower level of carbonation, which manages to unfold a late effervescence.

Taste offers strong notes of bitter chocolate, roasted espresso beans, dried figs and a well nuanced amount of rich sweet chestnut honey. Reveals an intriguing creaminess then with additional camp fire smoke on top, blending well into the bitter chocolate maltiness in this, together with a lighter note of caramel and mansion dust. Finishes with a lingering herb dryness, blending well into the coffee and chocolate bitterness in this, intensified by the warming, spicy and gnarly oak of the beer.

Fantastic, complex and intense with a great balance to it. This is as good as it gets regarding this style of beer with a beautiful, carefully way of crafting a complex, yet elegant beer."

Smooth, silky, light roast, light heat. Awesome bourbon and fudge notes. The maple adds a nice light sweetness that goes well with the heat and roast from the barrels. Toasted marshmallow. Chocolate. Full bodied, great feel. Very surprised with how much I liked this as I haven’t enjoyed hill stouts in the past."
622,Holderness,Beyond Good And Evil,4.56,"L -- Jet black in the glass with a surprisingly robust two finger head produced with aerated pour. Hard to believe this has been bottle conditioning for a year and a half
S -- Waves of rich milk chocolate, wet bourbon barrel, prune, fig, chocolate covered cherries, vanilla, maple, and light smoke. Smells like a pastry stout without being a pastry stout
T -- Incredible how much of a difference 18 months of barrel aging makes over the usual 10-12. The bourbon barrel presence is heavy here -- both in the notes of oak from the barrel itself but also the boozy bourbon heat. Very rich, mapley base stout that has both an espresso/dark chocolate character and a sweet fudginess. The bourbon is just a hair on the hot side
F -- Big mouthfeel, medium- carb. Lasting, sweet finish. Oily and slick, less velvety than expected
O -- One of the best barrel aged stouts I've had. Patience is the name of game when it comes to barrel aging, and Hill Farmstead has it in spades. Very pricey @$25/17 oz, but it's worth it

Taste follows with a dark chocolate bitter, floral vanilla, and balanced boozy bourbon finish. A slight hint of age/oxidation can be detected on the backend, but this has aged/settled in extremely well for being about a year old. The bigboi booziness that you would expect at 17+% is there, but it is smooth and enjoyable...it starts to peek out a bit more as it warms. And, the mouthfeel is darn near perfect. Outstanding!"

633,Thomas_Wikman,Fundamental Forces,4.79,"Fundamental Forces is an Imperial Vanilla Stout from Bottle Logic. The one I drank had an ABV 17.17%, so a little stronger. I guess the Fundamental Force I got was the Strong Nuclear Force, the one with Gluons and Mesons. It's recommended with brownies. I didn't have brownies but my wife suggested oreo cookies but I thought that I didn't need to double it up. This beer is like 8 oreo cookies and that's enough. Maybe a little sweet, but it's good, very good, slightly boozy (well ABV 17.17%) but with all the other flavors that is not an issue.

Look: black with a half inch fluffy mocca colored head

Aroma: chocolate, vanilla, bourbon

Flavor: What stands out is the vanilla, the bourbon, the roasted malts, the coffee and chocolate.

Body/Overall: Full bodied, dessert in a bottle."
634,sjrider,Chocolate Rain,4.37,2021: 20.2% ABV. Bottle pour dark as a moonless night with quickly dissipating foamy chocolate milk head leaving a scant ring of tiny bubbles.

635,bluejacket74,Chocolate Rain,4.47,"750 ml wax capped bottle, 2020 edition, 19.1% ABV, bottled 6/24/20. Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with not quite an inch tan head that didn't stick around for too long. Small amount of lacing. I like the aroma, the brew smells like chocolate, vanilla, bourbon and roasted malt. Taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of some burnt/charred malt, dark bread, oak, molasses and a bit of dark fruit. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's rich and coating with a moderate amount of carbonation. It's a little boozy but doesn't quite seem like it's 19.1% ABV either. I thought this was a pretty good overall brew, definitely worth trying if you ever get the chance!"
636,stevoj,Chocolate Rain,4.5,"750ml bottle at share, 2015 vintage. Near black pour, small beig e head fades away. Aroma is roasty, dark chocolate, boozy with light fruity accents.

637,darktronica,Chocolate Rain,4.08,"2021 vintage, 20.2% ABV."
638,BubbleBobble,Chocolate Rain,4.07,"This one pours a surprisingly thin dark brown that emits a fair amount of light around its edges; brief, cola fizz with no head, retention, or lacing. Nose has a leathery, molasses and salty licorice Black Tuesday backbone melded with semi-sweet chocolate chips. Some vanilla and oak as well. Nothing overpowering, and all the aromas feel like they're integrated into the beer, rather than an adjunct or flavoring that's thrown in on top and feels ""artificial."" Taste follows - it lacks the overpowering leathery and brackish boldish of Black Tuesday, but the cocoa additional doesn't tilt this sweet. Instead, it takes some of the rougher edges off BT while still maintaining an overall ""savory"" (or at least, no sweet) stout. Lots of alcohol, barrel, and bourbon spice lingers nicely on the loooong finish. Plenty of heat as well, but again, not overpowering. I do find the feel a little thing (similar to Gray Monday), but not everything needs the chew of BCBS. I still prefer BT, but this is a fine variant."
639,Rug,Chocolate Rain,3.8,"2017 vintage

It’s been a while, but I’m back with another BIF beer from @Eziel! This guy supplied me with some truly crazy stuff, and I’m hyped to try this one out. I really liked the raspberry cobbler Black Tuesday variant, so I have high hopes for this one too. Let’s dive into it

Pours a surprisingly light muddy brown with a finger of tan head that quickly fades to nothing and leaves no lacing

The nose here is quite pungent, perhaps an artifact of 5 year old vanilla beans and cacao nibs. I'm picking up on aromas of cocoa powder, raisin, dark chocolate, vanilla bean, heavily roasted coffee, hot bourbon, light toasted oak, and molasses

Whereas the nose was charmingly pungent, the taste is a bit sharp and aggressive. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting hot bourbon, burnt coffee, vanilla bean, dark chocolate, caramel, brown sugar, and molasses. The swallow brings notes of hot bourbon, toasted oak, vanilla bean, cacao nibs, black cherry, burnt coffee, toasted oak, and caramel

A full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a sharp and boozy (duh) beer. Finishes dry but with a serious alcoholic heat

Damn, I don't know if it was the age, but I really did not vibe with this one. It's hard to say if it was once well constructed, as it doesn't even really show a shell of what it used to be, save for the aroma. Hopefully the Black Tuesday Reserve he sent me is much better"

Taste -There was a lot of coffee here. Notes of chocolate syrup, and light vanilla we’re also present. It was not overly sweet to the point of being calling and allowing the coffee to shine. The coffee and chocolate continued in the finish.

Mouthfeel - The body was slick and not overly thick with small bubbles.

Overall - This is a great stout that coffee stout lovers will love."
648,57md,Double Shot,4.36,"I usually like to sample a base beer before dipping into variants. However, when it comes to TH, I take what I can get when I can get it. So, I tried the Espresso version of this beer before sampling the OG version that is before me now.

Pours a deep dark brown-to-black color with over a finger of head that is milk chocolate in color. Like the Espresso variant, I am not overly impressed by the nose - some coffee, not much else.

The flavor profile is dominated by fresh black coffee. The bitterness off the roasted beans is the highlight here. The body is hearty and the finish has just enough residual sweetness to counteract the bitter coffee."
649,beergoot,Double Shot,4.42,"Jet black body, opaque; thick, frothy, light brown head, long lasting; patchy splotches of foam stick to the glass. Rich dark roasted malt smell; cacao nibs and bitter chocolate. Rich and flavorful taste; fine blend of sweet and bitter chocolate; chocolate fudge and brownies; bourbon undercurrent; bitter. Heavy body; heavy sweetness throughout with a mild dryness at the finish.

651,Specialmick,Double Shot,4.29,"Look...A black viscous motor oil with a vibrant chocolaty wealth of big and little bubbles of light brown
Smell...A rich chocolate and coffee but faint with a malt back. Molasses and hint of alcohol
Taste...A rich roasty chocolate malt with almost no hint of coffee. I think that the coffee presence has been quelled or reduced by the nine months on this beer. Anyway a complex sweetness and a bitterness that is definitely overpowered
Feel...I believe the best quality of this beer. A pesky fullness with the 8.2% ABV seemingly heavier to me. To me this is the part of the beer that I fin craft beers are so superior to the huge stout boys like Founders Sierra just to name a few . The local varieties have a creamier touch
Overall...This is a sweet stout. I believe the time on this beer (holding it for science haha) has made this beer sweeter than the normal and a practice I would not do to this beer in the future, Still a well made beer but I like a little more balance of bitter. Re-evaluation is in order I believe I liked this beer on the fresher"

Creamy light tan head with some rocks; good cap retention; heavy ring; sudsy lacing on agitation; medium thick legs; black body with ruby see through and good clarity. Bourbon and some mild roast coffee in nose; oak takes over as beer warms. Taste is bitter roast coffee, bitter sweet dark chocolate and oaky bourbon; a smidge of oaky vanilla in middle; black peppery oaky close. Medium body; silky feel, not adjuncty; alcohol burn on tip of tongue, warmth in mouth from 13.8% abv; dry wooden tongue coating/finish. Overall the beer tastes good but it’s too oaky for me; the coffee is bitter and the barrel notes push aside the base, i.e., oak dominates the whole and leaves a dry popsicle stick linger in my mouth."
656,DIM,Parabajava,4.47,"This is drier than most of its peers with a seemingly darker roast coffee as well.

Great mouthfeel, with a gentle sweetness that’s not overpowering and very smooth given the ABV. Absolutely perfect and easily the best BA coffee stout I’ve had."
658,augustgarage,Parabajava,4.51,"Received as a gift from a kind friend - poured from a crowler (filled on 7/31/23 - enjoyed on 8/20/23) into a snifter.

Clear seal brown liquid rests beneath a beige crust, receding to a thin ring and surface slick. Gentle lacing; slick thin sheen of tears.

Chocolate, fine tobacco, molasses, black licorice, cherry pits, black coffee, and brown sugar in the nose - stupendous.

Boozy, oaky, toasty, lightly charred, with perhaps even more flavor (following the nose) in the finish than on the palate. Wave after wave of malt and barrel complexity. Bittersweet and almost but never quite smokey/spicy. Mild bitterness throughout, earthy/woodsy medium-dry finish with hints of black tea and bourbon.

Slippery, almost oily mouth-feel, with some residual tannins.

Forgot how good the base beer can be, and the coffee adds another layer of roast/fruit/bitterness without distracting from the character of the stout. Wonderful example of the style."
659,stortore,Parabajava,4.45,"12 ounce bottle into a snifter. 2022 edition, had 4/13/23.

Pours a mostly opaque dark brown, with a half inch foamy head and some foamy lacing. Aromas of coffee, bourbon, roasted malt, chocolate, oak, some char and cocoa, a hint of cherry. Flavors of intense coffee, roasted malt, bourbon, chocolate, oak. Smooth, a solid full body, appropriately carbonated. 

The coffee is prominent, bold and outstanding. The barrels show well, the base is solid, the feel is great. Will buy this anytime it is available."
660,Rug,Parabajava,4.49,"2022 vintage

When I first tride OG Parabola I quite enjoyed it, but honestly had higher expectations. And I think coffee would improve upon the base beer, so I’m hopeful for this one. Let’s crack open this legendary variant of a legendary beer and see what it’s all about

Pours a very dark brown with 2 fingers of frothy tan head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing

It’s definitely punchy in the nose, somewhere between roasty and bitter white still presenting a nice sweetness. I’m picking up on aromas of cacao nib, earthy hops, roasted espresso, molasses, burnt toast, toasted oak, vanilla, light brown sugar, and tobacco

It trends much more bitter in taste, but that underlying sweetness helps things from getting out of hand. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting molasses, earthy hops, cacao nib, dark roast coffee, plum, rye toast, burnt caramel, light vanilla, and brown sugar. The swallow brings notes of cacao nib, dark roast coffee, burnt toast, toasted oak, black cherry, caramel, earthy hops, light plum, and molasses

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a smooth beer. Finishes dry and roasty

Yeah, this is definitely better than the original, the coffee is just the kick it needs. Maybe I’ll get to try some other variants some day"
661,drdiesel9483,Parabajava,4.37,"Look - love the thick blackness with a nice thick tan head great rimming and lacing
Smell -roasted malt and coffee, barrel slight dark fruit 
Taste -roasted malt coffee dark chocolate barrel, slightly bitter 
Feel -creamy full body light carb
Overall - pretty great"
662,Grax,Parabajava,4.13,"Aroma is boozy bourbon with a bit of classic chocolaty stout -- jammy molasses and plum. Body is strong with bourbon followed shortly by roasty coffee, and the two combine to make something like a mounds bar with a swig of strong black coffee. One of the best examples of a good barrel aged stout out there."
663,pathman,Parabajava,5,04/27/23 bottle @ home
664,REVZEB,Parabajava,4.52,"Pitch black pour with a full brown head. The nose is great: espresso added to usual parabola, but the barrel not cut at all. Taste is coffee and chocolate forward, barrel is rustic, roasted malt parabola base is still great. Body is a touch thinner but still earthy, rustic, and boozy with roast. This is well done but I like the original best still"
665,micada,Parabajava,4.25,"2022 version poured cellar temp to a mug. Base Parabola has always been excellent. This coffee version is good, with a new profile to the base. Gone is the bright, complex, woody bourbon up front. That has been replaced with a milder, more chocolate front. The middle is “Parabola” in body and flavor. The coffee comes into play as a mouthfeel factor and an end-sip lingering dirty cup of Joe. It’s a decent coffee flavor. It’s slightly odd to me that it comes into focus so late in the flavor. No alcohol burn, and really not much warming as one might expect from this big ABV bomb. For my money, I’d stick with base Parabola or the Anniversary offerings."
666,Braunmeister_1943,Notorious Triple IPA,3.88,"Poured from a 12 oz can into a teku.

L- Semi hazy pale golden color.

S- Dank resinous piney hops.

T- Bold citrus and pine flavors. Boozy.
Alcohol almost overpowers the taste.

F- Dry, tannic mouthfeel. Moderate 
carbonation.

O- The overpowering abv and booziness 
kept my score for this one on the 
low side."
667,Pivopijak,Notorious Triple IPA,3.77,"draught
Medium orange, with amber highlights, for the look. Solid amount of toasted grain, caramel malt, tangerine peel, for the aroma. Lots of tangerine peel, caramel malt flavors. The extra malt, tames the hop bite, as usual."
668,NCSapiens,Notorious Triple IPA,4.16,"Hoppy and piney, with bitter grapefruit that counterbalances the alcohol sweetness from the tripe IPA makes it surprisingly drinkable for 12% abv."
669,LiquidAmber,Notorious Triple IPA,4.4,"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a medium coppery amber with a two finger white head with great retention and solid lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, citrus and piney hops, orange, mild mixed tropical fruit and pine;a touch of green onion. Flavor is lightly caramel malt, citrus and piney hops, tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, mixed tropical fruit and pine needles. Medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess. So great to find an traditional triple IPA with real malt flavor, lots of fruit and pine and substantial bitterness in the finish. I was struck but the mild sweetness of this one, but with all the mixed fruit it fit perfectly. Some hotness, but plenty of flavor to cover the ABV well. Boneyard has always pleased with IPAs and I'm not sure why I've never seen this one in my area before. I'll be looking for it in the future. Excellent."
670,TheBricenator,Notorious Triple IPA,4.46,"Look: Nearly clear rich orange with a reddish hue and the pour yields a thick pure white head that pillows up and slowly recedes, leaving great lacing behind
Aroma: I could smell it before I got close to the glass. Sweet orange, peach, strawberries, pine sap, cantaloupe, a little Cannabis, rich honey-like sweetness, ruby-red grapefruit, Hawaiian bread, tangerine, and an ever-so-slight ethanol waft
Taste: Whoa. A huge rush of mixed citrus fruits storm onto the palate as honey-like sweetness and berries start to mix in. Pine and dank herb appear from time to time and malt sweetness is ever-present and closes with a big hop bite and alcohol heat
Mouthfeel: Full, slick, slightly cloying but far from palate-taxing, and decently dry on the finish along with some alcohol heat
Overall: This is a big-time beer and a good one at that. This was my first time with this beer in years and was pumped when I saw they had finally canned it (or packaged it at all) but glad it’s not around often as it’s a huge Triple IPA and it shows. Tons of hops, tons of malt sweetness, boozy, and unabashedly so - you know it’s big but doesn’t drink like it’s 11.5%. A well done and tasty IIIPA. Recommended."
671,PhineasMcClintock,Notorious Triple IPA,4.35,"Growler filled 10 days ago in Portland and arrived in MA.
Not filled super high on the neck, but carb was super solid.

673,MattBeer,Notorious Triple IPA,4.11,"Wow. Usually double IPAs are too strong for me. This is a triple IPA. And yet it is delicious! It is incredibly strong, but you have to expect that. It's like drinking port, if port was really really good and tasted like an excellent IPA."
674,tekstr1der,JJJuiceee Machine,4.5,"This series aren't my absolute fave from TH, but of course still world-class sauce that is an order of magnitude greater than most other brewers of the style. Just fantastic across the board, pretty much dead on to the brewer's description."
675,Rug,JJJuiceee Machine,4.38,"Canned 11/10/23. “Be kind” stamped on the bottom of the can

This Tree House trip brought me some more of the top 250 TH beers. It’s been a while since I’ve had anything this highly regarded from them, and Imm happy to finally tick it off. Let’s crack it open and find out what it’s all about

Pours a hazy yellow gold with 3 fingers of soapy off white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing

The nose is an interesting combination of gentle and dank. I’m picking up on aromas of grapefruit rind, white grape, dank weed, bready malf, lime zest, resinous hops, and overripe cantaloupe

It’s surprisingly smooth and balanced in taste but I really dig it. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting orange zest, overripe cantaloupe, crackery malt, grassy hops, dank weed, mango skin, pineapple juice, and white grape. The swallow brings notes of orange zest, lime zest, white grape, jammy peach, bready malt, grassy hops, dank weed, and mango skin

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a smooth beer. Finishes mostly dry with a balanced bitterness

This is a great way to start tbis Tree House haul. I wouldn’t quite call it top 250 material but happy to have tried it nonetheless"
676,jrc1093,Sunday Brunch - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.26,"2023 vintage; consumed on 9/25/2023

Pours a silky, jet-mahogany body capped with two and a half fingers of soapy, beige foam; solid head retention leaves a slim-none cap over an otherwise dense void, paper-thin collar, and minimal, temporary webs of lacing holding to the walls of the glass.

Aromas of fragrant coffee abound, sporting a vanilla inflection and subtle roast atop a delicate maple saturation; a deft cinnamon edge presents through the back end of the bouquet while a soft bourbon inflection lingers.

Taste features airy cocoa touched with coffee roast, with a touch of vanillins imbuing a char revisited over the mid-palate; soft maple settles into the back end, informing heavy dark cocoa into the finish as supportive cinnamon fades through the swallow.

Mouthfeel offers a medium body and moderate carbonation, fading as subtle roast coats and a slick, balancing texture washes over the mid-palate; creaminess into burgeoning warmth settles through the back end while a wispy, semi-bitter prickle finishes.

Expressive coffee welcomes sleek vanilla, with bourbon simultaneously softening roast and mediating a beautifully deft cinnamon accent; an expertly done combination of adjuncts, layered over the profile approachably and with purpose."
677,MutuelsMark,Sunday Brunch - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.71,"All high ABV porters should be bourbon barrel aged in my opinion. This one is and well done. Super dark in color with a light brown head. Nose is bourbon and caramel. Taste is like toasted cane sugar and caramel. The slight burn from the ABV is not overwhelming, yet has a bit of hang around power. The feel goes all the way down the esophagus."
678,Felgenlager,Sunday Brunch - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.67,9/2/2018
679,wisrarebeer,Emperor Julius,4.21,"Typical higher ABV highly drinkable Treehouse beer. Soft, full, some alcohol presence in mouthfeel but highly quaffable. Nose had an unusual astringency but otherwise a good beer."
680,BEERchitect,Emperor Julius,4.24,"Never resting on any past victories over the tastebuds, Jullius sets his sights on new conquest with even stronger hop power. Backed by the Tree House clan and new conquests are ahead.

Turbidly hazy and cast in a pastel golden taupe appearance, Emperor Julius slowly separates from the ale with an ivory mousse of froth. As its musty fruits rise from the foam, notions of tropical fruit, citrus, stone fruit and melon carry an over ripened yet juicy scent. Sweeter on the tongue, the full flavor and textures of poundcake, honey and dough all smoothen out the early palate.

As the lusciously hoppy ale rolls along the middle palate, the tastebuds are awaken with the tropical flavors os papaya, passionfruit, mango and pineapple with a citrusy followup from grapefruit, tangerine and lime. All wrapped in the juiciness of cantaloup and apricot and the fruit flavors are nearly complete. Seemingly macerated and over ripened in their taste and a transition to an herbal, peppery, grassy and damp sod bitterness is seamless.

Full bodied, creamy and richly malted to the palate, a full bed of cereal is too much for Julius to overcome. An attempt to overwhelm with hops comes with exposures of earthy, dank and vegetal bitterness that gives rise to his foes. As the ale finishes malty-dry and bitter-sweet, the session lacks refreshment or drinkability, albeit still quite good."
681,LifesAnesthesia,Emperor Julius,4.59,"L - Opaque, hazy golden/orange with a soft offwhite head that dissipates somewhat quickly leaving behind a good amount of lacing 
S - Floral/grassy, piney hops along with tons of citrus and malt 
T - Follows the nose: orange bomb up front and throughout intermixed well with piney, bitter, grassy hops 
F - Full bodied, light to moderate carbonation. Soft, fluffy, smooth. 
O - an orange DIPA bomb and a fantastic example of a NEIPA"

Powerful aromas of hazelnut coffee, chocolate, dark chocolate and maple syrup.

Tons of vanilla, marshmallow, chocolate, and bourbon. The taste follows, with massive amounts of vanilla leading the way. Just a lovely viscous stout."
692,woemad,Modem Tones - Bourbon Barrel-Aged - Vanilla,4.56,"12oz can courtesy of Dimidiata. Been sitting on it for a bit, and decided it would be an excellent Valentine for myself.

Poured into a snifter, it was the color of the mood of Philadelphia Eagles fans right now. Virtually no head besides a very thin line of tan bubbles around the rim. Not a great looking beer, but it's not surprising considering how strong it is.

As expected, it smells like a big Stout brewed with the adjunct ingredients of vanilla and bourbon barrels, with an unexpected touch of what smells like Graham crackers. Smells like a luscious dessert.

Tastes like it smells, but better. It's not a subtle beer, but you don't drink beers like this for subtlety. The bourbon Barrel flavor is fairly mellow and refined, and the vanilla is at a level that melts well with that, unlike a lot of beers I've had with vanilla added to it. That Graham crackery thing I noticed in the nose is present in the taste as well. I do not believe any graham crackers were abused in the making of this beer, perhaps it's a byproduct of the vanilla and bourbon mixing. It is utterly delicious, that's for sure.

Fairly creamy mouth feel, body is somewhere between medium and full.

This is a glorious dessert beer. Perhaps also my last from Modern Times. But, hey, they're going out on a high note with me. Thanks, Christine!"

T: Absolutely heavenly and smooth with the flavors mentioned under the smell. Does not feel like an 11% ABV beer, yet you get the effects afterwards. 
F: Thick, smooth, and luscious. 
Overall: This is the best Imperial Stout that I've had and it's not even close. I first had this in 2021 during the warm weather months and it's truly better than even KBS."
696,Roguer,Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.32,"Very good head production, but retention is lacking, fading to only the thinnest possible ring around the rim of the glass before long. Body is a lovely obsidian hue, cola-like along the edges.

Aroma is quite strong, prominently featuring the bourbon. Notes of bourbon mash, brown sugar, oak, leather, red grape, cherry, coconut, syrup.

Flavor absolutely delivers on a classic, BCBS-like BBA imperial stout. Lots of bourbon, but not overpowering; moderate char; bitter, but not overly hoppy nor too roasty, coming across on the more restrained side of RIS. Toffee, ginger cookies, raisin, coffee, prune, bourbon, oak, leather, white pepper, blackstrap molasses.

Exceptionally easy to sip, savor, and chew, despite the ABV and barrel influence. Does finish fairly hot on the back third, letting you know just how big it is.

This is an excellent BA RIS, with tons of complexity and an admirable restraint on all fronts. It's supremely drinkable, and less rich than most others, without sacrificing flavor. That said, I personally wish it delivered more richness along with that complexity, perhaps just a touch more sweetness and thickness. I also favor AIS over RIS, which certainly influences my take on this one."
697,Ozzylizard,Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.23,"Plead the 5th from Dark Horse Brewing. 12 oz can. Stored at 34 degrees at home. Received from @Whyteboar in NBW BIF #16. Reviewed 05/12/22. Note that I use DD/MM/YY protocol.
Undated can. Served at 53.4 degrees in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. The final temperature was 57.7 degrees. 
Appearance – 3.5.
First pour – Amber Brown (SRM 18), clear.
Body – Brown (SRM 20), opaque. Under direct light, same. When rear lite, opaque except at the edges – bottom edge ruby, top edge olive. 
Head – Average (Maximum 1.2 cm, aggressive center pour), buff, high density with a few surface rocks, quickly diminishing to a 0.1 – 0.15 cm crown and a thin island.
Lacing – None. Not much expected at 11% ABV.
Aroma – 4.25 – Chocolate, weak char, and some hints of bourbon. No hops, no yeast.
Flavor – 4.5 – Chocolate and slight char with a slightly bitter aftertaste. Bourbon not detected. Slight oakiness. No hops or yeast. No ethanol (11 % ABV as marked on label) aroma or taste. Moderate gastric warming occurs. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl. 
Palate – 4 – Medium, dry side of creamy, soft but lively carbonation.
Final impression and summation: 4 (After deducting 0.25 point for undated personal container) Look unremarkable, pretty much like every other high ABV RIS or Impy stout. Aroma is fairly typical but has a char note that many lack and lacks the coffee notes that many have. Bourbon is present on the nose but seems absent in the taste. The taste also has both chocolate and char as well as an oakiness from vanillin but lacks the tannin notes. As the temperature reaches the end, some bourbon notes finally appear. Overall, a good RIS that’s certainly more subtle than most."
698,NCSapiens,Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.18,I had a 2016 and was curious what 6 years of aging would do. Definitely mellowed it out a bit and knocked off the rougher edges. Mostly left with a mellow oak and vanilla bourbon flavor over a nice toasty base stout. Quite nice.

Prominent barrel notes of bourbon and oak abound, along with present coffee and hints of smoke...rich and sweet on the palate, the barrel-aging seems well-executed here. Definitely worth trying, I liked this variant more than the Vietnamese coffee version; this one just seemed more cohesive, roasty, rich, and pleasant."
703,DokiDokiLitFam,Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.6,"2022 Version

Pours out a very dark brown. On a straight pour, very little foam is agitated out. 

Nose is oak, roasted malt, and a peppery quality. Almost like rye spice. If I didn't know any better, I'd say that this was a rye barrel aged stout. Or perhaps even a rye based stout. 

On the taste, however, there is more of a story. Oak and bourbon come through first on the palate. Behind that is the roasted malt bringing a dark bread note and a beautiful dark chocolate the sings throughout. I picture an overdone rugelach with a dark chocolate filling in my minds eye with this brew. The only sweetness being from what little is in the dough and the mildly sweetened chocolate. While the oak shows up quickly, it dims down as the palate progresses, and the more subtle flavors appear. Like a tide retreating to show the rocks that sit beneath. 

Mouthfeel is fullbodied but not oily or cloying. It has heft, but not the residue that often accompanies. There is drying for sure, most likely due to ABV and barrel tannins. The carbonation is considerable too, for a stout at this percentage. Mild compared to most anything else, but surprising in this regard.

Overall this is what I expected from Alesmith. A respectful, expert brew. The base brew is a hallmark; an example of how often ""less is more"". The barrel aging brings it up a notch while still maintaining that level of composure and elegance. I had no doubt that this would be a world-class offering."

Flavors of bourbon, coffee, roasted malt, vanilla, oak, some chocolate, light caramel. Has a decent amount of hop bitterness. Smooth, a solid full body, appropriately carbonated.

706,jrc1093,Curiosity Thirty Two,4.33,"Canned on 7/5/23; consumed on 8/12/23

Pours an opaque, sunflower-orange hue capped with two fingers of creamy, eggshell-white foam; great head retention leaves a finger of frothy cap and dense collar, while a generous spattering of spotty lacing coats the walls of the glass.

Aromas of ripe mango are accented with guava zest and pineapple husk, with orange oils informing a peppery dank as a creamy, floral build settles through the bouquet.

Taste brings mango bubblegum into notes of orange and mango as white pepper stimulates an earthier aspect of peach zest over the mid-palate and Orange Tang invigorates the close.

Mouthfeel shows a medium body and a moderate spritz of carbonation, levying a subdued bog to a drying prickle past the mid-palate toward a back end both subliminally resinous and coyly juicy.

An initially tropical amalgam explores myriad hop subtext in a turn toward swampy, earthy rinds before reinvigorating a brighter, cleaner base; a sampling of the Tree House IPA profile at its most comprehensive form."

Decently strong aromas of orange, grape, tangerine and a touch of lemon zest.

Taste follows. Has a sweet white wine vibe going on. Citrus and hint of lemon. Nice earthy, bitterness on the back of the sip.

Full-bodied, thick soft mouthfeel. Slight dry stickiness on the swallow. Lingering bitter aftertaste. Low to medium carbonation.

S - But I loved the sedate almost not there/but there aroma. Citra singular slightly fruity, slightly resiny but not over hopped with respect to rest of the beer. 4.25

The taste follows that script, with the mango and tangerine most prominent and delicious, with the lemon zest and white grape lurking, and some sweet oats at the back of the palate, coasting into a pillowy mouthfeel and a surprising bit of lingering bitterness.

I like this more than Julius. Yes, I typed that. World class stuff here."

718,jrc1093,In Perpetuity,3.9,"Canned on 6/30/23; consumed on 7/11/23

Pours an opaque, dark orange body topped with multiple fingers of thick, fluffy, eggshell-white foam; great head retention leaves a half-finger of cap, large collar, and a dense walling of chunky lacing surrounding the glass.

Aroma opens to a waxy Nelson-dank accented with white grape pith as a flaky cereal grain undertone expands; hints of white peppercorn ease through notes of musty lemon and grass on the back end of the bouquet.

Taste brings mandarin peel, grapefruit, and an underlying hint of key lime as musty white grape meets lemon bubblegum over the mid-palate and a flaky grain lingers on through the profile.

Mouthfeel shows a medium body and moderate carbonation, dispersing tautness into silky textures as a slight creaminess prevails, leaving a glossy fade through resinous undertones on the finish.

A steady, well-attenuated dankness rife with tropical overlay; a standard NEIPA in the ever-quaffable Tree House rotation."
719,dcotom,In Perpetuity,4.53,"Poured from 16-ounce can into a thin-walled crystal goblet. Hazy pale yellow, with a two-finger white head that left scads of pretty lacing. Big burst of grapefruit upon opening the can, and it only got better. Loads of grapefruit, orange, and tropical fruit on the nose and palate (think breakfast juice). Very low bitterness, with hints of citrus zest lingering on the finish. Satisfying mouthfeel, very juicy. Well balanced and very drinkable, i.e. goes down easily and you just want to keep drinking it. First time with Tree House, and I'm suitably impressed. Highly recommended."
720,erosier,In Perpetuity,4.64,"Pouts a very hazy yellow-orange color with a thick white head that laces the glass a lot as it fades slowly. Smells of sweet malts, melon, citrus. Tastes of big citrus - orange, grapefruit, lemon, mixed with melon and a hint of toasted malt there at the end. It's lighter than it feels, crisper than it looks, perfect amount of carbonation, a sleeper in the Treehouse line of New England IPAs. Worth it if it's there."

T: Tropical and citrusy, but also grassy and even a bit earthy. Mango, tangerine, strawberries and white grapes. THs trademark bubblegum sweetness is very present in the taste as well. Bitter finish, slightly zesty.

F: Full and juicy. Smooth and a bit creamy. Proper carbonation.

Cigars! Something leafy and woody yet smoky, too…
After an intoxicating nose, this turns into a wrestling match between three big flavors: candy sweetness, oily bean, and wood smoke. 
The maple is tree more so than syrup, the bacon is just smoke + salt rather than any mouth-watering savouriness, and the coffee’s just dropped out a bit. 
In the end the big sweetness doesn’t hang together with a whack of tannins + a couple of threads of dark roastiness. 

A lesson in not aging adjunct beers, but also not necessarily better than the regular strength version."

Moving right along from the incredible Maple Bacon Coffee Porter I had last night, we now have the imperial version, with an extra 3.1% abv. Maybe the flavors will integrate even better in this beefier beer. Let’s crack it open and find out

Pours completely pitch black with a finger of light tan head that fades to ring and leaves minimal lacing

Yeah it really is similar to the base beer in the nose, just bolder. I’m picking up on aromas of sweet maple, medium roast coffee, dark chocolate, toffee, smoky bacon, and burnt caramel

It definitely tastes fuller, and in turn less abrasive than its base. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting sweet maple, light roast coffee, cocoa powder, black cherry, salty bacon, and light caramel. The swallow brings notes of maple syrup, smoky bacon, burnt caramel, medium roast coffee, tobacco, brown sugar, and light vanilla

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a slick beer. Finishes mostly dry with a balanced sweetness

724,zac16125,Blåbær Lambik,4.35,"Pours crystal clear, dark ruby with almost purple hues. 2 fingers of dense pink tinged head builds and hangs around forever. An essentially perfect appearing beer. Aroma has a huge minerality, only mild lactic tartness, subtle pungent funk, not much fruit. Taste is burnt plastic like funk, some bitterness, moderate tart sourness, blueberries are subtle. I poured the sedimentation in a separate mini glass, it has huge blueberry aromas and was much sweeter and richer, a blueberry cobbler character almost. The taste was a little more tart and a little more blueberry forward but still not a ton. Ok back to the main pour. As it warms it opens up a bit like a good wine. Fruit comes out a bit, and lactic acidity builds but still never reaches the mouth puckering tartness of most Cantillons. It’s very clean, crispy even, with a high but appropriate carbonation and very good drinkability. Overall, a very nice beer. Is it worth the hype/hoops one needs to jump through to obtain it? The short answer is probably no, but hell it was fun anyways.

A: Pous crystal clear, copper in color, moderate sized bright white head dissipates quickly leaving no lacing. Looks still in the glass’s 4.25

S: Aroma is immediate raspberries, hay and raw wheat. Initially quite floral which then cedes to funky notes of slightly pungent cheese. I can’t say that it smells particularly sour, but there’s some lactic tartness and citrus rind. Quite complex and a wonderful nose. 4.75

T: Taste follows with a big plastic like funk up front, which quickly yields to floral and citrus notes, with big oaky vanilla on the finish that lingers forever. Taste is quite tart and sour but it’s not as puckering as many lambics. The raspberry characters are present but certainly not prominent, not sure to what extent that’s due to the age. 4.5

M/D: Mouthfeel is lighter side of medium bodied with a big but appropriate carbonation and incredible drinkability. I could drink this all day. 5

O: A wonderful beer no doubt. Not sure if it was worth the difficulty in obtaining as I think I prefer Cantillon Rose de Gabrinus when it comes to Raspberry lambics (and I’ve surprisingly found the other easy to get over the years).

Pours a cloudy orange gold with 3 fingers of soapy off white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing

The nose is vibrant and tropical, but there’s a nice bitter hop character to it as well. I’m picking up on aromas of orange juice, lemon zest, overripe cantaloupe, floral hops, bready malt, gooseberry, dank weed, dried blueberry, and light grass

And it manages to keep up that wonderful balance in taste too thankfully. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting overripe cantaloupe, pineapple juice, bready malt, grassy hops, blueberry candy, dank weed, and light orange zest. The swallow brings notes of orange zest, gooseberry, crackery malt, dank weed, grassy hops, pineapple juice, overripe cantaloupe, and light grapefruit zest

Light touching head, with ultra fine bright white bubbles. Lots of pill like lacing and even leggy. Island creamy top with a soft shape, sitting on a slightly hazed dark lemon, with hints of noticeable fast rising carbonation.

A bold nose. Dank hits of earth and must hop, but also a real tropical passionfruit like flavor. Hits nice and spicy too, with a bevy of hop explosive power. Nice and diverse but just misses the wow factor, and other beer character balance.

Palate is just real nice. Juiced up and filled with a rich malt coating, hop flavoring of passionfruit, pineapple, and a real jammy like texture. Coats a little chalky but also brings a real nice spicy earthy hop bitterness on the finish. Good notes of tropical variety too, guava, mango all sorts of fruit tropical goodness.

Pours completely pitch black with 3 fingers of dense dark tan head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing

The maple honestly isn’t even the first thing that jumps out at me in the nose, opting for a thinner maple profile to support the other adjuncts. I’m picming up on aromas of dark roast coffee, sweet bourbon, milk chocolate, maple sap, burnt caramel, molasses, charred oak, and light vanilla

It’s also not extremely maple in taste, but it is unfortunately a bit sweeter than the nose led me to believe.

I guess I ""should've known"" because I am not a coffee beer fan. I don’t like coffee in my ice-cream or in my beer. 

The beer itself tastes like a adjunct stout with added coffee and roasted dark chocolate. It mostly taste of molasses though. Sorta reminds me of a cup of shoefly pie in a glass. It tastes rich and hearty and probably has a equivalent of a loaf of bread in it.... but I've had much better ""imperial"" stouts from other brands which didn't need to adjunct and add coffee to the beer.

If you like coffee in your beer then go for it. If you want a ""normal"" stout then stay away."

Anyway, poured into a pint glass at about 45f. Pours pretty extremely dark brown to black, with a khaki head that lasts for a minute or two until it recedes to a thin film and a ring that leaves nice lacing. 
Smells of coffee and baker's cocoa.
Taste is malty chocolate forward that is dry and then the coffee hits and lingers there, ending it sort of an ashy smoky finish that resembles raw baking cocoa mixed with coffee grounds. Not sure where the ""Oatmeal"" in this oatmeal stout is supposed to have a time-slot... Kinda overwhelming on the coffee.
Mouthfeel has medium carbonation, but lacks the smoothness that some other stouts have.
Overall, a medium heavy beer that is very coffee forward, and I think even has a bit of caffeine in it, which I don't care too much for unless I am to wake up and drink it every morning, which I'll admit that it's Thanksgiving today and I'm staying home alone, so this beer is being served for breakfast.
Pretty good brew, but I won't be buying this one all the time.. too much adjunct flavors that take it too far away from the category of simple ""Oatmeal Stout."""

Pours a cloudy medium reddish brown with a finger of soapy light beige head that fades to a ring and leaves decent lacing

It's funkier than I imagined, with a uniquely soft brie that fills the nose before accenting touches of buttery white wine and nutty oak develop.

The palate crisps it up with tart pear and slightly overripe and dried apricot while toastier oak develops in a way that somehow conjures up honey representations.

And so the pursuit comes to a conclusion, in a way such that, for me, elucidates how the biggest names in Hill's wine barrel aged saison collection are not the pinnacle in their catalogue, while still clearly have contributed to some beautiful blends, like Clover, as well as honed their experience in pursuing other expressions, like Samuel, Work's of Love (Monk's Café, Cigar City), and more.

758,M-Fox24,Art,4.49,"A: The decanter tinges vermilion on the initial impact, which transfers to a vivid – metallic – orange. That luminosity tops a deep saffron base with a pastel orange hue, as gamboge tones streak throughout. Proportionately, an askew cap that comes to a vista white inch, while steadily downsizing to the ½ in, where the palette succumbs a snow drift highlight. The configuration has the hydrophobic polypeptides & bitter acids to modestly cling, when retreating to the ¼ in. At this point, a latticework with a residual nuance to dimly stick, as the retention retains an enacting solidity. Albeit, shy on the aesthetic decree, seeing the descending collar to the minute. The layouts have a transparency upon the transfers, which have an opulent appeal early on, while a circuitous convention develops amid the pressing radiations

S: A density set to esters, as they constantly web around the oak casks, while the grain bill pitches a smart rusticity. There is an isoamyl octanoate innuendo near the persuasive peach accompaniments, which takes a Torani Syrup form. In this respect, a softly tart & fuzzy recording that’s lightly backed, by the oak tannin exchanges, while the hop effect lends a floral regularity. The phenolic compounds gradually characterize on cobwebs, aside a ripened mustiness, given the vintage works over the decant. However, a narrow presentation on the inaugurating course, as the directive is more symphonic to the seeds and skins above the alluding crops. The advancements have a stronger denotation on the aged strains with a grain bill that ties in pit + trench silos, while maintaining a profitable presence on esters. Markedly, a harmonization amongst the ranching & pastoral foregrounds to the milder fruits ascribing pears, berries, and apricots. Moreover, an undercroft ease on the °F upticks, while a dry Torrontés similitude dispatches, besides the barrel aldehydes. The cessations retain an earthed ruralism against the – loitering – eugenol structures, beyond the leathery tannin constitutes

T: Fermentable complexities with a soft cask neatness, which traits ethyl acetates to porous oak codas. Namely, an oxidized kindliness that has a solvent growth under fresh clingstone peaches, which impute seedy connotations per the inferred pits. The French oak barrel offers mild spices to complex polymers, where phenolic aldehydes pitch vanillin. Meanwhile, malt backs the bready accounts with Dorset knobs & pie crusts, as hops back a longleaf pine essence, while ketones casually mingle. Chiefly, an inducement on raspberry ketones alongside strawberries & melons, before connoting emerald drop pluots. A buildout on fleshed fruit to palm syrup, as catacomb dust delicately descends on Golden Silk Spiders. Coupled with, cattle yard atmospheres to leathery tannins, as a transferred aridity elevates above the rustic granularities. The timing to weather – over the course – reverberates that inaugurating solvency thru an Oloroso Sherry implementation, which offers an oxidative nuttiness to exotic thickets. On the rear side, a perceptible murmur on cloves & nutmeg, while guaiacols quietly coat the codicils over smoke, as polyphenol compounds dictate

M: There is a passing rain to flagstone texture, from a minerality component that later transcends on seafronts. The surface is soft with calm acidic natures, given the modest vivacities, which attenuate steadily. In consequence, a dry formation that benefits over the cask scriptures, when depicting the hydrolysable substances

O: Yeast grandiosities that are perceptively backed across the bitter – earthy – hop effects, while phenolic companions lurk. On balance, a sensitive malt mannerism with a loyal intention to not annihilate the course, as the French oak barrels impress. The timetables are advantageous to the vintage over an improved dryness, from cut sugars to cranked up/interconnected esters"

The aroma is of chilies, rum, and coffee. I’m tasting chilies, vanilla, cacao, and rum. The mouth is warm from the chilies and otherwise chewy."
766,HardTarget,Pirate Bomb!,3.61,"12 oz. bottle, marked 07/27/19, sampled 05/09/21. A little long to wait, bought it off the shelf 3 weeks ago, so the brewer takes any hits on aging, they left it there for purchase. 

Appearance: Black glass, thin halo of tan bubbles, no lacing.

Aroma: Heavy vegetative chili note, burned barrel, some underlying malt sweetness.

Taste: Medicinal alcohol, green pepper, some sweetness comes in deep into the taste, a little coffee in the finish. Hard to get many ""beer"" flavors out of this, even imperial stout flavors. Some pepper burn long after the swallow that builds a bit.

Mouthfeel: Medium heavy body, low, almost flat carbonation, little oily in the finish but pretty clean.

Overall: I love Prairie bombs, I've enjoyed a lot of the variations, this one not so much. I think all the additions overwhelm the yummy base beer, and it just comes across as a little gimmicky. The vegetable note really throws me. Maybe this one sat too long, the date code is all but invisible on the bottle."
767,Smakawhat,The Greenest Green,4.46,"Poured from the can into a Spiegelau IPA glass. It's so green Dec 4th 2023.

Turbid with a bit of a hinting shiny body, but fast carbonated with murky yellowish tinge. Classic bright solid white cap, four to three fingers thick and rich and not budging on the glass at all.

Very interesting hop aroma. Spicy and thick, hints slightly dank and pungent with mushy pineapple and strangely as well with what seems like pickle brine. Large amounts of earth and soily sweetness that hits like a smokey wallop.

Delicious palate. Chewy tasting, with a flavor that feels like mint chewing gum and tropical hop richness. Minty warm, with pungent aromas on the palate hinting pineapple and vanilla, giving a touch of pina colada like quality. Minty and nice soft bitterness that melds wonderfully on the finish. Reminds me somewhat of ice cream in flavor with the texture.

Quite a fascinating IPA. Kind of wish the fruit character was a little more pronounced and dominant, but there is little to complain about here."
768,Darkmagus82,The Greenest Green,4.4,"Poured from a can into a teku glass 
Appearance – The beer pours a super hazy deep orange color with a two-finger head of white foam. The head has an amazing level of retention, fading slowly over time and leaving a ton of foamy lace on the sides of the glass. 
Smell – The aroma is heavy of a tropical fruit smell with tons of papaya and mango, as well as a good showing of tangerine and pineapple. At the same time there is a thick bready and doughy smell as well as notes of apricot and nectarine. Hop aromas of grapefruit and herb are rather intense and with some raw hop smells and a bit of yeast, a very inviting and intense aroma is produced overall.
Taste – The taste starts out with a sweeter and more malty start with a big showing of the tropical fruit flavors (tangerine, orange, pineapple, and mango) that were in the nose. There is also a lightly toasted and very bready malt flavor that has hints of a smooth oat and grain. There is a strong presence of hop from the start as well, with a massive grapefruit pulp and rind flavor paired with floral notes and a bit of herb. The floral and the herb, get more intense as the taste advances, getting up to the strength of the grapefruit hop. All the while the sweetness fades a tad, all while a bit of must and hay comes to the tongue. At the very end, a raw green hop taste joins in, and with the other flavor transitions, one is left with a juicy and fresh hopped taste to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is very thick and chewy with a moderate level of carbonation. Fantastic for the flavors and the style, making for an indulgent, slow sipper.
Overall - Big, rich, and fresh. A very well-crafted brew and one to seek out if you have the opportunity."
769,tekstr1der,The Greenest Green,4.44,"No clue how such a strong and flavorful NEIPA can be made so smooth and creamy to consume.

771,BEERchitect,The Greenest Green,4.49,"Growing greener and greener than ever, Tree House brewers take the decade of hop learning and applies it to an imperial New England-styled IPA that takes Green where Green has never gone before.

Not quite ""compost-green"" in color, The Greenest Green's viscous haze ebbs and flows into the glass taking the appearance of tarnish yellow grapefruit and orange juices- perhaps with extra pulp. As its seductively creamy head builds, its juicy, tantalizing and irresistible fruit aromas spring forth with the vibrancy of exotic citrus and tropical fruit punch- but however with its own curious herbaceous bouquet. Creamy, poundcake-like and full with cereal, its seemingly fructose taste offers a fruity tanginess that evokes teeth-churning behavior in the very first sip.

And as the taste blossoms across the middle palate, its secrets reveal, layer by layer. Fruity sweetness begins to drift while the tropical fruits rise to the forefront- first the pineapple, mango, apricot and passionfruit. With full hoppy saturation mounting on the tastebuds, the acidity of ripe tangerine, lemon, lime and gooseberry turn to a dry sherbet flavor for complexity and charm. Not to be outdone, its smooth bitterness is balanced and sharply acidic with an undertow of chive, fresh grass clippings, shallot and cannabis.

Working both the creamy and dry segments in mouthfeel, the beer is juicier than ever while trending flavorful, fruity and piquantly resinous. Finishing with a sappy pine flavor, the beer's overwhelming hop complexity completely seduces the palate and easily makes the palate forget about the bitter and caramelized taste of imperial American IPA gone by."
772,sjrider,Grey Monday,4.31,"Bottle pour - dark as night with short, quickly dissipating khaki head leaving a ring of tiny bubbles. Nose is sweet with cocoa and molasses, boozy barrel wood and hints of nuts. Taste follows more or less, definitely getting alcohol creep that lingers on the finish. A cold weather sipper."
773,Rug,Grey Monday,4.31,"2021 vintage

I’m an absolute sucker for hazelnuts in a Stout, and when I see that The Bruery has one, it’s an instant buy. Plus it’s also another top 250 list tick. This is a big ass bottle that I’ll likely be attacking all night so let’s stop wasting time and get right into it

Pours a very dark brown with 2 fingers of light tan head that quickly fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing

Right off the jump, there isn’t much hazelnut present in the nose, but it’s still interesting nonetheless. I’m picking up on aromas of molasses, earthy bourbon, peat smoke, sea salt, cocoa powder, toasted hazelnut, dry oak, light vanilla, and raisin

The hazelnuts definitely express a bit more in taste, though they still aren’t exactly at the forefront. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting cocoa powder, earthy bourbon, toasted hazelnut, toasted oak, black cherry, burnt caramel, vanilla, sea salt, and smoky tobacco. The swallow brings notes of dark chocolate, earthy bourbon, toasted hazelnut, sea salt, peat smoke, sea salt, molasses, dry oak, burnt caramel, and light vanilla

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a slick beer. Finishes mostly dry and drinks significantly below its abv. Like literally less than half and that’s easily the most impressive part of this one

I struggle with this one. It’s definitely not top 250 material, and the adjunct isn’t really the star, but on the other hand it’s (dangerously) drinkable and pretty unique. Worth a shot for sure"
774,darktronica,Grey Monday,4.2,"750mL bottle, 2021 edition sent to new Society members under their new nationwide shipping policy. Very little difference from the base Black Tuesday, if I'm honest, having had regular BT many times but this being my first Grey Monday. That means it's excellent, but the hazelnut treatment is pretty muted at this point (if it was ever more prominent), yielding a slight generic nuttiness with a touch of additional sweetness. It's not Nutella, that's for sure. It also suffers the same shortcomings of the standard BT, being very thin on mouthfeel for the ultra-high ABV and pretty hot on bourbon heat once it warms up a bit."
775,BubbleBobble,Grey Monday,3.76,"Pours a very dark brown though with moderate light clarity on the edges. Fizzy cola head that quickly dissipates to a thin ring. Nose has a hint of hazelnuts right off the bat before giving way to big waves of whiskey and rum, molasses, dark soy sauce, barley, oyster sauce, and vanilla. Flavor is a little tough to place. Heat - both warming booze and sharp ethanol - pop right away. There's significant salinity that's different from Black Tuesday - less deep, blackstrap molasses, more brackish sea spray or even oysters. Malts, soy sauce, black licorice are there, but with less intensity than BT. The nuts come forward as it warms, and though it's hard to definitively place hazelnuts, they would be a guess along with peanuts and hazelnuts - definitely nothing too fatty like a walnut. Mouthfeel is remarkably thin for this kind of beer (I'd call it ""moderate""), especially when compared to BT or a BCBS. That's not bad per se, but I think the feel contributes to the overall heat and sharpness. This was interesting - though I'm not sure I'd be keen to shell out for another bottle."
776,bluejacket74,Grey Monday,4.47,"750 ml bottle, bottled 05/31/19, 19.2% ABV. Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch tan head that didn't stay around for too long. Not much lacing, either. I like the aroma, the brew smells like bourbon, vanilla, fudge, hazelnuts, brown sugar and roasted malt. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's the addition of some burnt/charred malt, caramel and earthy/oaky flavors. It's a little more roasty/bitter tasting than I was expecting, but that's not a complaint by any means. All the flavors seemed well balanced with no one flavor overpowering the others. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's slick and a bit rich with a moderate amount of carbonation. And as with most of the Bruery's big beers, it's not as boozy as you'd expect it to be. I thought this was a good overall imperial stout, definitely worth trying if you get the chance!"

The beer pours very little head and the beer itself is a dark brown color with a bourbon like appearance.

The smell is good. It has a nice mix of a sweet alcohol note and sweet hazelnut.

The taste still has the hazelnut note but the chocolate is more forward and dominates the taste alongside the alcohol note.

The feel is good. It has a heavy body with very little carbonation and a slight burn at the end.

Overall, a good beer worth getting and drinking fresh instead of holding it for a while."
779,patre_tim,King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,4.16,"Pale, yellow, thick and juicy looking, so hazy, you can’t see through it! Topped with one finger of fast dissipating, white head. The smell is of orange, citrus, a hint of pine. Certainly not as pronounced as I was expecting. The taste is very fruity and juicy, like a perfect refined, orange juice, with a hint of dank Ness, and an abundance of tropical notes but all very muted. Light and foamy, feeling body, very smooth! I’ve been anticipating this brew for a long time I got it at beer hub in Waynesville North Carolina and I’m drinking in Maggie Valley August 12, 2023. I must admit the hype around this set my expectations quite high, and it is a great beer. However, not nearly as perfect as I was expecting. But certainly worth searching out."
780,Whyteboar,King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,4.29,"Poured the requisite opaque yellow orange with a growing manilla colored head. No floaties to be seen.
The aroma is lost on my Covid damaged nose. Stupid Covid.
The taste was a tale of two beers- at first it was magnificent with citrus notes and a hint of piney pith. I’m thinking this is awesome!
Then I let it warm up a bit and it shifted to a dryer, more pithy taste. No idea why, it was still really good, just not magnificent.
The feel is solid, smooth and no chunks of anything. Easy quaffing.
OA, good, nay, great DIPA and I may get more. Or I might just stick with regular King Sue."
781,Lucular,King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,4.05,"Draught pour at Champps Americana in Brookfield, WI.

Smell...A burst of orange, pineapple, pink grapefruit, mango, and all types of floral aromas. a dank grass is fielded by the dry hopping imbibing a pungency
Taste...Orange bitter pineapple express with the dank hoppy bitterness with the dry component i believed caused by the dry hopping
Feel...An astringent juice feel with a sticky convergence of foam . Great carbonation launching a good fullness. 
Overall...This beer I tried today for the 4th time is one of the elite beers i get to try. Sometimes a beer just hits you and says WOW and this for me has that quality. King Sue its close cousin I felt the first time i had that too!! If you see this beer and like unfiltered DIPas you would be a fool not to pick this up.

791,JohnniEMc,Upper Case,4.23,"The pour that emptied a pint can's contents into a clear glass liter mug produced that nearly stark white foam that bears witness to a wheat inclusion. The foam recedes unevenly, unattractively and in this case, slowly. The body is dull apricot-amber, approaching murky. In short, it looks like the typical modern American IPA. Thankfully, it smells much better than it looks. There's at least a sharp citrus/pine noting to the hops. A malty counterbalance, not so much. The description of the taste is basically a repeat of the words used for the smell. The 9% ABV is noticed, as it adds to the hop bite, but not as a detriment. Also, there's a little more starchy sweetness than predicted by the nose, but it's shallow. Taste references would be pineapple and lemon, backed by a good earthy hop bite. The mouthfeel is average for the style, maybe just a little better for something that carries this much alcohol. There's some stratified glass lacing that enhances its looks. Overall, for something that obviously has wheat in its wort, this isn't bad, especially for one that hits with such potency."

Ruby red pour with a small eggshell white head that eventually settle into surface islands. Smell is exactly what was promised: sour cherries and classic JK farmhouse yeast, barnyard funk, and a touch of lemon peel all with a kiss of vanilla. Taste switches the vanilla and lemon intensities, funk is milder but now get some hay, genera supporting red fruits, and a touch of earth. The best new world take of this belgian classic I have had in a long time. Feel is tart, mildly acidic but more so funky, medium bodied and very smooth in a cooling fashion"

Shortly after having the legendary Atrial Rubicite for review #1900, I have another highly acclaimed Wild Ale from Jester King for tonight. They have a knack for fruited Wild Ales, so I'm betting that this one will be a home run. Let's pop it open and see what it's all about

Pours an opaque reddish purple with a finger of pinkish white head that quickly fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing

The nose is actually rather subdued surprisingly. I'm picking up on aromas of tart cherry, lemon juice, sharp oak, brown sugar, vanilla, red wine vinegar, and graham cracker

Things liven up much more in taste, amping up both the tartness and the sweetness. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting tart cherry, sharp oak, cranberry, brown sugar, tannic red wine, wet hay, lemon zest, old leather, and light raspberry. The swallow brings notes of tart cherry, graham cracker, tannic red wine, sharp oak, old leather, toasted walnut, vanilla, jammy raspberry, lemon juice, and wildflower honey

A light medium body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a sharp beer. Finishes mostly dry and refreshing

Another winner from Jester King to absolutely nobody's surprise. Dammit, all this Jester King lately is tempting me to visit the brewery some day"

Taste is layered for both depth and length. Initial cherry flavor is rather sweet but then turns tart. Oak throughout. Earthy funk. Brief appearance of spice, with a longer interval of vanilla. Sweet and tart in the aftertaste, which fades away rather slowly.
Medium mouth feel, with a touch of syrup. Some drying in the finish but not a tooth scraper.

O: A top shelf Trappist beer. Brisk, fruity & fairly sweet but not cloying. It's a sipping beer. Taste & feel are magic. Take your sweet time to enjoy this quadruple. It is world-class in its style."

822,barneyrubble,Trappistes Rochefort 10,4.82,"Love the light brrown head and dark copper brown color

Nose has brown sugar and raisins along with some banana

Taste is fruit bread, a bit of brown suggar and dark malt and a touch of banana

Feel is slightly less than full bodied and with a nice dry almost tea like tannic finish

Overall just great, more thoughts to come wiht the next trial of this great beer."
823,brap,Trappistes Rochefort 10,4.93,"Delicious. Caramel, chocolate, and nuttiness make it taste almost like a dessert but with enough alcohol to prevent it from being too cloyingly sweet—a great way to end a great meal. To be sipped and savored.

Also, it is very consistently excellent. I have revisited this beer repeatedly, and it feels like a revelation every time."
824,TooManyGlasses,Trappistes Rochefort 10,4.55,"Christmas dinner - had before but somehow never rated here.
In glass a dark reddish brown with a big fluffy khaki/tan head with a little bit of an aggressive pour…
Aroma is a wonderful mixture of caramel, brown sugar, dark fruit, fruit cake and some notes of chocolate; sense of the alcohol.
Deliciously smooth minimally sweet caramel, toffee, some molasses on the palate - again hints of chocolate and some spice and dark fruit.
Moderately full mouthfeel though not syrupy, bright carbonation with warming silky booziness. 
Absolutely delicious and timeless quad."

829,DuaneL,Pseudo Sue,4.25,"I understand that the world thinks this is a practically perfect Citra ale - and I do not necessarily disagree, but to rate it as 99 is over-doing it a bit! First of all, this is not a pale ale, it is an NEIPA! And as that I rated it accordingly above - I couldn't rate it as a pale ale because that's not what it is. It is a lovely beer but I find that after a pint I wouldn't be able to drink more because the sweet aftertaste of the ale is somehow cloying, can't describe it any better than that."
830,Spike,Pseudo Sue,4.37,"On tap at North Bar, Tribeca, NYC. Fantastic NEIPA with an even more fantastic low ABV. Looks like orange juice, tastes super juicy with a nicely piney backdrop, is perfectly bitter, and is very easy-drinking. Need a lot more of these."
831,LifesAnesthesia,Pseudo Sue,4.62,"L - Hazy yellow with a frothy white head that sticks around leaving behind a ton of lacing 
S - Tons of bright, piney hops along with tropical fruit notes with some cracker malt 
T - Bright, piney, bitter hops up front and throughout intermixed well with citrus - grapefruit primarily - and tropical fruit notes 
F - medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Soft. 
O - a pretty fantastic APA"

833,mntlover,Pseudo Sue,4.46,"Pours a hazy pale yellow with thumb sized white head that laces well.

Aroma is big citrus notes bright and inviting, pale malts light pine notes. Great nose for a pale ale could be anyone else's IPA.

Taste is like the nose big hop flavors riding on a pale bready malt base. Huge citrus notes with some light pine bitterness also. Nice crisp and clean with a lighter lingering bitterness.

Mouthfeel is lighter and crisp, light tingle from the medium carbonation level.

Overall a very nice pale ale that has a better hop level than many peoples IPA's"
834,nasal,Pseudo Sue,4.41,"This is a difficult beer to rate, for me personally. The smell is brilliant and showcases all the complexity of fresh hops. It really calls to mind the sticky, pine-y resinous quality of a fresh hops harvest. The first taste is all balance - a very malty beer, although barely roasted so it has a kind of familiar macro beer maltiness, with lots of hops. The hops flavor is everything I love about hops. It's bitter, but also showcases some of those green-forested and citric qualities of hops, which were promised by the smell. I wasn't expecting it to be quite so balanced. That's where I struggle to be objective, because for ""what it is"" it's nearly perfect. However, the paleness of the malt, coupled with the intensity of the malt flavor, leans too close to bad memories of Budweiser/PBR/Coors for me personally. The aftertaste is gently bitter hoppy and malty, not cloying or awfully-dry-and-bitter, not too sweet and nothing artificial. I love this. I really do. For me, though, it's like Zombie Dust with a few shots of Budweiser in it. I am happy to recommend this beer to anyone, although if I knew someone who has only tried Budweiser and therefore hates all beer, it wouldn't be my first recommendation. Personally I prefer Zombie Dust. This is infinitely better than all the macromicro (New Belgium, Goose Island) type beers combined. However, due to Zombie Dust being a bit more affordable in my area, I am not sure I see myself revisiting it often. Would I happily drink this next summer? Of course!"
835,Cory149,Pseudo Sue,4.86,"Served on-draught from a local bar.

Bursts with wonderful citrusy brightness, tempered by a well-balanced bitterness. Excellent, rich mouthfeel without being too heavy. The perfect beer for almost any occasion - great entry for consumers of macro lager into the craft world."
836,JohnnyNoIPA,Pseudo Sue,5,This is an outstanding Citra hop pale ale. It is somewhat delicate in the body with a mild to strong bitterness at the finish. The hop aroma of citrus is very strong and the added hint of mango give this a very refreshing taste. Color is bright with just the right bite!
837,ZebulonXZogg,Abrasive Ale,4.31,"Not quite a clear golden color, soapy white head and some greaat lacing. Nose says fruit, citrus, maybe some mango. Nice bitter finish but smooth. Really nice beer, don't see much Surly here."
838,Tsar_Riga,Abrasive Ale,4.43,"A - Pours out a hazy copper-orange color, super fluffy off-white head, persistent, with lots of small gauge bubble lacing.

S - Strong hit of pine and citrus in the nose, some resin and Citra-brand funk on the tail end.

T - Lovely blast of lemony citrus in the front, an undercurrent of grapefruit comes forward with juicy maltiness through the middle, pepper spice and pith coming forward to a sharp, assertive bitterness in the finish.

M - Super easy to drink, smooth and clean, with moderate weight and an ABV completely hidden, closing with enough dryness to invite immediate return for more.

O - I'd heard about this one for years, but just had never had a chance to get Abrasive until I moved here. Glad to make its acquaintance. I'll be picking this one up again when I get the chance."

T - big citrus (mainly pink grapefruit), bitter floral notes, a little pine, peppery spice, quite fruity, heavy malt backbone (but the bitterness never lets up); bitter, complex, and enjoyable!

M - bitterness bites all the way through, smooth full body, average carbonation

O - an excellent DIPA from Surly!"
840,Bouleboubier,Abrasive Ale,4.4,"(16 oz can, canned on 11/18/22, F5670; purchased 4-pack off shelf at Shangy's... poured into a fat tulip)

L: slightly-hazy medium amber-colored liquid; not a huge head on the pour, but it's tight with a frayed cotton contour... only holds a thin collar, thin misty cap; does leave a big band of lace oppo of sip spot

S: very floral initial pop (rosewater), followed by some fleshy orange pulp, lemon/grapefruit zest, background hint of pine... a little honeyish malt wants to poke through... gummy orange slices... only a soft essence of alcohol... excellent overall intensity

T: citrus kiss, but a rush of florality right behind it... the aftertaste is spicy, with a green bitterness that slowly swells... certainly a big malty base, with a muffin/cakey quality, but it's sodden with hop resins... vague dried pale-colored fruit (apricot, sultana) slowly creeps into the aftertaste, while the residual bitterness grows some peppery hair to it... the volume on the bitterness just keeps increasing, speakers cracking and shaking; hop artifacts emerge

F: its bitter bite takes hold on the tongue, mildly intensified by the ethanol, which sets and singes (and yet cools?!) a touch near the back of the palate... its body and resins make for a silky lusciousness up front, giving way to a growing heat; soft carbonation

O: why did this take so long to be released out east here(?), especially considering Furious had been here for years now; this was the first Surly beer I ever heard of c. 2011 (though Darkness and Bender weren't far behind)... I am going to try the next can in a pint, which they're website suggests is the preferred vessel... aggressive and comforting (2081)"
841,gcasher,Abrasive Ale,4.85,"I am so happy to have finally found this locally (PA) after searching for it for years. It did not disappoint. While the can is over a couple of months old, the ale still tasted very fresh. I rate it as having a NE flavor profile while having a west coast appearance. It is translucent and golden, but definitely not cloudy. The head was white and not too foamy. The aromas came in waves of sweet fruit. The flavor came in waves and it seemed each one was a different type of tropical fruit. What a fantastic drinking experience. The only downside was the $5 price tag, but that would be a bargain in a tavern."
842,defunksta,Abrasive Ale,4.29,"Canned 11/7/22 (1 month ago)

Appearance: Pours a slightly cloudy (80% clarity) medium orange color with a strong white head. SRM of 9. (4.00)

Aroma: Strong aromas of rich grapefruit, tropical mango and melon. Resinous, earthy, and tropical. Some tropical peach evolves as it warms. (4.25) 

Flavor: Flavors follow the nose with strong tropical grapefruit, pineaple, mango/melon with a sweet peach undertone. A moderate balance of sweet and smooth caramel balanced by bitter pine notes. (4.25)

Feel: Heavier bodied, strong carbonation and finishes sweet, but surprisingly clean and drinkable on the palate. (4.25) 

Compared to Revolution Anti-Hero IPA 12/2022: Pours lighter, stronger aromas. More juicy grapefruit, tropical pineapple, melon, and peaches. Less resinous nectarine and syrup. Juicier, but also more balanced with pine bitterness. Winner: Surly

Compared to Surly Axe Man 2/2023: Pours darker, hazier. Stronger aromas. More sweet and juicy tangerine and peach. Less dank berry and pine notes. 
11/2023: Pours darker, more rich and tropical flavors. More dank and bitter. Heavier, but more flavor overall. 

Compared to Great Lakes Ancient Arctic 12/2023: Pours hazier, milder head. Stronger aromas. More dank grapefruit, orange, pine, melon. Less sweet overripe grapefruit, orange, and fruit punch. More bitterness and flavor. 

Overall: Wow a surprisingly fantastic IPA here. Grapefruit, tropical pineapple, mango/melon, and peach flavors. Juicy with enough pine and grapefruit citrus rind to balance. Beldns NEIPA juicy flavors with west-coast body and mouthfeel. Sort of reminds me of Half Acres IPA blends and not unlike Axe Man in many ways. I hate imperial IPAs as the alcohol and sweet malts ruin the hop flavors and IPA bitterness nearly every time. This one may be the exception. It's has big juicy orange and tropical melon/berry flavors with a resinous pine bitterness off the end. Sweet, but nicely balanced by bitterness. An imperial WCIPA that packs enough bitterness. Fantastic. (Rating: 4.29)"
843,REVZEB,DFPF,4.39,"Pinkish magenta cloudy body with a pinkish cap. Tart and sweet passionfruit in a good berliner with notes of cracker, lemon, wheat and salt in both smell and taste.

Fun and regional emphasis, refreshing even, not the most complex but it delivers what is promised"

Well I wasn’t expecting Bayberry to have the BA highest rated Berliner Weisse on tap for their 6th anniversary party, but I’m hyped that they do. Let’s get into it

Pours a clear ruby reddish with a finger of pinkish red head that quickly fades to a thin ring and leaves minimal lacing

Honestly the nose on this one isn’t anything too impressive. I dig it but it’s a bit sweet. I’m picking up on aromas of cherry candy, passion fruit, pineapple juice, crackery malt, lemon zest, light dragonfruit, and vanilla

Oh no, I stand corrected, that is much better in taste. Nicely tart and well balanced. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting passion fruit, underripe mango, lemon juice, apricot gummy, straw, apple cider vinegar, dragonfruit, and tart cherry. The swallow brings notes of lemon juice, pineapple juice, dragonfruit, cherry candy, crackery malt, underripe mango, and a touch of vanilla

A medium body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a a crisp beer. Finishes slightly sticky but the feel isn’t ruined by it

Brewers Notes: Collaboration with J. Wakefield Brewing

We took our original J. Wakefield collaboration Affogato Imperial Stout and aged it in bourbon barrels for 6 months at our Hudson Road barrel house. Affogato Imperial Stout is inspired by a few of our brewers' favorite summertime pick-me-up (& cool-me-down) Barrington's affogato.

Barrel Aged Affogato Imperial Stout is decadent, rich and full. Brewed with a blend of Barrington & Mostra beans, Affogato leads with aromas of vanilla, toasted marshmallows and subtle notes of bourbon. Barrel Aged Affogato has a full, satisfying body and an indulgent palate of vanilla cream, hot cocoa, rich brownie batter, with complimentary doses of smooth coffee and bourbon.

MALT: American 2-Row Barley, Crystal 120, Flaked Oats, Black Malt, Chocolate Malt, Munich Malt, White Wheat Malt, Brown Sugar, Dark Candied Syrup, Lactose

851,JohnniEMc,Susan,4.87,"Golden amber with a modest and enduring off-white head, a full clear pint glass full just spilled out of a tap head. As with many hazies, this doesn't punch the nose, but it is pleasant. There's a pleasant starchy backing for resinous hops, which aren't at all that bitter to smell. There's a near perfect softness to the mouthfeel, just like a hazy styled AIPA should provide. Unlike too many others, it's neither too thin, nor too sticky. The same goes for the hopping. It, too, is close to perfect for the style. It's vaguely resinous, with a hint of a spice like lemongrass, coriander or pepper. With some nice glass lacing, this also looks close to perfect. Overall, this is one incredibly good beer. Outside of New England, this is a rare find. When it shows, beer geeks are on their phones to their buddies and it doesn't last long."
852,jngls,Susan,4.82,"One month old. Can to wine glass.

L: Pours an opaque golden brownish orange with a fluffy white head that leaves a good amount of lacing. No floaters.

S: Hoppy and slightly malty with notes of ripe orange, honey, pines and stone fruits. Herbal and grassy.

T: Malty with caramelly and bready notes on the one side, hoppy with a fruity sweetness on the other side. Honey, peach and a bit of pineapple.

F: Crisp and crushable with a medium carbonation. Soft and smooth.

O: I think I've never had a beer with less than 8% ABV that was as complex and flavorful as this one. Even though it drinks almost as crisp as a lager, all kinds of malty and hoppy notes keep popping up. Absolutely outstanding."

Alright, it’s time. The highest rated American IPA on BA!! I’ve been wanting to try this one for quite some time, and I’m thrilled to finally get the opportunity to. I’ve been seeing more Hill Farmstead beers near me as time goes on, and I’m excited by all of it. Let’s see if it can truly live up to the hype

Pours a lightly cloudy orange gold with 2 fingers of creamy off white head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves nice lacing

The nose is somewhat delicate, for lack of a better word, but still shows an excellent balance of all of its elements that ends up turning out really nice. I'm picking up on aromas of orange zest, pine sap, bready malt, grassy hops, honey, pineapple juice, white pepper, grapefruit zest, and light orange marmalade

In taste it falls a little bit flat of the complexity on display in the aroma, not exactly one-dimensional but more focused on bitterness. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting grapefruit zest, piney hops, bready malt, weed, white pepper, honey, light passionfruit, and pineapple. The swallow brings notes of crackery malt, white pepper, piney hops, fresh cut grass, honey, grapefruit zest, passionfruit, and light orange

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a slick and sharp beer. Finishes mostly dry with a firm bitterness

While I think this is quite good, it's nothing mind blowing. There's better examples of the style out there, but I'd also like to try this fresher one day, as I've heard HF can be really particular about the best by dates on their IPAs"

Taste follow...coffee, milk chocolate, vanilla, dark chocolate. Really well balanced and distinct.

Here we have yet another BA top 250 beer that I was able to pick up on my latest run to Tree House. This one eluded me for quite some time and I’m happy I was finally able to grab a 4 pack. It’s a fairly straightforward Milk Stout with basic adjuncts but Tree House tends to excel at that. Let’s dive right in

Pours completely pitch black with 2 fingers of frothy dark tan head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing

There’s a delicate balance in the nose here that is just wonderful. I’m picking up on aromas of medium roast coffee, sweet vanilla, black cherry, cocoa powder, raisin, brown sugar, dark bread, and a touch of leather

While not quite as masterfully balanced in taste, this is still damn good. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting milk chocolate, light roast coffee, brown sugar, caramel, raisin, vanilla creme, dark bread, and light toffee. The swallow brings notes of black cherry, milk chocolate, medium roast coffee, vanilla creme, brown sugar, raisin, burnt caramel, and dark bread

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a silky beer. Finishes a tad sticky but it doesn’t hurt the drinkability

865,BEERchitect,La Fosse,4.49,"Taking inspiration from famous Brussel's apricot sour ale, Side Project is brewing more like pros when brewing and aging their own unique spin on the fruited gueuze style.

La Fosse brings a golden tinge to an otherwise bubbly champagne pour. But the beer strikes the nose with force as the overwhelming sour scent tightens the jaws and wets the whistle with fruit, funk and fauna. A scantly sweet introduction is of light wafer, sourdough and a brief hint of taffy.

But anything seeming sweet is short and succinct on the middle palate. The session quickly favors the stone fruit with a light orange, mango and peach character. Shying away from fruit rollup, the beer quickly trends vinous and winey with sharp chardonnay, bubbly dryness and a piquant spice. Its bracing acidity washes any thirst from the palate as the late taste brings an earthen tone of balsa, burlap and extended wood-age white wine.

Light, crisp and highly refreshing, the ale is a cleaner taste compared to more Brussels brewed versions, but this brighter, cleaner and fruitier version is just as good."

A&S: The beer's appearance is bright orange at first and moves to a muddy orange as the remaining beer and sediment are poured in. The head is fizzy and big, there is some lacing. The aroma is powerful! Chalky yeast, tart peaches, and apricots.

T&M: The taste is acidic, fruity, tart, and lemony. Very clean. Cereal finish. Tartness is cleared out when the sediment is poured in and the funk comes through more than before. The high carbonation is champagne-like at first, then comes in a little more creamy later on.

Overall: It is one of the better beers I have ever had. Perfect for a warm summer day."

A: Pours hazy golden amber with a frothy off white head that settles to a light layer and laces nicely. 

S: Ripe tropical and stone fruit, a little melon, bright juicy citrus, green resinous grassy notes, a little pine, a touch of spice, faint earthy herbal notes, biscuity malt, and caramel honey sweetness. 

T: Plenty of ripe tropical and stone fruit, pineapple, passion fruit, peach, apricot, mango, cantaloupe, and a hint of guava, juicy citrus, tangerine, lemon, and grapefruit, a little pine, resinous green grassy notes, a touch of spice, a little earthy slightly herbal undertone, biscuity malt, and caramel sweetness. 

M: A touch on the fuller side of medium body, slightly prickly moderate carbonation, yet creamy smooth.

O: I had this one for the first time last year and was so utterly underwhelmed that I figured it was an off batch or something must have happened to it in transit. No way could my experience be so far off from such a normally highly regarded beer, so I vowed to give it a second chance as soon as I saw it again. 
Really glad I decided to give it another chance, this can is completely different experience and much more along the lines of what everyone else has said about it. There's still a bit of a herbal earthy tone that I'm not in love with that is holding me back from scoring it higher, but it is significantly less pronounced than it was in my previous can. 
My overall impression: They pulled just about everything there is to pull from Mosaic hops and paired it with a ridiculously smooth malt base. I wouldn't mind the earthy herbal side being minimized a bit more, but I'd happily buy this one again."

I was very pleased to find this beer locally and equally happy to drink it. The beer brings a nice, delicate overall flavor to the beer, is not overbearing with acidity or tartness, and goes down well on a mid-summer day.

877,Benish,Oude Geuze Golden Blend,4.46,"Peach color. Classic wild funk at the nose with a little mineral; taste very robust, citrus, maybe aged cheese, complexity beyond what I can describe. Very heavy carb. Aways a treat opening a lambic!"

Awesome."
879,Sheppard,Oude Geuze Golden Blend,4.57,"Pours a hazy golden, not in an IPA way, but a regular beer way. Frothy looking head. Fresh cut apples, some meyer Lemon on the nose. Sweet, champagne-like cider notes up front that is confronted by some sharp acidity. It is, overall, the right amount of acidity with the acidity presented in a very nice way. This is really nice, as advertised."
880,Holderness,Oude Geuze Golden Blend,4.25,"L -- Golden amber body with a slight haze and a half finger of sudsy white head produced with aerated pour. Some retention and minimal lacing. Looks less cider-like than a lot of lambic
S -- Green apple candy, barnyard funk, dried floral, hint of herbal hop. Just super rustic and lambic-y
T -- Has that rustic, barnyard, funk-forward lambic thing going on again, but with a nice dose of lemon candy and oak
O -- Essentially a more refined version of 3F's standard gueuze 

85/100"
881,Falcon91Wolvrn03,Oude Geuze Golden Blend,4.17,"Look – A light amber color, with a nice head.

Smell – A pleasant tart smell with barnyard funk, oak, hay, and a light hint of vinegar.

Taste – Has a nicely dry tart flavor, very similar to the smell. Pleasant, but seems somewhat plain.

Feel – Nice carbonation, with a bit of tartness.

Overall – A very nice gueuze. One of the best I've tried, though that may not be my style."
882,MonDak_Joe1953,Hommage,4.47,"375ml green bottle. Corked and caged. Label has the bottling date as '07/01/2020' and good until '10/26/2040'.
Final dregs clouded up the dark cherry red body. Brief fizzy head but rising bubbles keep trying to form a ring. No lacing.
Aroma of raspberry, cherry, oak funk, and a little barley and wheat grain.
Taste is tart with raspberry, cherry, and oak funk. Some level of sweetness too. Underlay of barley and wheat malt. Quick exit in the aftertaste.
Medium mouth feel, with a bit of nectar. Drying finish, and some tooth scraping (acidic). Supportive carbonation.
The oak aging has resulted in an excellent blend of raspberry and cherry, along with the fermented malts. All exist on a naturally higher plane."

885,champ103,Hommage,3.7,"A: Pours purple/blood red color. A small pink/white head forms initially. Though that recedes quickly with little lace. That color is really stunning though.
S: Aromatic and tart berries and cherries up front and center. With an unmistakable earthy funk. There is a bit of oak and vanilla here as well. A really pungent and sharp aroma that I enjoy.
T: Oh boy, that sweet tart berry/cherry mix is there. Which becomes super acidic and sour. That funk, light oak and vanilla is there as well. Which tries to help balance. Though that acidic sourness becomes a little to much and makes this unbalanced for me.
M/O: A medium body that has a nice crisp bite. Really well carbonated. Definitely some sweetness as would be expected, but finishes with a dry bite as well. Pretty classic for the style, but still its slow going. That acidity takes over to much.

I love 3 Fonteinen, and this is a good example of the style for sure. Though it is unbalanced for me. There are other Fruit Lambic's that I prefer over this, but still you have to acknowledge that this is exactly what they wanted to make, and I do enjoy it. Just not love it as much as others in the style, or even others from this same brewery. I would recommend this, if you enjoy intense flavors, especially sour acidic cherries."

887,SpeedwayJim,Saison Bernice,4.03,"750ml capped bottle into a Side Project snifter. 

Pours a bright sunrise. Foamy 2 finger white head. Sparse lace, thin, slick legs. Nose is acidic stone fruit. Light vinegar, dried prunes, apricot pit. Beer opens white vinegar, old stone fruit pit, and dried plum. Foam, wet wood, and apricot pit towards the end. Cobwebs, hay, and a tart funk at the finish. Body is light with ample carbonation. Prickly on the palate and goes down lively with a long aftertaste."
888,JohnnyHopps,Saison Bernice,4.79,"Appearance - The beer was an orange, yellow color with visible carbonation and a half inch of head. 

Smell - the nose was citrusy, but you can still detect farmhouse funk. It tickled the nose nicely.

Taste - At the front, I detected lemon, and other citrus fruits. Notes of grass and green apples were also present. The funk balanced the fruit flavors, making for a well-balanced version of the style. 

Mouthfeel - The viscosity allowed the profile to stick to the tongue and roof of the mouth, even with high carbonation. 

Overall - I may have a new favorite saison."
889,Sabtos,Saison Bernice,4.54,"Somehow eluding me for over a decade, despite several trades with SARA locals, my first draft pour at Good Vibes 2023 appears lightly hazy maize yellow-orange with a dense khaki foam blanket that retains well.

This exhibits a surprisingly solid funk that's as if oaked, as well as some aged cheese that's cut by an apricot-lemon tartness accented by a refreshing hint of lime. 

The fairly crisp body finishes just dry in the swallow.

I can see why this is so well-regarded."
890,turfy,Saison Bernice,4.52,"Superb appearance in the glass…bright golden yellow color with extremely fine, delicate white head. Aromas of Brett, lemon and grassy hay. Taste is a burst of lemony tartness and funk. A very light, delicate mouthfeel with spritzy carbonation. Just about a perfect saison in my book."
891,augustgarage,Saison Bernice,4.21,"Poured from a capped 750mL bottle into my Troubadour tulip. 

Nearly clear Arylide yellow body with a steady stream of micro-bubbles. Off white cap disappears rapidly. Almost no lacing, nor legs. 

Subtle complex yeast-driven aromatics suffused with poolish, fresh cut hay, and stone fruit. Floral, with a whisper of white wine/champagne. 

Bright with a balance of light grain/malt, tart meyer lemon/unripe pear, and a faint peppery/barnyard edge from the Brett. Light clean bitterness with a touch of alfalfa and clover. Long, medium-dry finish reveals full maturation and synergy of ingredients. 

A bit thin and fizzy with lingering acidity. What meager roundness is present seems almost (but not quite) chalky. 

Excellent aroma and flavor, a core expression from the brewery, but the body is more like a lambic than a saison - perhaps this was not a great bottle/batch, but at the price point I'm not eager to roll the dice again right away."
892,Sparty1224,Saison Bernice,4.7,"Brief Review:

O: My first SARA beer here, very lucky to grab this from SF on a trip this past April. Been hearing a lot of great things about them for years. Really digging this. Very clean, light, complex. Just a slight funk, not overly tart. Great carbonation and mouthfeel. Don't have much to compare it to from the brewery, but as far as saisons and wild ales go, this is certainly top notch.

Recommendation: Definitely on par with some things I've had from HF, this is a really good beer from an awesome brewery."
893,MonDak_Joe1953,Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,4.46,"16oz can. No dating information found, and the label recommends to ""DRINK FRESH"".
Impenetrable, black colored body. Short lived mocha brown head, leads to a mild surface storm and thin ring building.
Aroma is German chocolate cake, with sweet vanilla and coconut.
Taste is richly sweet, with flavors of chocolate infused raisins and prunes. Sweet vanilla and coconut emerge mid to late.
Chocolate syrup mouthfeel. Higher ABV% is warming but well hidden. Quiet carbonation.
Very good rendition of German Chocolate Cake."
894,Powderhornphil,Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,4.35,"Very happy to find this on the shelf. I have wanted to try it for years. 

Pours very low carb with very little to no head. Black a little bit oily appearance. 

Nose is coconut. Chocolate. Vanilla. Taste follows the nose. 

Moderate bodied for the style. 

A bit below expectations, but still very good."
895,REVZEB,Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,4.26,"Pitch black body with a pinky finger of light brown foam. Smell and taste are clones: big coconut burst to start, followed by huge vanilla before baker's chocolate, lactose, and malt round out. Feel is sugary on the finish, but very smooth and cohesive in bring it all together, cool and dark in the heavier body. Did not meet the hype, but a good dessert stout nonetheless"
896,dafla67,Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,4.46,"Pours pitch black. Dense. Aroma is intense sweetness. Dominated by cocoa, chocolate & vanilla. Taste follows nose with a hint of coconut. Medium body. Great stout."
897,SpeedwayJim,Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,4.84,"16oz. Can into a Side Project snifter. 

Pours pitch black. Dense. 0.5 finger mocha head that collapses and leaves stringy, patchy lace. Nose is chocolate, vanilla, fudge, and cocoa powder. Super aromatic. Dense. Beer opens milk chocolate and cocoa powder. Vanilla, sweet cream, and fudge in the middle. Hints of toasted coconut and more milk chocolate and cream at the end. So simple but the flavors are executed perfectly. Body is medium with medium to low carbonation. Slick and sticky without being heavy. Dry finish with a long aftertaste. 

The beauty of this beer is the fact that's it's packed so full of adjuncts but comes off as neither too sweet or too heavy. Perfectly balanced."

899,mschrei,Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,4.64,"Long time want, and really worth it. Sweet and boozy. Roasted malt with plenty of cocoa and vanilla notes. The coconut is not as strong in comparison, more assertive on the nose. Slightly thick, a little oiliness on the feel, but big bodied and boozy. Excellent, well balanced, and flavorful."
900,unclekeith,Double Barrel Jesus,4.75,"2015 bomber into a tulip 
About as pretty a beer as I’ve ever seen. Pitch black with a 1-finger khaki head leaving lovely lacing. 

Nose is roasted malt, chocolate, vanilla, bourbon. On the palate- more roast and much heat followed by a long oaky finish. Huge body. Thick and creamy. Great old school big BBA stout.

240th beer on the BA Top 250. Surprisingly hard to track down."
901,Bouleboubier,Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,4.38,"(12.7 oz bottle, 6.9% abv, bottling date 26 JUN 18; purchased single off shelf at Benash today... poured into a Sapwood-branded wine glass almost identical to the stemmed vessels shown on 3Fonts website)

L: cloudy, amber liquid; persistent razor collar, but little foam upon pour.. looks like puddle piddle

S: classic, wet, glassy-grassy aromas... damp earth, spidery spice (must and mist)... just textbook, but missing some chlorophyllic zip

T: leathery-malty, funk-drenched, pizza-crusty (herbal, baked, earthy)... musty lemon pants persists... too booming bold on all fronts... arresting mound muncher, wow!... hints of sherry in the aftertaste; building, mounting... faint acv dank, but not zippy acidic

F: sloppy smooth, slightly sizzly... thick slide with some sultry heat... not the levity I crave with a gueuze, but it'd fit nicely with light, greasy meats or seafoods

O: a lot of dirty, brash, antique slosh... it holds up too well after 5 years here, but it shows subtle signs of becoming a relic raunch... I'd get bottles of this now at this age and price --- DO IT!!! (2238)"
902,HattedClassic,Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,4.59,"The beer pours a very bubbly white head that dissipates very quickly. The beer itself is a clear brownish orange color that looks nice.

The smell is very good. It has an orange note upfront with a bit of funk and oak underneath it.

The taste is delicious. It has a strong orange note with a light funk and light toffee finish. There is a light oak note to it.

The feel is very good. The beer has a light body to it but a good texture so that it doesn't feel thin. It has a tingling 
sensation. The acidity is really nice. It's very similar to that of orange juice; not taxing for the average person.

Overall, a fantastic gueuze that's perfect for the hot weather to drink or to have something during the day. It isn't overly taxing on the palate."

905,txaudiophile,Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,4.49,"Bottled in 2018, drank from a Teku glass. A most excellent Geuze. Complex flavors, with a hint of clove and some good sourness (but not too much). Very drinkable and refreshing despite its great body and complexity. I will try to find another bottle and let it age longer."
906,augustgarage,Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,4.5,"Blend No 57 - season 16|17 - wort from 9 different brews, aged in 8 different barrels - bottled November 14th 2017 - enjoyed on December 31, 2022. Poured from a caged-and-corked 750mL bottle into my Drie de Fonteinen tumbler.

Not quite clear amber body with an active champagne fist receding to a small fine cap. Vague, sloppy lacing; no legs. Very good retention.

Subtle yet complex aroma - herbaceous and floral with a delicate funk bringing to mind superior washed rind cheese.

Palate entry brings to mind alfalfa fields, sorrel, and salty sea breezes. Tart but not bracingly so. Low earthy bitterness comes and goes. Goat milk, lanolin, crisp malt, and raw nuts. Finishes dry with earth, minerality, umami, and a hint of funk. 

Medium-light bodied, well carbonated, nearly refreshing, but still soft. 

Hard to find a more authentic example of the style - rich, complex, rustic yet refined. Reasonable value given the time and labor involved. A good candidate for aging indefinitely."
907,Holderness,Double Stack,3.94,"The beer with the closest profile I'm familiar with is Mornin' Delight -- mostly through this very distinctive, semi-artificial maple aroma and flavor. The coffee is a little bolder and darker in this one, and the mouthfeel and appearance are definitely less thick. Overall it's pretty good but, like the majority of Great Notion's offerings, a bit gimmicky

79/100"
908,CarolinaCardinals,Double Stack,4.34,"Picked up a 16 oz single from GB's Bottle Shop in Orlando 1-27-24 i think for $8.99. No canning date; consumed 1-27-24.

Beer poured black with a very nice tan head.

Nose is very nice with a beautiful combination of coffee and maple.

Taste is very well done as a large malt base gives notes of mild roast and a touch of chocolate. The coffee and maple adjuncts are woven in very well. Finishes just a tad sweet but definitely not cloying.

Mouthfeel is medium to large bodied and very smooth.

Overall a delicious brew, glad i was able to give it a try!"
909,TheBricenator,Double Stack,4.36,"Look: Pours like motor oil and black as night with a quick-forming brown head that rises and slowly settles to a silky-looking lid, leaving minimal lacing behind
Aroma: Roasted tree nuts, roasted barley, bakers cocoa, maple syrup, cold-brewed coffee, caramel, light earthy notes, piloncillo, and warm brown bread. No alcohol heat detectable
Taste: Whoa. Opens up with a rush of roast, roasted barley, and cocoa that sucker punches the palate before mellowing some and developing depth. Waves of coffee, maple syrup, and tree nuts crash in to join, each shining for a moment on their own before blending into the mix nicely. Earthiness and piloncillo peek in from time to time throughout and closes with chocolate, coffee, brown bread, and maple syrup, along with just a kiss of ethanol
Mouthfeel: Full, silky smooth, medium carbonation, and smooth and full on the finish with a touch of dryness
Overall: This is some tasty stuff. I’ve wanted to try this for a couple years now but hadn’t fully committed to buying it until now as it looked to be odd and unique but maybe not good enough to warrant a full serving which, as I now can say, it is. This reminds me a lot of a bourbon barrel aged Imperial Stout except with the bourbon swapped out for maple syrup and coffee and it isn’t too one-sided nor overly sweet enough for me to only want a few sips. Super fun to try and drink, plus a sneakily hidden 11% ABV. Definitely worth trying to those who think they would be into it as it made a believer in the hype out of me"
910,teromous,Double Stack,3.67,"From the bottom of the can: ""SEEING DOUBLE 09/28/23""

Appearance: It is a black bodied beer with a very short light tan head that quickly fades into nothing. There are a few pock-marks across the still black surface of the beer which look like carbonation bubbles popping, and there is a hairline ring of tan carbonation, but mostly the surface is devoid of a head and the glass is absent of lacing. The label on the can states that this is ""ALC/VOL 11.0%"" so it is reasonable for there to be no head or lacing.

Aroma: Even when just pouring the beer from the can into the glass the room was filled with the scent of maple syrup. Approaching the glass it smells like a diner where everything in the booth smells like maple syrup. It smells nice but it only smells like maple syrup.

Taste: Maple comes through at first, then there is this pleasant toasted flavor which starts out good then cranks up to something awesome. It starts out tasting a bit toasted like french toast but then notes of char and caramelized sugar start to join in which does a good job of pumping the maple flavor, which then in turn pumps the caramel flavor. The flavors in the beer work well in synergy. The aftertaste has some carbon which is nice and it also has a bit of green apple which isn't quite as fitting with the rest of the beer. A bit of vanilla flavor sticks around the mouth when the beer is long gone.

Mouthfeel: It feels full bodied and there is a bit of a twinge from both the alcohol presence in the beer and a bit of the grain bitterness. It has a bit of slickness on the tongue which works well in its favor. The beer shows its ABV which is advertised at ""ALC/VOL 11.0%"" and as always, unless the presence is overwhelming, the high alcohol content isn't a bother. It lacks the smoothness that competitors have.

Overall: The label on the can states that this is an ""IMPERIAL BREAKFAST STOUT"" and that it is an ""imperial stout with coffee, maple syrup, natural flavor and caramel color."" The beer had a definite maple flavor but it lacked the advertised coffee. It doesn't state what the ""natural flavor"" is and it seems odd that a beer with a black body would need ""caramel color"" unless that was a secondary byproduct of another addition, such as the maple syrup or the natural flavor. As a whole the beer was pretty good. The biggest disappointment for this beer was the lack of coffee flavor which this beer promoted. This beer has plenty of sweetness to shoulder up against a more prominent coffee flavor.

As a whole I would probably still buy it again because it just tastes good. It isn't the easiest drinking beer but it's nice. I would recommend a single pour or can to try this before committing to a 4-pack."

Mouthfeel - The body was a bit sticky with light carbonation. The dry finish clung to the roof of the mouth. 

Overall - This was a very accessible, even for those that don’t like sours."

925,sulldaddy,BDCS,4.48,"Sampling a cellar temp 12 oz can poured into my snifter, vintage 2022 but no other date stamp on the label. Received in a trade courtesy of @russpowell. thank you!

the beer pours a rich dark coffee brown color and no light passes through my glass when I hold it to a light source.
A dense creamy head of 1 cm of tan foam rises up from the pour and quickly fades to a sturdy edge layer that sticks around throughout my sampling. There are also a few small islands spinning in the center of the glass. Also get some scattered lacing when I swirl the glass or take a sip.
Aroma is malt forward with milk chocolate, vanilla, brown sugar and a good whiff of bourbon note. No warm or fusol alcohol more of the sweet side of bourbon. Also no hop presence here at all on the nose.
First sip reveals a very smooth textured medium bodied beer with fine soft and gentle carbonation. The carb is very fine and gentle, which all makes for a velvety smooth physical experience.
Flavor is what the nose advertises, with sweet chocolate, brown sugar and some vanilla, all giving way to bourbon notes and a little warming on the swallow. Bourbon flavor lingers and also coats my lips. I do get a little bit of a coffee note in the back of each swallow too. Again, no hops to be found.
Quite a nice imperial milk stout, one that I would gladly drink again."
926,woemad,BDCS,4.36,"12oz can courtesy of Russpowell. 2022 vintage. 10.3% abv, 69 IBUs (whatever they mean, anymore) per UT.

Poured into a snifter, this was an inky black, with no interest in becoming any lighter even when held up to light. Modest, half inch of khaki-mocha colored head. Sparse, spotty lacing.

Bourbon up front in the nose, along with milk chocolate and coffee notes, pretty much in that order.

More complex in the taste than in the nose. Still bourbon-y up front, and with a milk chocolatey sweetness, but there's also a bit of tobacco and dark fruit to the flavor. It all melds together very, very well. 

Body is a little bit lighter than I expected, but not to a deal-breaking extent. Mouth feel is fairly creamy.

This is a very nice BBA stout, one that hit the spot after dinner tonight. Earlier this week I found out for certain that my Mom does not have stomach cancer, as was feared for a time. I decided to drink this beer today to celebrate that fact, and I don't think I mis-chose at all. I would happily drink this beer again as a dessert or nightcap. Thanks, Russ!"

Incredibly smooth and complex flavors; milk chocolate; very subtle sense of whiskey; vanilla; light cinnamon spiciness; light bitterness peeking below the overall sweetness. Heavy body; dense and silky on the palate; very muted boozy warmth.

This is just an awesome barrel aged imperial stout - a double cream stout per the notes. The base beer really shines while the barrel aging amplifies but doesn't overpower the beer. Depth and complexity are rife with this beer. Very, very tasty.

Taste is very similar to the aroma with roasted malt, chocolate, cream, bourbon, dark roast coffee, vanilla, a hint of char, and the taste of dark fruits (cherry) mingling about. Is initially sweet but quickly replaced with the bourbon. 

Mouthfeel is oily smooth with a little carbonation and boozy alcohol warmth.

932,JohnG190,Impermanence,5,"Impermanence has a deep, rich, and opaque black color. It has a creamy, dense, and long-lasting head of tan foam that leaves attractive lacing on the glass. Impermanence is rich and complex, with a strong presence of dark roasted coffee, dark chocolate, and a hint of dark fruit. The coffee notes are bold and robust, chocolate adds a smooth sweetness that balances out the bitterness from the roasted malts. The dark fruit notes are subtle, but add an extra layer of depth and complexity to the aroma. Overall, the aroma of the Impermanence Stout is truly captivating and leaves you eager to take a sip. On the palate, Impermanence has a rich, full-bodied flavor profile that is both complex and satisfying. The initial taste is a strong, bitter espresso-like flavor, which is quickly followed by notes of dark chocolate and roasted malt. This is balanced out by a hint of sweetness from the malt. Impermanence has a creamy and silky mouthfeel that makes it a pleasure to drink. The texture is thick and smooth, coating the palate. The body is medium to full, providing a substantial and satisfying experience with each sip. The carbonation is low, giving the stout a smooth and creamy finish without being too fizzy. Overall, the mouthfeel of this stout is well-balanced and luxurious. Overall, Tree House Brewing Impermanence is an outstanding stout! With its rich flavor, smooth finish, and attractive appearance, it is sure to be a hit with anyone who tries it."

934,brentk56,Impermanence,4.46,"Appearance: Pours near black with a two finger beige head; good retention and leggy with a showering of lace

Smell: Roasted malt, dark chocolate, caramel and coffee with maple syrup supporting

Taste: Roasted malt, dark chocolate and caramel forward with coffee, vanilla and maple syrup adding a variety of dimensions; finishes with lingering roast and maple syrup

Mouthfeel: Medium to full bodied with moderate carbonation

Overall: A very nice milk stout that avoids the cloying sweetness that plagues many of the beers of this style; the way the roasted malt and coffee offsets the sweetness of the caramel and maple syrup is impressive

Thanks, devoured_by_vermin, for the opportunity"

937,Bhubbard34,Barrel-Aged Silhouette,4.21,"2019 bottle, Drank 7/31/23

Pours dark black, zero carbonation. Strong pleasant aroma of chocolate and molasses. Taste is much of the same with an added hint of coffee and bourbon barrel. Feel is thin, and FLAT which really distracts from this being a top BA stout for me. Overall it’s ok taste wise, but maybe 4 years old was way to long to wait on this one"
938,feloniousmonk,Barrel-Aged Silhouette,4.4,"Lift Bridge Silhouette Barrel Aged Imperial Stout. 2014. Bottle Number 239. 750 ml. 1 Pint, 9.4 fluid ounces. Alc. 10% by Volume. Aged in bourbon barrels. Brewed and bottled by Lift Bridge Brewing Company in Stillwater, MN, USA. ""The Cold War is over. Serve at 55-60. Degrees. (I still don't know the key for that one.) I will skip the the gobbledygook until later.

(Note: this is one of those very rare occasions when I don't have a photo of the beer I consumed to go along with the notes. I plugged in the iPod touch that use to take them and found nothing. How is this possible? It's part of my regular routine, I never forget to take the pictures. Could I have accidentally deleted them somehow? That's even less likely. Perhaps I was just so excited to drink the beer that I forgot to take that essential early step in my ritual. So, once I realized there were no photos, I fished the empty bottle out of the recycling, and posed it next to the as yet un-washed glass I drank it from. That's not even the true beer in there, I followed Silhouette with another bottle.


I bought this two weeks ago at the brewery. Wish I had another to save and age and savor in the future, but this is the one, and I'm drinking it now. (I'd actually never even heard of this beer, must have been sleeping or something when it was released last year.)


Solid blackness in this one (the darkest beer I've had from this brewery), with a rich, roast tan head that starts big, slims down and stays awhile.

Aroma leaps out and spills the bourbon all over the place. Additional notes of charcoal, molasses, caramel, toffee, dark fruit, …vanilla. Always vanilla. And I like it.

Taste: Ah, mmm, and yeah, huh. Deepness and richness in abundance. This has got everything it needs and it lasts and lasts. Immensely indulgent. Chocolate and espresso and everything dark and deep and delicious. MMM, I'll say it again. And what else? Licorice. We call it anise sometimes. And all those other things.

It's a thing of hugeness and a richness and wonderfully rewarding to the drinker. this is all relative. I am loving this and this is not a chore at all, it is a delight. If you want to read about a chore, check my review of Stone's Crime and Punishment. Yikes, talk about trial and error!

Hey, let's read the gobbledygook. ""Silhouette is as deep and dark as the Northern woods. It's brewed in the style of an Imperial Stout. Aromas of coffee, chocolate, molasses and prune meld with a unique dark roasted character. . The beer is complex, rich and full bodied. It's wild spirit will warm the senses, illuminate the soul, and grow into a traditional favorite…no matter what season."""
939,MNAle,Barrel-Aged Silhouette,4.45,"2020 bottling, 12 oz bottle.

I walked on by this beer many times in the store because I considered it to be overpriced (yeah, I know... it's a ""99 World-Class"" here, but we're suckers for a BA Imperial stout...).

Anyhow, in a weak moment, I did order one from my favorite curb-side pickup store a while back, and it sat in my 'fridge, and sat, until I finally moved it to the cellar to make room for other beers. 

It's back in the refrigerator for Cellaruary.

So, today is the day. I won't be able to compare it to the beer fresh, though, since this is my first tasting of this beer.

Taken from a ~42° refrigerator and allowed to warm for 30 minutes or so unopened. Drinking started at mid-50°'s (a guess).

Opaque black topped by a ½ inch creamy-appearing dark tan head with short retention. Little visible carbonation and what lacing does appear with a tip of the glass quickly slides back down into the tan ring. The ring eventually disappears completely, leaving a still surface.

Very strong aroma. Bourbon first, then barrel. Molasses. Slight hint of vanilla.

Rich flavor, mirroring the aroma. Bourbon, oak, vanilla, sweet molasses. Adding to the party is roasted malts and dark fruits. Toward the finish and into the aftertaste, dark chocolate appears along with the alcohol, slightly warming my mouth in the after. The finish is sweet vanilla and dark chocolate.

The body is substantial, approaching viscous (but not quite getting there).

Overall, this BA stout is excellent, indeed. A rich aroma and flavor, a substantial body, lots of bourbon and barrel without overpowering the underlying Imperial stout flavors, a sweet, but controlled sweetness, finish. It's not a dessert beer, but an excellent evening sipping beer. If I'm feeling like splurging, I may actually buy it again!"
940,chum_husk,Barrel-Aged Silhouette,4.53,"REview#1600,This thing is all barrel, but that's not a bad thing in this case. If I had to say something bad about it I would say it is sorta harsh and abrasive at times, overpowering and (this sounds dumb) kinda too smooth at other times... unbeer-like if that makes sense, tastes like some sort of new better drink that supersedes beer into a more betterer territory"
941,ovaltine,Barrel-Aged Silhouette,4.35,"Pours black with leakage to mahogany brown on the edges and a tan head. The nose has oaky, boozy barrel notes, some dark chocolate, and stone fruit.

The barrel is forward on the taste, coasting into the dark chocolate and stone fruit notes, which works really well. The mouthfeel is full, but just the slightest bit watery. Overall, thought this is outstanding."

943,LunchMoney,Barrel-Aged Silhouette,4.52,"A slight fizz, but then no head. Nearly black, pours thick.

Feel is outstanding. Creamy and silky smooth. 
An excellent beer!"
944,hmf05,Bomb!,4.38,"Pours jet black. Aroma is coffee, chocolate fudge, salted caramel, and some slight booze. There is a touch of earthiness from the peppers but it's subtle. Taste follows suit.

O - a pretty fantastic stout that's probably overshadowed by abraxas and BA abraxas"
946,SpaceCamp,Bomb!,4.46,"L: Pours a dark hickory, forms no head and a very thin espresso ring around the edge of the snifter. No noticeable lacing or retention, with a distinctive oily character. Has a crunchy, dark chocolate hue when held to the light.

S: Cacao nibs, bourbon barrel, oak, vanilla, and coffee. Hints of chili heat.

T: Strong coffee roast, cacao nibs, vanilla, and roasted malts. Slightly astringent. Faint chili burn in finish.

F: Medium- to full-bodied. Thick, creamy mouthfeel. Moderate carbonation.

O: The sun rises in the east, Prairie delivers another outstanding stout."
947,SaCkErZ9,Bomb!,4.47,"Got a bottle of this from Charleston Beer Exchange years ago. Finally getting a chance to try it and I am stocked. I have had this fresh on draft but that was probably 6 years ago and I was unable to get a review done. 

Pours pitch black with a small, wispy toffee colored head. Sporadic lacing. Aroma is coffee and chocolate and figs and alcohol. Mouthfeel is a little thin for my liking. Slightly watered down but wonderful flavor overall. I enjoyed the draft version more and this bottle was a bit of a letdown. Solid beer but plenty better."
948,journey-of-beer,Bomb!,4.75,"Look: exceptionally dark brown, almost black. Very thin mocha colored head, minor lacing. 

Smell: very well-mixed chocolate and vanilla fight for dominance. Moderately strong coffee and malt. 

Taste: follows the nose. The chocolate, vanilla, coffee, and malt sweetness are all present. Nothing is overpowering. No real taste of chile peppers until the back end (see feel). 

Feel: rich, silky, velvety, and smooth. Low carbonation as expected given the style and the 13% abv. Warmth from the alcohol during and after swallow. Tingling spice on the tongue (from the chile peppers) long after the swallow. 

Overall: one of the best - and possibly THE best - adjunct imperial stout I have ever had the fortune of trying. Exquisitely well-balanced flavors."

Small pop upon opening, thin off white head with short retention. Deep copper/amber color…glowing with limited clarity.

Bright entry, high acid and a palate cleansing mouthfeel. Slight zing and tannin along with fine carbonation that scrubs the palate with each sip."
953,eluvah,Consecration,4.41,An extremely complex beer. Had the pleasure of drinking this at Iron Abby in Horsham PA. A fruity plum on the nose. I can taster the plum as well as some notes you will find in a Cabernet such as tobacco with a sour and dry finish.
954,JohnniEMc,Consecration,4.2,"Served from a tap in a clear pint glass, it's modest biege head didn't last long. The brew is a deep brown-amber, almost mahogany, bright and surprisingly clear for all the color. The only aroma is that almost woody sourness common to good barrel aged ales. The barrel tannins dominate even the Brettanomyces and currants to taste. no minor feat. Yet, the taste is complex enough that they can be specifically detected. There are too many sours that are really some degree of tart. This is also a little tart, but it's unmistakably sour. The woody tannins linger a little too long in the aftertaste. Other than that, there's no complaint here. The high ABV isn't noticed, the taste is full and complex, delivered within a body that's rich for the style."
955,NCSapiens,Consecration,4,Good sour and barrel flavors.
956,hreb,Consecration,3.01,"375mL cork-topped bottle, bottled on 090622 and served in a stemless CBC glass. Brilliant ruby color with great clarity and little head. Inhaling through my nose I get hit with a powerful whallop of sourness. Oh boy. Yes, the flavor is sour too. It's more balanced than I would have given it credit for based on the aroma and the first sip. But it's fizzy and tart without much flavor, to my palate. I don't get fruit, I don't get wine barrel. I don't get chocolate or tobacco or any of the other flavors printed on the label. But I also don't get ethanol, and at 10% ABV, that's really saying something.

I feel compelled to finish this beer but please, take it away from me."

958,smcolw,Triple Citra Daydream,4.24,"Cloudy as expected with a white-hued, darker gold color. Smaller head that settles fairly quickly. Some random streaks and spots are left on the glass as the beer is consumed.

Fresh cut wet, green hop nose initially. Some dried apricot notes for the malt. Slightly sweet with a bit of weediness in the background.

Smooth, almost creamy mouthfeel. This is enhanced with a fine, small-bubbled carbonation. There's a moderate sweetness juiciness that culminates in the swallow. The lactose sugar is evident but subtle. I do not pick up on any of the oats, but I'm sure they contribute to the richness of the beer. This started with a strong bittering finish, but subsequent swallows offer a far more balanced offering. This beer becomes easier to drink with each passing sip, perhaps it's the 10.5% abv...."

965,fuzzywarren,Permanent Funeral,5,Simply put this is the greatest beer I have ever tasted. A showdown between hops and malt and the drinker wins. Achieving perfect balance on a beer this big is quite an achievement. Paralyzingly good. Bravo!!
966,wmeckley44,Permanent Funeral,4.71,"Had originally gotten this and the cans were bad; I contacted 3Floyds and they actually sent out a fresh 4pk to the store I bought it at and the review is based on those cans. 

Pours a beautiful golden shade, perfectly clear with tons of bubbles and a large fluffy head that slowly disappears

Insane aroma of pine, melon, just extreme levels of hops with a massive malt backbone to stand up to it. Quintessential west coast bite and snappiness.

Taste is extremely dry, this is really only for someone who enjoys the tongue-melting high-powered IPA flavors that a lot of modern beers are moving away from. It's less of a dank or juicy flavor but an overwhelming amount of hops. You can definitely taste the 10.5% and it's not shy about reminding you that it's an experience. In spite of all of this, it's insanely refreshing. I hate to say it, but my palate would be very happy using this as a session beer. Unfortunately, my liver wouldn't make it past the second, but the beautiful combination of strong malt to help balance out outrageously aggressive hops means that while it comes off as very heavy, it's horribly easy to drink.

Mouthfeel is perfect. My first 4pk was flat and really grossly boozy, but the beer itself is lightly carbonated. Doesn't coat the mouth or dry you out whatsoever. Additionally, since it's so dry, there's no residual sugar and it's quite refreshing like an IPA should be.

Overall, 3 Floyds had no reason to help me out and replaced my beer after a weird mishap rendered my original 4pk completely disgusting. I have no idea what happened but they got back to me and replaced it within a day.

The actual product is outrageously delicious and lives up to all the hype I had after seeing the can art and that it was a collab with a metal band. You could probably drink 3 of these in an hour, and then have a really bad morning. It's really that good."

So here we are, the highest rated American Porter on BA, the legendary Hill Farmstead Everett! This is awesome to finally get my hands on a long time want of mine, not to mention I get the pleasure of trying this just 3 days after canning. Let’s crack it open and find out what all the hype is about

Pours a very dark brown with 2 fingers of dark tan head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing

Oh yeah, the nose displays such a wonderful balance between roast and sweetness, I love it. I’m picking up on aromas of medium roast coffee, milk chocolate, brown sugar, earthy hops, raisin, dark toast, light toffee, vanilla, and black pepper

It really upholds the aroma in taste, though maybe a tad less sweet. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting drip coffee, dark bread, brown sugar, honey, milk chocolate, raisin, vanilla, light caramel, and earthy hops. The swallow brings notes of milk chocolate, molasses, medium roast coffee, brown sugar, raisin, dark toast, vanilla, toffee, and earthy hops

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a slick yet sharp beer. Finishes bone dry and roasty

This is everything I was hoping it would be. Wonderfully balanced and smooth, yet drinks well under its abv. I’m so glad I ended up getting 8 of these"
973,BBThunderbolt,Everett,3.63,"Thanks to Roy_Hobbs for this one from his strike during NBS BIF #15. 16oz can (dated 5/18/21) Poured into 16oz tulip. Poured the expected dense, nearly solid, black color with about an inch of tan head head that had decent retention and lacing.

The aroma had a solid, but not overpowering, amount of roast at the front of the nose, backed with solid grains, and just a bit of floral hops.

Similar on the tongue, a good blend of grain, roast, and soft, slightly grassy, hops.

The body was also about typical for the style, perhaps a touch fuller than usual, smooth, and had a dry, roasty finish that lingered.

Drinkability was very good, a nice sipper, and an easy quaffer at the same time.

Overall, a very nicely done brew. A must-try if you get the chance."
974,Scotchboy,Congress Street IPA,4.08,"16oz can pours out that beautiful golden-color full of haze that I appreciate so much in some NEIPA's, with a larger cap of white foam. The nose and palate are very fruity, mostly peachy with some notes of pine, tangerine and other generic tropical fruits. For a 7.2% brew, there is definitely some body to this brew, fairly thick while staying smooth. A really good IPA, I can why its their flagship."
975,TreyIsWilson,Congress Street IPA,4.19,"A - Pours a hazy orange with a sturdy white head. Nice amount of clingy lacing.

O - Nice and easy drinking OG NEIPA."
976,The_Kriek_Freak,Congress Street IPA,4.43,"Pours hazy with a very smooth foam. It smells tropical, with notes of papaya, ripe peach and even pineapple. The flavor matches the smell and delivers a nice bitterness toward the end."
977,champ103,Congress Street IPA,3.06,"Canned on 7/19/23

A: Pours with a near opaque cloudiness. A dense white head rises with good retention and lace. Manageable to pour if you go slow.
S: Some sweet fruits, most people are saying pineapple. Sure, I guess I can go with that. I don't know if these kinds of NEIPA's overwhelm me to a point were I just can't pick anything out, cause I don't get near the expressive fruity/hops aromas as others. Its just vaguely there.
T: Yep, sweet and fruity. Like store bought Dole juice to me. I don't get anything in the finish, but some hop burn...or alcohol can't figure it out...
M/O: I guess I can't be too hard, but just muddled to me. Low carbonation, sticky sweet, no finish, some kind of astringency. Either from hop burn or alcohol burn. This is going to be a chore to finish.

Every once in a while, I like to revisit styles I'm not the biggest fan of, especially when a hyped brewery pops up in my area. To see if or how my tastes change. Well, this is a style I have yet to really enjoy. Some will say ""don't review styles you don't like"" but I'm just trying to see what everyone but me seems to like...oh well."
978,Sandis,Truth - Vanilla Bean,4.5,"12 oz bottle poured into a snifter. Despite the name the vanilla seems light but the bourbon, some chocolate and the thickness make this very nice."
979,SpeedwayJim,Truth - Vanilla Bean,4.47,"500ml waxed and capped bottle into a Tree House wine glass. 

Pours viscous, almost gelatinous. Thick and oily. Huge mocha legs. Nose is booze, fresh and pungent vanilla beans, a touch of sweet soy sauce, and plenty of chocolate and molasses. Beer opens vanilla bean and sweet cream. Touches of lactose, chocolate, and dried dark fruit in the middle. Plenty of barrel, molasses, and heat in the finish. Body is full with little to no carbonation. Rich and heavy on the palate and goes down chewy and viscous. Long, soft aftertaste. 

I really like where these tree house barrel aged imperial stout offerings are heading. This is great!"
980,Roguer,Truth - Vanilla Bean,4.59,"Very little head on the pour - although what it lacks in foam, it makes up for in aroma, as decadent notes of vanilla, toffee, and brown sugar leap from the pour itself.

Up close, the impression is much the same, along with rich bourbon, chocolate, molasses, and espresso. It's incredibly rich and slightly intimidating - in the best of ways. The vanilla is present but not overpowering; the emphasis is on the marriage between the bourbon barrels and the base imperial stout.

Thick and chewy on the palate. Alcohol presence is notable, but never quite harsh; it's a big beer, and it's not afraid to let you know (and the nearly two years in barrels certainly doesn't detract from the effervescent booziness). You can sip, sit, savor, and chew this one without ever reaching a point where it becomes too aggressive, yet it never loses at least a slight bite about the gums.

Tasting notes are both surprising and expected. Yes, there's rich chocolate, molasses, vanilla, and bourbon, but there's also a slight sharpness from the oak and perhaps a more sour mash than some other bourbons which may run sweeter. The beer itself is moderately sweet, leaning toward dessert territory, but by no means cloying. Molasses, honeycomb, toffee, caramel, chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, cherry, red grape, brown sugar, espresso."
981,WunderLlama,Truth - Vanilla Bean,4.47,"Brewers notes: Vanilla Bean Truth is an Imperial Stout aged for 22 months in select wheated bourbon barrels and then conditioned upon heaps of grade A, purposefully selected vanilla beans.

It pours a viscous black color in the glass with a mocha-colored head. When poured cold, the flavor profile leads with chocolate wafer cookies, bourbon-vanilla heat, and rich dark chocolate. As it warms, the true complexity emerges. We taste and smell bourbon chocolate chip cookie dough, bourbon vanilla ice cream, tootsie rolls, and smooth chocolate syrup.

The vanilla character does not overwhelm - the intent here is harmony and integration. The vanilla addition serves to soften the bourbon and chocolate character of the base beer making the whole presentation more confectionary and decadent like chocolate vanilla syrup.

This is an immensely enjoyable beer that rewards the senses as it warms in the glass, revealing layer upon layer of complexity that is only possible to achieve with patience, time, and focused brewing attention.

This beer will develop in the bottle for two years or more but is ready to enjoy now. We believe bottle development is best achieved while cold, and away from light.

Removing this from my wants list …..500ml bottle purchased at Tree House Tewksbury, ranked #212 on the BA top 250, #25 on the BA American Imperial Syout list, # 42 in the top beer list of Massachusetts brews, …a list dominated by Tree House, paid $25 for this bottle. White wax coating on a capped bottle is a struggle to open…the wax is as thick as the beer 

Chilled bottle poured into a Tree House snifter. Thick, viscous black motor oil, produces a thin brown ring and occasional brown ring lacings 

Aroma is bourbon barrel . Vanilla comes out when it warms 

Taste is sweet bourbon barrel, vanilla, chocolate brownie, roasted ground coffee, the vanilla notes emerge as the glass warms, licorice 

Mouthfeel is thick, chewy, viscous, hefty, slight carbonation, boozy but without the heat , fleeting bitter snap on the finish 

Good beer, 13.2% abv makes this a sipper"

Black with ruby edges; dark tan head fizzled out quickly; poor cap retention, thin ring, a few spots of lace; thin legs on swirl. Bourbon nose with cinnamon, sweet plums and green chilies right behind; some boozy heat on the retro nasal. Taste follows nose; more sugary plums and sweet bourbon; figs, molasses and brown sugar; very light chocolate/cocoa nibs; bourbon and dark fruit finish. Hot bite on tongue from peppers and booze; full minus body, not at all adjuncty; smooth, silky feel; full mouth warmth from alcohol (13.3%) and hot peppers. Overall, loads of well balanced flavors; base and barrel merge seamlessly; long sweet bourbon and dark fruit linger leaving cinnamon and hot chilies sauce aftertaste. A sipper for sure!"
986,Beersnake,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.5,"Poured at fridge temp. Pours black as night. A minuscule layer of brown head appears and then flees. Tiny bubbles throughout. 

The nose is insane. Big toffee and dark fruit. Raspberries come to mind right away, but after a few minutes that fades a bit. In comes cocoa nibs, cinnamon, coconut, vanilla, and coffee. 

The taste is amazing. Coconut, vanilla, chocolate, and cinnamon are apparent. Maple syrup seems a lot stronger now. However, the cinnamon and coffee are strong. Flavors are intense. 

Mouthfeel is pretty thick and the beer is clearly low in carbonation. Overall, a wonderful and intense beer!"

Pours near black and opaque, oily looking, with a half inch foamy head and some light oily, foamy cling. Aromas of coconut, chocolate, bourbon, oak, vanilla, cocoa. Flavors of coconut, bourbon, vanilla, chocolate, cocoa, malt, light oak. Smooth, a little creamy, a very good full body, appropriately carbonated.

992,mschrei,Space Trace,4.55,"Even though there seems to be fluidity in the top 250, this will be my 75th on the list. Definitely see why it is on the list. Pours dark, minimal head and lacing. Strong scents of bourbon, coconut, and chocolate. This follows to the taste, as it’s very sweet and boozy, but the flavors blend well. Big bodied, just a hint of oiliness, not thick or syrupy, but assertive alcohol burn. Really tasty."

994,Sandis,Space Trace,4.27,2018 version poured from a 16.9 oz bottle into a snifter. I thought this would be sweeter but I think it is quite good with the cacao standing out more than the coconut. Some booze heat to back it up.
995,Christianriveraaa,Space Trace,4.61,"Rating this from coming across 4 coconut beers - Prairie pirate weekend is number one so far. This is batch 003.
L: Poured from a 500ml bottle into a snifter - jet black pour with 1 fingers length of dark malty foam risen to the surface.
S: Big fudgy chocolatey aromas of coconut, cacao, vanilla, hazelnut, even getting some lactose in this. Can sense it's very sweet.
T: Just as the aroma tells! Brownie/milk chocolate, cacao, coconut hits first followed by some vanilla in the middle and a hazelnut ending. I LOVE this one. This is my favorite bottle logic barrel aged to this day!
F: Heavy, oily thick bodied, easy to sip. Hides ABV very so well. 
O: This is hard to compare with prairie pirates weekend but man this takes the top spot. My new all time favorite coconut chocolate stout of all time. The reason is because the milk chocolate was there, cacao was there, coconut was there followed by the complexity and thickness of the beer. Two separate beers but I'd be very curious to see if they aged this in rum barrels. This might change the whole stout game itself if that were to be the case."
996,lucius10,Space Trace,4.61,"2023 Batch! Sweet milk chocolate, creamy coconut, and hint of vanilla bourbon barrel nose on this one!

997,JohnnyHopps,Peche Du Fermier,4.54,"Appearance - The beer was orange-yellow in appearance with visible carbonation and a half-inch white head. 

Smell - Peach radiated from the glass. Dry farmhouse funk reinforced the peach. 

Taste - There was a lot of fresh, tart peaches in the initial taste. Notes of melon and green apple were also present. Farmhouse notes blended well as the dry notes balanced the peaches. The bright peaches lingered well into the aftertaste. 

Mouthfeel - The beer was full bodied, allowing the taste to linger.

1000,BubbleBobble,Mocha Wednesday,4.37,"2021 vintage. Pours a dark brown with lots of flecks of ruby red as the light hits it; pours rather thin with a fizzy cola head that disappears quickly. Bits of carb hitting the surface. No lacing/retention. Nose is roasted coffee beans, molasses, black licorice, loose change, baking chocolate. Very little barrel character, at least initially. Kind of mind-blowing these days to have a chocolate and coffee stout that doesn't lay it on thick with raw adjunct aromas; while the coffee and chocolate are certainly there, they feel like parts of a whole that developed together, rather than some gunk that's thrown in and overpowers the product. Taste follows a similar vein - big coffee roasted coffee bean notes throughout the palate. Through its very long finish, dark chocolate and dark fruit, vanilla, smoky wood, salty black licorice, and finally, traces of warming, spicy bourbon emerge. As on the smell, a really impressive use of the adjuncts here - not at all overpowering, but still present throughout. Mouthfeel is the only real knock for me. The feel is surprisingly thin, and I think a little more body would be nice (and even expected?) given the ABV. Really worth seeking out."
1001,EMV,Mocha Wednesday,4.45,"2016 vintage. Poured from a brown wax topped bomber into a Tree House tulip. 19.4% ABV

L: Lighter than expected pour. Medium to dark mahogany color with ruby highlights. A thin fizzy off-white head falls fast. Not much in the way of lacing.

S: Rich and boozy. BOOZE. Bourbon and vanilla... some oak, cocoa, and coffee. Mostly booze.

T.F: Sweet and rich. Boozy... as expected at 19.4%. Deliciously complex. Cocoa and coffee mixed with oak, roast, and fudge. The coffee and chocolate especially come through and are nicely complemented by the bourbon and vanilla. A little thinner than expected. Medium bodied... boozy, but not as much as the 19.4% would make you think. Still very drinkable. Low carbonation. Coffee/cocoa finish.

O: An outstanding overdone ABV stout. Great barrel character... and you get a lot of bourbon, chocolate, and coffee on this brew. Held up super well at 6+ years in the cellar. This is an all-night sipper of a beer."
1002,bluejacket74,Mocha Wednesday,4.49,"750 ml bottle, 2021 vintage, bottled 10/21/21, label says 19.1% ABV. Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with not quite an inch tan head that fizzled away kinda quickly but leaves a small bit of head. Small amount of lacing. I like the aroma, the brew smells like bourbon, coffee, vanilla, cacao nibs and roasted malt. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also the addition of some oak and fudge flavors noticeable too. Good amount of barrel character in both the taste and aroma. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's slick, rich and a bit creamy with a moderate amount of carbonation. I thought this was a pretty good brew, definitely worth picking up if you're into big barrel aged coffee stouts!"

1005,MutuelsMark,No Rules,4.53,"Yellow bowling ball I think means 2019. Tried in January 2023. Very boozy nose. Head was tan.

1006,BigIronH,No Rules,4.25,"2021 on draft. 

Pours a pitch black. Swirling gives way to thick oily alcohol legs, almost like what you would get swirling a dram of bourbon. Not much head, as expected for 15% but a pencil lead thin ring the color of hot chocolate sticks around for the entirety.

Nose is earthy sugarcane, burnt brown sugar, molasses, toffee, some cinnamon, and vanilla 

Taste follows suit with the addition of barrel notes, however subtle. This doesn’t drink like 15%. Very easy drinking, oily, smooth, and full. Excellent example of the style and an over expression of what can be done with it. Glad to have finally tried it. Cheers."

1015,Victory_Sabre1973,CitraQuench'l,4.03,"Juicy looking pour. The color seems a bit lighter golden. It really looks like a glass of pineapple juice, but with a very frothy and fluffy 2 finger white head. The beer has great head retention, and there's a good amount of lacing on the glass. 
To be honest, I'm not getting much on the nose. It's a fairly faint citrus hop aroma. 
Taste - There's a citrus flavor to this beer due to the hops, and I think it's tangerine that I'm getting from the hops. The flavor from the hops really keeps building in my throat, and on my taste buds. The flavor lingers in my throat, and I just keep tasting it. 
The body is juicy and also has a crisp feeling. The hops linger in my throat, but they don't feel sticky, or like resin. 
This is a delicious example of the style. The aroma was a bit of a let down, it is a bit over a month old, so maybe that plays a factor into it. That being said, the flavor is there."
1016,Radome,CitraQuench'l,4.3,"Had on tap at the Bass Lake Draft House in Holly Springs, NC.

1017,Treyliff,Reaction State,4.7,"375ml bottle poured into a snifter
2019 Vintage

A- pours jet black in color with a one-finger dark brown foamy head that reduces to a thin ring around the edge

S- bold and rich herbal and earthy espresso notes initially, followed by dark chocolate, brownie batter and a blast of cinnamon. Undertones of the maple pop through, adding aromas of caramel and dark fruit. Light oak and creamy vanilla close out the nose, with more espresso and cinnamon sticking around, very inviting 

T- bold espresso and dark chocolate brownie batter up front make for a perfect opening. Mid-palate brings out plenty of barrel, adding spicy cinnamon, oak & barrel juice. The sweet maple starts to pop out under the cinnamon whiskey, along with a creamy vanilla note to compliment. The finish gives more cinnamon & dark chocolate with a strong espresso and mocha linger 

M- medium body with moderate-low carbonation leads to a foamy mouthfeel that turns slightly creamy into a warming finish

O- every adjunct works in harmony on this one, the bold espresso and chocolate notes, along with the spicy cinnamon and sweet maple, outstanding"
1018,jb_4226,Reaction State,4.9,"#150, yummy!"
1019,Sandis,Reaction State,4.5,"2022 version poured from a 16.9oz bottle into a plastic cup. My day 12 beer for Bottle Logic 12 days of Christmas. Nice thickness. Excellent blend of vanilla, maple and coffee."
1020,maximum12,Reaction State,3.5,"Cinnamon is becoming my kryptonite so I’m hoping it’s been used with an appropriately light touch in this 500ML bottle, ‘cause I like everything else added to this brute. 

Hard black with a few stray brown bubbles that quiet swiftly. Oh Oh. Cinnamon bite is strong on the nose. Please, no, brew deities. 

Reaction State tiptoes along the abyss of cinnamon gorge. Cinnamon is straddling the beer but doesn’t quite crush it into submission. Underneath the spice are touches of maple, vanilla, & the ghost of cocoas past. Light bourbon winds its way betwixt & between & the finish is mulled apple cider. Should have split this one with my wife. 

Hey brewers: quit putting so much fucking cinnamon in your beers. If you can’t get the balance right, throw the crap away. Pretty good beer, which is sad, as I can sense something really good underneath the cinnamon avalanche."
1021,DokiDokiLitFam,Reaction State,4.57,"Pours a dark brown like motor oil. Just a half of a finger of dark brown head shows up and disappears just as quickly. 

Nose is a walloping of bourbon barrel aged stout. Its got that rich, dense, still wet barrel level of intensity. Huge oak profile. I love it. Next is the roasted malt and a strong presence of chocolate. This reminds me a little of one of my favorites of all time; Weyerbacher's Chocolate Pretzel Sunday Morning Stout. Then in the background, there lies the cinnamon. 

Taste is much of the same on the nose. Oak, bourbon, roasted malt, chocolate, cinnamon. But now I get the slight bit of maple syrup. Maple syrup presents almost with, I hesitate to say this, but a sour note when its put in stouts sometimes. Like an extremely subtle tartness or tanginess. It doesn't detract, but it is a unique quality. The tannins from the barrel kind of leave that soapy flavor that also sometimes tends to happen in these barrel aged stouts. Its incredibly mild and doesn't linger, but thats why I decided to put it at a 4.5 rather than 4.75, similar to the nose.

Mouthfeel is fullbodied and smooth. Brief flash of carbonation right at the beginning. ABV makes its presence known, but not as severely as that Maumasi I had the other night. There is a little bit of drying but not harsh on the palate or on the way down. 

Overall my favorite Bottle Logic brew so far. I was surprised because I though this was just going to be another ""breakfast stout"", but this one actually blew me away. Well balanced and all the flavors work well with each other and don't feel like novelty additions. Masterclass level stuff."
1022,REVZEB,Reaction State,4.54,"Opaque midnight black pour with a finger of brown foam. Smells of big coffee and maple forward nose with vanilla, chocolate and molasses accents. Taste is incredible, hype meeting even: coffee, rich dark chocolate, molasses and the difference, lush bourbon, before vanilla, cinnamon, and bigger maple elevate to a finish with espresso biscotti and a lingering caramel nougat. Lush, rich, smooth, full and decently thick with good barrel warmth and coffee percolation."
1023,Rug,Coconut B-Bomb,4.34,"2017 vintage

I know this one is a bit old, and I was honestly surprised to see this older vintage on Tavour, but given how highly regarded this one is I just couldn’t pass it up. I’m sure the coconut is past its prime but it’ll probably still be good. Let’s dig in

Pours a very dark brown with a finger of light tan head that slowly fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing

The nose is quite sweet, but there’s a surprising amount of coconut left and still rather balanced. I’m picking up on aromas of sweet bourbon, molasses, brown sugar, raisin, raw coconut, chocolate fudge, vanilla bean, burnt caramel, and light tobacco

It doesn’t hold up quite as well in taste, but I can’t really say I have any complaints. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting chocolate fudge, sweet bourbon, toasted oak, molasses, vanilla, burnt caramel, brown sugar, black cherry, and light coconut. The swallow brings notes of cocoa powder, vanilla bean, toasted coconut, molasses, brown sugar, raisin, burnt caramel, and earthy bourbon

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a smooth beer. Finishes mostly dry with a very slight boozy heat

This held up better than I expected actually. Not that I’ve ever had a fresh one but still"
1024,mschrei,Coconut B-Bomb,4.6,"2017 vintage. Still plenty of coconut flavor. Pours with a brown head and mild lacing. Scents of bourbon, coconut, cocoa, and caramel, all of which carry over to the taste. Hints of dark fruit on the under current. Medium bodied, easy sipper, subtle booze presence. Quite enjoyable."
1025,Whyteboar,Coconut B-Bomb,4.09,"This is for the 2019 release; sent to me by @colts9016 as part of NBW BIF #15
Poured nearly black, which for a winter ale was a bit surprising. Still, capped with the brown head it looked quite enticing.
The aroma was bourbon, and that’s about it.
The taste followed- there was some roasted malts that came through but I couldn’t find any coconut in the mix. Not sure if if it “aged out” or something, but I never found it.
The feel was excellent for the flavors, bourbon is a sipping drink you know.
I am glad to have tried this, but would like to revisit a fresher version if possible."
1026,Phyl21ca,Coconut B-Bomb,4.35,Bottle: Poured a deep brown color ale with a large brown foamy head. Aroma of strong coconut notes with some sweet caramelized malt and chocolate notes is quite enticing. Taste is a mix of strong coconut notes with sweet caramelized malt notes and some chocolate notes. Body is full with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol notes. Very enjoyable if you like coconut.

1029,Cathartes,KBS - Maple Mackinac Fudge,3.83,"12 oz bottle acclimated to 50°F and poured into a stout glass.

Pours impenetrable black, with a 0.5 finger, long lasting, sudsy, British khaki head, leaving light splotches of lacing.

Initial aroma is seriously thick, and very heavy on booze, it smells a lot like a sweet alcohol. I pick up some maple, but I'm not sure I would have had I not known what it was. It's very sweet and sticky smelling, and there's maybe a hint of vanilla, though that could be the booziness.

After agitating it remains the same, though slightly more alcohol.

Initial taste before swallowing is powerful, it's got some bitterness to it but it's got sweetness behind it. There's a smoky char to it that I really enjoy.

After swallowing I first get bitter cocoa powder. A strong char develops and lasts a good while, lasting into the finish where it mellows quite a bit and takes on a slightly metallic quality. All the whole sweetness lurks behind any foreground taste. I can really taste the alcohol after a few tastes and it's not incredible, not exactly bad but I don't quite love it, and I am a fan of high alcohol beer."
1030,57md,KBS - Maple Mackinac Fudge,4.08,"Pours a dark brown color with ruby edges and a half finger of tan head. The nose is all fudge upfront with maple syrup notes on the back end. The only bummer is that the barrel notes are pretty weak. The flavor follows the nose but everything seems muted compared to the potent smell of this offering.

This is a fine variant but it is not exceptional."
1031,guitarguyny,KBS - Maple Mackinac Fudge,4.02,"Smells like maple syrup, chocolate and coffee! Tastes like chocolate and some coffee. Maybe very faint syrup taste. Aug 22 bottling date. I think the 3rd stout I’ve had to date. Maybe not my thing?"
1032,chinchill,KBS - Maple Mackinac Fudge,4.32,"12 oz bottle with a 26 October 2020 bottling date stamped on the back label. 

Near black body with a thin, semi-durable beige head. A thin dark reddish-brown edge is visible with back lighting. This smells quite sweet, I assume from the bourbon and maple syrup. It has a lightly sweet taste with a laudably balanced mix of chocolate, bourbon, and coffee. Not surprisingly, maple syrup notes are faint. Relatively thick and very smooth body. Well hidden ABV. 
Overall. The dessert version of KBS."
1033,Whyteboar,KBS - Maple Mackinac Fudge,4.47,"Poured stout black and was topped by a dense brown head of 1” in height with lots of lacing down the snifter.
The aroma was strong, so strong even my Covid affected nose caught a wiff of the chocolate and bourbon.
The taste was very well balanced for so much chocolate, and rich chocolate at that. It was the star of the show but the supporting cast of coffee and dark fruits and bourbon were not lost but very present.
The feel is darned near ideal for the genre, just a tiny bit less “chewy” or viscous than expected.
Good beer, if they brew it again I would drink it fresh instead of cellaring it for 3 years. But even then it is very good."
1034,Roy_Hobbs,Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),4.41,"Bottled on January 10th, 2020. 

This is a nice looking beer both on the pour from the bottle and in the glass. The color is like pretty much every other stout, but that's not a bad thing. There's a thin, short-lived head along with really, really nice legs. 

Aroma is wonderful in its simplicity with notes of bourbon barrel and malty sweetness. Very enticing. 

The taste closely follows the nose. Roasted malts, just enough sweetness, and some nice charred oak. Once again, the beauty is in the simplicity. This is isn't loaded with adjuncts, it's just a very well made imperial stout. I'm particularly enjoying the full body and the nice roasted notes on the long finish. 

Overall, excellent."

1036,Holderness,Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),4.24,"2020 vintage. A very solid and canonical example of the style, perhaps *the* prototype of what a bourbon barrel aged RIS should emulate. I find the style to be a little bit on the roasty, herbaceous side and this was no exception. The barrel aging did smooth things out quite a bit in the flavors, although I was surprised that the mouthfeel wasn't fuller. Overall very glad to finally try this but I definitely prefer Beyond Good and Evil, and their other sweeter BBA stouts

Consumed 10/28/2022

I just got a job offer today, so I needed to pull something out of my cellar to celebrate. I traded a bottle of EH Taylor small batch for this bottle of beer, so let's see if it lives up the hype and $50 I paid for the bourbon. It does look spot on amazing. It's super thick but not syrupy in a bad way. This is the kind of stout that beginners would hate and neck bearded beer nerds crave. On the tongue it's super full and soft. Absolutely perfect for the style for me. I'm not getting enough on the nose though to wow me. I get bourbon and chocolate. I smell the typical lovely bitterness of a RIS. Still, it's lacking in the nose for me. Drinking it though everything lives up to the hype. It's less sweet than a typical Goose BCS which set the standard for me back in the day. I can taste the booziness but in a good way. I like high abv stouts where I can taste the alcohol a bit. Why make a bourbon barrel aged stout if the bourbon isn't front and center? What's different and great is that there's also the balance of the base beer. There's a lot of plain old RIS here. Take your best like a Darkness or Expedition and add the bourbon with everything balancing out perfectly. The finish is long and toasty like a good cup of coffee. A great beer and worth the bourbon (at retail.)"
1038,Pearlyp,Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),4.87,Hands down the best beer I’ve ever had!
1039,Siriusfisherman,Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),4.6,"Pours a deep, black with a thin mocha-colored head that dissipates quickly. The aroma gives notes of charred oak, bourbon, dark fruits, dark roast coffee, and vanilla. The flavor is less sharp, and more rich with notes of dark chocolate, espresso, chocolate chip cookie, and oaky bourbon and vanilla. The flavor lingers well after the sip with rich, chocolatey cookie flavors. The body is very full and creamy without ever being syrupy, leading to a very balanced finish. Overall, a very flavorful and drinkable beer. One of my favorite BBA Stouts I have ever had, very well balanced flavor and mouthfeel. Highly recommended."
1040,Travitten,Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),4.7,"Uh, nearly perfect"
1041,2beerdogs,Old Stock Cellar Reserve (Aged In Brandy Barrels),4.29,"Thanks to CarolinaCardinals for sending this to me in our Barleywine/Stout BIF #1.
Pours a burgundy tinged copper in hue. Sandy head leans forward with about a finger of fine foam that slowly dissipates to a thin cap. Very lithe, layered lacing.
Nose begins with a melange of the usual suspects. Toffee, dates, and caramelized sugars. But chiming in right away are: some deep barrely brandy notes, some dried apricot, tawny port, and a most mild toasted almond.
Flavor is still a balancing act between what one would expect from a barleywine and the brandy barrel. This is a sipper that calls to you to sit down, relax, focus in a meditative way. The interplay between everything the nose hinted at is like a tennis match played in molasses. At times, the subtlety of the toasted almond note gives way to the deep fruit. Moments later, the fruit goes from deep and almost tannic to bright and sweet, then comes around to a wet barrely must. Leather notes give way to chewy date. 
The mouthfeel is medium, low carbonation, and gently warm, a hint of vanilla comes in on the finish.
Overall, a sublime sit and sip is offered up for you to escape this modern world."
1042,StonedTrippin,Old Stock Cellar Reserve (Aged In Brandy Barrels),4.43,"2020 vintage, such a delicious brew, i have been wanting to try this brandy edition for years so, was pumped to finally get the chance! deep and patient leggy mahogany in the glass with a short tan head and a lot of viscosity. the nose on this is insane, dark leather, rich stewed fruit, dried apricot, winter spices, wet oak, and a lot of alcohol, kind of hits like cognac to me, wintery and warming, dates and figs, a little musty and oxidized, which i always think flatters this sort of thing, layers on layers here, caramel and vanilla richness too, wow, and it sure is strong! the flavor is right there with the nose, dark cigar, old leather, strong woodiness, maple sugar, toffee, chestnut, raisin, peach nectar, and just a ton of the brandy, insane complexity and unrivaled cohesiveness, very well aged too, this is mature without being decomposed at all, and this is up there with the best barrel treatments on this thing, the brandy is so forward, essential in here, i cant imagine this without it now. vanilla bean and wafer cookie, sweet malt and tree bark, festive spiciness and alcohol heat. i love everything about this. full bodied, light on the bubbles, and slow moving with a glorious aftertaste. this could warm the coldest soul, and i cant say enough about it. an absolute gem, top strong ale of any kind that ive had in some time..."

1046,TheBigBoy,Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything,3.42,"Good - but have better from Other Half. Can't zll be great guess. Still good flavor and very drinkable , absolutely nothingbwrong with this guy."
1047,DaveMaciolek21,Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything,4.93,"Amazing the complexity Other Half can pull off with a single hop! Cloudy yellow pour with a solid foam cap that laces the glass beautifully. This Imp IPA feels light despite the ABV, a classic indicator of an oat base. Orange, pineapple and tropical fruit flavors dance on your palate for days. This is in fact a world class beer. Go get some!"
1048,Ushouldbeworkinh,Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything,4.37,"Deep yellow colour, nice rich haze. Smells of orange, quite ripe and little tropical aspect to it, label leads me to lychee. Taste id the same, but more detailed and with more depth, very nice taste. A little to thin in feel for my expectations. Overall very nice, though not quite as good as I expected considering the hype."
1049,ovaltine,Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything,4.5,"Pours a very hazy pineapple color with a creamy white head that coats the glass. Gorgeous hazy. Big, dank citrus notes on the nose, including ripe oranges, pineapple, mango,, and passion fruit make for a mouth watering nose.

The oranges and mango are most prominent on the taste and delicious, complemented by the pineapple and passion fruit flavors and a smidge of sweet oats. Really tasty stuff here. 

The mouthfeel is full and soft, perfect for this beer. Other Half rocks."
1050,Smakawhat,Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything,4.47,"Poured from the can into a Spiegelau IPA glass. Canned Sept 12th 2023.

Pillow cream top head, bright but also really ice cream like white with a soft top. Real nice classic three finger height on a controlled pour, with a body color that is flat opaque, and with at least a bit of shiny custard yellow color.

Aroma is a hop delicious bonanza. Juiced up pineapple and orange, moving towards cantaloup and melon flavors also. Faint touches of grass like herbs that cuts down the sweety fruit aromas nicely. Lots to explore here, and the malts and yeast stay out of the picture.

Palate in every way is just rich. First sip is creamed orange, hinting even of vanilla like sweetness, and even a milky thick texture. Blasting but soft controlled herbal grass finish, which leads to excellent sweet mint and sage like aftertastes. Honey. Cream. Tangerine and pineapple fruit bowl flavors, in a silky juiced creamy malted feel.

Quite a solid amped up and dialed in IPA, with a surprising hop flavored diversity. Exceptionally done here."
1051,eppCOS,Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything,4.49,"L - Murk bomb, but with quality fine lacing and head. No issues for the style.
S - WOah - Orange blossom flowers, and a cut-through lawn with a bit of dank weed (yeah, some of that ol' cat pee, too)
T - Fantastic full bloom citra profile - citrus, floral, bouquet of almost eating a whole pile of roses, gardenias, with orange zest piled all over it. 
F - Balanced, so smooth it destroys you before you know it. In a good way. In a CITRA way. 
O - I have zero issues for this beer; I have zero notes. I just can't bring myself to bring it a perfect score as I'd like just a tad (a TAD) more bitterness - my issue with imperials versus DIPAs."
1052,stevoj,Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything,4.49,"16iz can from Tavour. Hazy yellow pour, one finger fluffy white head. Ripe, fruity aroma, orange, pineapple. Taste is juicy, grapefruit, orange, pineapple, creamy, zesty. So full, so tasty."
1053,drdiesel9483,Jammy,4.67,"Look - reddish auburn slightly haze with a nice big slightly pinkish white head and sticky
Smell - tart funky blackberry jam with a nice woodiness.
Feel - medium full body with a fizzy medium carb tang
Overall - outstanding"
1054,JohnnyHopps,Jammy,4.33,"Appearance - The beer poured a reddish purple color with a bubbly white head. 

Smell - The is a jam presence in the nose. It was sweet, but tart. 

Taste - Underripe blackberries led the way before green apples. This beer was quite sour. It drank more like a sour than a farmhouse. 

Mouthfeel - The feel became quite dry in the aftertaste. The carbonation was somewhat weak. 

Mouthfeel - I wanted more farmhouse funk."
1055,dpgrifs,Hold On To Sunshine,4.13,"The only knock, for me, is the peanut flavor. I love peanut’s with my beer, just not brewed in it."
1056,Blogjackets,Hold On To Sunshine,4.48,"Poured from a pint can, a coffee black body with a mocha brown head. Light lacing throughout the tasting. 

Aroma is a delightful sweet coffee and chocolate with a wee hint of peanut. 

Taste follows nose and adds a slightly fuller peanut flavor that pairs well with the milk chocolate and coffee flavors. The latter is more assertive in taste: bold, roasty flavor. The lactose flavor is present but it stays in the background and is subservient and complimentary to the other flavors. 

Mouthfeel is creamy with solid carbonation."
1057,drdiesel9483,Hold On To Sunshine,4.46,"Look - Black with just a fantastic thick tan head and great rimming and lacing
Smell - Roasted Coffee, Chocolate, Caramel, and slight Peanut Butter
Taste - Chocolate and Peanut Butter stand out first, followed by the roasted coffee, caramel, and vanilla. Really blends well without being overlly sweet
Feel - Full, thick and creamy. Lighter carb with a slight crispness to it
Overall - Really fantastic. I'm not usually a fan of PB stouts but this one just kills it!"
1058,RT-Kris,Hold On To Sunshine,4.42,Super tasty very dark desert beer. Very thick and a bit overpowering so one will do it.
1059,johnnnniee,Hold On To Sunshine,4,"Can from Jeff, thanks for the hookup!
Inky black with a huge frothy creamy light tan head that slowly recedes. Rich milk chocolate and creamed coffee with bits of licorice and dark fruits. Pretty nice!"
1060,JJKBeerLvr,Hold On To Sunshine,4.56,"Poured from 16oz can into pint glass in February 2023, that I purchased at their brewery in Charlton, MA. There is a date of Winter 2023 on the bottom of the can, and I drank this about 1 month after I purchased it. 

Appearance: Very dark black with 1-finger head. The head was dark brown, and disappeared after a minute. It left only a little lacing on the glass, and no head remained after a minute.

Smell: Strong mix of aromas filled the room as soon as the can was opened. Roasted coffee, caramel, and chocolate aromas. Not much hop style citrus or pine aromas.

Taste: There is taste of coffee, chocolate, and licorice. Also, some vanilla, peanut butter, and roasted malt flavors. They are more balanced than I expected from the aroma. Flavors are very bold. There is a strong alcohol presence that matches 7.6% advertised. A sweet chocolate, and vanilla aftertaste with edge of coffee, that is really enjoyable.

Mouth-feel: Very thick, but with an extremely smooth and creamy body.

This is a very good Porter, and one of the best Porters I have ever drank. It has a variety of flavors that adds a nice complexity to the beer. The balance of flavors is outstanding. The flavors of coffee and roasted malt nicely balance the bitter coffee with the sweet chocolate and caramel flavors. This is even better than the Tree House Cartharsis Porter, which is very good. This is very smooth and enjoyable to drink. I have enjoyed all the beers I've bought at Tree House, and I would buy this again."
1061,thebeers,Hold On To Sunshine,4.08,"Dark brown with a half finger of audibly fizzy dark khaki head that quickly settles into a lasting crown. No real lacing.

Roast peanuts, peanut butter, roasted malt and quality breakfast blend coffee in the aroma.

The taste spotlights peanut butter, very light chocolate and caramel and some roastiness from the complementary coffee. 

Creamy, full bodied feel with a mouth-coating oiliness and light zip to the carbonation.

Peanut beers aren’t my thing, but this is a very nicely made one."
1062,Jaycase,Barrel-Aged Malevolence Chocolate Caliente,4.41,"22 oz bomber (2015)

A- Pours pitch black with a thin mocha colored head. Minimal lacing throughout. 

S- Dark chocolate comes through immediately with undertones of vanilla. There is a light undercurrent of cinnamon wafting in the background. I take an extra strength whiff (for science) and only then can I start picking up some stale, oxidation characteristics. It is nearly imperceptible and has no real impact. 

T- Following closely from the nose, the flavor starts off with smooth dark chocolate dominating at first, with the vanilla providing ample support. As the beer warms to room temperature, the cinnamon starts its move from the periphery to becoming a more integral component. Cinnamon is something which can easily be off putting to me in larger doses but here it is well integrated and nicely complements the stronger chocolate and vanilla flavors. No perceptible heat or spiciness to me from the chile peppers. It's quite possible this aspect has faded over time. I do think there are some remnants adding to the total flavor profile but I'm just not able to easily pick them out. The only slight knock I can give is that the barrel characteristics are minimal. 

M - Slightly oily with a medium body. Carbonation (medium) has held up quite well. 

O - For whatever reason, I had low expectations going in for this beer after being cellared for six years. However, it has held up remarkably well in that time. I regrettably did not have this beer when it was released so cannot give any comparison. On its own, it's a delicious beer."
1063,MacMalt,Barrel-Aged Malevolence Chocolate Caliente,4.64,"I received a can from @FBarber in a BIF. Canned on 1/29/2020. Poured into a snulip glass. I took it out of the fridge about 2 hours before pouring, then put it back in about 15 minutes before pouring. It pours a very dark walnut - approaching black. The medium mocha head dissipated very quickly, a sign of the alcohol content. Lots of raisin on the nose, along with roasted malt, chocolate, a whiff of freshly-brewed coffee, and earthy charred nuts. You can also readily smell the bourbon barrel. This is right in my wheelhouse taste-wise. It opens with bakers chocolate and coffee but the raisin has carried over, as well. There are also notes of caramel and earthy char, and the caliente pepper adds heat. The bourbon barrel is strong but not distractingly so. As the glass warms, I think the chocolate is stronger and a bit sweeter and the pepper hotter. The feel is viscous and creamy with lite carbonation and there's no avoiding the 14% ABV. The 12 oz. format is appropriate. Overall, this is a superb example of RIS - my favorite style, and it richly deserves its World-Class rating. I really like the combination of the chocolate malts and dark fruit."

1065,JLK7299,Popinski - Bourbon Barrel-Aged - Peanut Butter And Marshmallow,5,"First of all, the smell. I could sit all day with the glass to my nose and just smell this all day. Thick mouthfeel. Very very tasty. Just a great dessert stout!"
1066,Sandis,Popinski - Bourbon Barrel-Aged - Peanut Butter And Marshmallow,4.56,"2022 version poured from a 750ml bottle into a snifter. Nice thickness. Dominant peanut aroma. Solid blend of chocolate, peanut and marshmallow flavor."
1067,BGDrock,Darkness,4.46,"Body is about as pitch black as it gets, the pour build a thick, dense, marshmallow head, the colour of milk chocolate.
Dark roast malt aromas of bitter coffee bean and chocolate, along with some cassis, licorice, charred marshmallow.
Was expecting an aggressive flavour, but this is surprisingly subdued, tasting most like a silky chocolate gelato; the feel stands out as a soft caress, with a barely there carbonation that somehow manages to work, likely in part due to the full, creamy body; it has some residual sweetness as you'd expect, but it's within reason and makes for a rich dessert; the taste is single-minded, decadent, slightly fruity, milk chocolate, just slightly bitter in the finish.

The reality is not nearly as frightening as the packaging - this is a luxurious, focused stout, nicely balanced, with a subtle feel."
1068,ZebulonXZogg,Darkness,4.46,"Thick, oily black pour, huge foamy head that hangs around and leaves a nicely laced glass. Boogar machine says heavily roasted malts, some dark fruit. Taste buds get all that plus some licorice. Thick oily texture coats the mouth. This is probably the best tasting beer I've had, just awesome."
1069,buschbeer,Darkness,4.07,"1 PINT 9.4 FL. OZ. bottle
Served in a snifter
2020

This beer pours black and is topped with a couple inches of deep mocha head that leaves nice lacing.

I get notes of dark chocolate, cherry, and anise. 

It starts with dark chocolate. Anise quickly enters the flavor and continues through the finish. A little black coffee in the finish. 

Full bodied with a thick, creamy mouthfeel

It's beer awhile since I've had such an acclaimed non barrel aged, non pastry imperial stout. While this beer has kicked my ass due to abv, I can't say it was amazing. It tastes similar to Founders imperial stout but has a thicker mouthfeel."
1070,IsaiahHoogendyk,Darkness,4.86,"I think this is the best Imperial Stout I’ve ever tasted. No barrel-aging, no weird dessert additives, just a straightforward, brownish-black, strong stout ale. Surly does this one right and as near-perfect as I’ve quaffed."
1071,JackRWatkins,Darkness,3.46,"A: robust khaki 4 finger head, strong head retention, nice lacing, dark dark walnut brown in color, almost opaque. 
S: subtle notes of chocolate, some hints of grain, subtle hints of coffee as well and a slight tartness, with some additional notes of toasted malt that are reminiscent of a brew day. 
T: a bit of sweetness up front that is slightly milky or sugary, notes of coffee, hints of tartness that suggest cherry but never quite get there, some roasty notes, pleasant savory bitterness in the finish that marries with a milky or vanilla like sweetness. Alcohol is very well masked.
M: on the lighter side of full. A little under-carbonated. 
O: This is a competently executed imperial stout that is simultaneously typical and a bit peculiar. Everything you would expect to be there is there, and other than some small surprises on the nose, there’s not really anything unexpected. What is unexpected however is how equal all the flavors seem to be. Nothing takes pride of place or dominates and the whole affair seems a bit understated. It feels like it is pulling its ingredient list from the American Tradition and its sensibility from a much older tradition, one that favors something more balanced than aggressive, think more ‘Courage’ and less ‘Stone’ in its temperament if that makes sense. It’s a very good beer, there is nothing that it attempts to do that it outright fails at, but the sum of the parts here is for me, a little underwhelming."
1072,jkblr,Darkness,4.33,"16oz can in a cardboard box = fancy. Canned 09/19/23 (about 2-1/2 months ago) poured into a Spiegelau stout glass at just above fridge temp 12% ABV per can. The beer pours pitch black with no light penetration and medium brown colored head. The head recedes to a rocky cap and leaves spotty lacing all over the glass. The aroma is moderate with notes of bakers chocolate, coffee beans and red berries. The taste is bittersweet roasted malt with expresso, caramel, berries and dark chocolate followed by slightly ashy, earthy moderate plus bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium plus bodied with just less that average carbonation and a mostly dry finish. Overall, world class RIS."

1077,JohnnyHopps,Leche Borracho,4.64,"Appearance - The beer poured a deep black color with tan specks at the top that bring to mind spice. 

Smell - The spice and delicious tequila were apparent in the nose. 

Taste - At the front, I was made to think of spicy cinnamon chocolate cookies. Notes of raisins, ancho chili, and tequila follow. There was even a hint of lime. After a few sips, heat built up in the throat in the aftertaste. 

Mouthfeel - The body was smooth and thick, perhaps just above medium bodied. Carbonation was noted. 

Overall - I love tequila aged stouts."
1078,mvanaskie13,Crusher,4.24,"Poured into a wide mouth grip shaped goblet: color is straw gold, hazy/murky, head is brighter white and presents one finger thick, some spots on the glass sides. 

Smell is dank, sweet candied notes, light onion/grass, toasted malt, citrus, some pine, earth. 

Taste is similar with candied hops, dank, citrus, pine, grass, earth, malt and light toast. 

Mouthfeel is lower carbonation, moderate sweetness, moderate bitterness. 

Overall a very good hazy, more bitter DIPA - great hop aroma/flavor depth and solid bitterness to back the sweetness."
1079,Smakawhat,Crusher,4.55,"Poured from the can into a Spiegelau IPA glass. Canned June 21st 2023.

Hazed and opaque body with a muted orange but fairly dark and still. A mix of custard but has a much darker than expected color. The beer nearly appears frozen. Head is quite soapy, fine white bubbles of three fingers with light retention. Shampoo like top but lots of ring lacing to match.

Aroma is a hop surprise. Hints of soft dank, but a real gumdrop like candy sweetness that matches nicely. Thick and rich, with a light sense of sweet malt to counter as well. The contrast between dank and sweet hop aroma on this is exceptional. Huge juicy dank sweet punch is the only way I can describe it, like hop thick Kool-Aid.

Palate brings things a little more into focus, but does not hold back. Mid palate hits with a hot but delicious earthy mid palate punch. Large and bold, but controlled hop blasts of pine, earth, juiced candy orange pineapple and mango rolling into a minty finish that just does not quit. It doesn't stop there, with a creamed earthy mouthfeel that feels like a sundae, and smells like sweet tilled garden earth.

A bit of a punishing sensation, but in a real good way, Crushing indeed."

1082,superpete93,Crusher,4.53,Nice beer. More bitter than Heady or Focal but not overwhelming. To me this tastes more like a west coast DIPA. Not sure if the ABV is off on these but a little goes a long way--these can really sneak up on you.

S-Pine forward dank layered upon a malt base of simple light syrup and caramel

I've been meaning to get my hands on this one. A double IPA from one of my favorite Ipa-making breweries. And this doesn't disappoint, with massive pine and floral notes. Smells (and tastes?) like a bottle of pine-sol

great stuff"
1087,beerthulhu,Sosus,3.9,"A: Medium haziness of orange for coloring with a white soapy foam composition of one inch. Sticky strands of lacing. Strong carbonation factor.

S: Really sweet sugary peaches, watermelon and guava. A bit of strawberry-lemonade. Good strength. Has a bit of juicy Gatorade flair. 

T: Dry flowery hopping, citrus, and orange grind with a bready malting. 

M: Bready malty consistency for mouthful. 

O: Overall loved the nose, fruity and berry like, fresh, wet and Gatorade like. The flavor was a bit less impressing, less complexed and basic."
1088,TreyIsWilson,Starry Noche,4.45,"A - Pours a syrupy thick deep dark brown with a ton of coconut floaties. No real head to speak of. Heavy amount of sludgy lacing.

S - Aroma is dark chocolate, oak and huge barrel notes.

T - The taste is dark chocolate, coconut, hazelnut and tons of barrel.

M - Full body with medium carbonation. Syrupy thick mouthfeel with a slick drying finish.

O - Top notch."
1089,Sandis,Starry Noche,4.75,"2022 version poured from a 16.9oz bottle into a snifter. This beer is wonderfully thick. Probably the best ""toasted"" (coconut/hazelnut) flavor I recall having in quite some time."

A: Poured into a snifter to a black beer which is topped by a small light tan head which fades quickly to a collar around the edge of the glass with minimal lacing
S: Smells of brandy barrels with some chocolate, coffee, and roasted malts
T: Taste is chocolate and coffee up front with some brandy barrel influence. Hints of roasted malts and toasted marshmallows. On the swallow there's more brandy barrel, chocolate, coffee, and roasted malts
M: This beer has a body which is lighter than anticipated and slightly silky. Carbonation is quite low, but it is there while the beer has a sightly drying finish due to the ABV
O: Overall this beer is quite good. It has also held up well over time. Complexity also grows as the beer warms. It's definitely worth a try if you like barrel aged beers."

1093,Harrison8,Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,4.26,"Pours black with a finger of khaki foam. Head retention is good after an aggressive pour. Aroma is big. Apple brandy, toffee, barrel, char, and caramel dance and play over roasty and toasty malts. Flavor profile is medium-thin. Roasty and toasty malts lead the charge. Toffee, caramel, molasses, and apple brandy tag on for a flavorful brew. Mouth feel is velvety, and soft, but never hits creamy. It has a medium-thick consistency. Overall, solid stout with hints of apple brandy coming through.

Reviewed from notes. Reviewed 1/12/19. 2018 version."
1094,Fordcoyote15,Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,4.5,"Really enjoying this. Much less sweet than anticipated and has a nice chally bakers chocolage predominace. The apple brandy tastes genuine and natural whereas I feel I lot of prairies beers are try hard and artificial. Namely vanilla noir which is awfully fake.

Its not terribly complex. Taste like a very simple, basic, strong old school RIS with roasty notes layered with oak and yesz apple bransy. Quite thick and very hot."
1095,BlanBarry,Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,4.79,This rating is based on the original from a few years ago. Pours dark brown/black with exceptional thickness. The Apple Brandy melds perfectly to make this an exceptional barrel aged stout. For a number of years this was my favorite beer.
1096,5toutman75,Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,4.58,"I have never really been a fan of the apple brandy BA stouts. The apple character has always been an odd mix for me. I got this bottle for retail on the shelf mostly because I love Prairie and I knew people flip for this beer. Upon opening it, the smell is very distinct and I just don't like it! It smells the way it's supposed to smell, it's just that the apple brandy barrel of off putting to me. Now on the tongue, it's a completely different story for me. The apple is there but distinct and really appealing. A tiny bit tart? The stout's sweetness works well with this barrel. It also helps for it to be a bit warmer too. A great beer that changed my mind. I've never had a beer with a smell that I didn't like end up being enjoyable before, so a really fun beer."
1097,JohnnyHopps,Barrel Aged Bomb!,4.21,"Appearance - The beer was deep black in appearance with tan bubbles crowning the pour. 

Smell - Chocolate and cinnamon were the most prominent notes. It did not seem to have a lot of heat.

Taste - Like the nose, the profile was chocolate forward with cans of cinnamon. The booze was not terribly heavy. There was just a touch of spice that lingered at the finish.

Mouthfeel - I anticipated a bigger body with this beer. Did the barrel aging cause the body to deteriorate?

Overall - I had a little bit of disappointment with this one. It did not burn like regular bomb."

The taste follows with a very sour profile, white stone fruits from the chardonnay, the oak is present but compliments well the whole thing. Quite balanced.
It gets better as it warms UP

1108,beergoot,Blanc De Blancs,3.98,"Very clear, light gold body; lively carbonation; no head. Nice farmhouse smells; barnyard funk, fresh cut hay, some lemon and other citrus notes. Very pleasant flavors; sweet white wine; green apple, lemon, raspberry, and peach; tart. Moderately heavy body; smooth and rather flat; very acidic overall with a touch of underlying sweetness for depth.

I heard good things about this beer and paid a pretty price for it ($65, actually ordered it by mistake, but so it goes). Overall, this is a decent beer for the style but not something I think warrants the price paid for it.

A huge shoutout to merpunk1 for hooking me up with this one in a trade! It’s the highest rated Bière de Champagne (and #245 overall), so it’s only fitting to drink this baby on New Years Eve. The rest of the day/night will consist of old classics, but it’s nice to open something fancy for my last review of 2021. Let’s get into it

Pours a cloudy orange gold with a finger of white head that quickly fades to a thin ring and leaves minimal lacing. Eventually fades to absolutely nothing but it's still a decent looking beer

Man, I'm really digging the nose on this one, funky and delicate at the same time. I'm picking up on aromas of white grape, white wine vinegar, tangerine, sharp oak, and earthy apple

It's straight up explosive in taste, in your face and complex while being downright drinkable. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting tart green apple, sour white grape, wet hay, sharp oak, lemon zest, and crackery malt. The swallow brings notes of earthy white white, old leather, tart white grape, apple skin, sharp oak, floral honey, and lemon zest 

A light medium body pairs with fine carbonation, resulting in a tart and crisp beer. Finishes mostly dry with just a touch of residual sweetness

This is great stuff, and a great kickoff to NYE. It's been a hell of a 2021, both on here and in my life and general. So, cheers BA, happy new year!"

Taste: Sour, tart, vinous, white wine grapes, honey, oak, funk, with notes of sharp acidity but not overly so.

Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with moderate to soft carbonation.

Overall: Solid beer with nice aromas and flavours with abv completely hidden."
1111,MacMalt,Blanc De Blancs,4.49,"I received a bottle from @fbarber in the NBS BIF #14. Poured into a Side Project Lambic glass also courtesy of @fbarber. It pours a cloudy, bright orange. It looks like Orangina. The head fizzled away almost immediately but that is typical for the style. The nose is just superb: like a fine Chardonnay; I'm smelling lemon, orange peel, and peach. It's taste is sublime; funky, oaky white wine grape with soft notes of peach that sweeten the Brettanomyces and native Missouri microflora. It's so delicate and fine. It has the expected effervescence and it doesn't drink like 10% ABV. Overall, Blanc De Blancs is an absolute delight. I'm privileged to have had the chance to try it."

1117,MonDak_Joe1953,Aurelian Lure,4.45,"16.9oz bottle. For dating, label includes the details of 'BLEND SEVEN AUGUST 2022'.
Cloudy, apricot orange colored body. No real lasting head. No lacing.
Aroma of apricot, oak, and rich funk of expresses horse blanket, leather, and hay.
Taste is initially quite woody and herb bud like, and then the sweet/sour apricot comes in. Notes of lemon wash through, along with the dry oak. Late is white wine. The funk is very much of grass and hay. After taste does not last very long, but the essence of apricot lingers.
Tart and drying mouth feel. The teeth are scraped clean with each sip. Quiet carbonation.
The apricot expresses so naturally here, and is the longest lasting flavor note. The herb, oak, funk, and lemon are worthy subordinates."
1118,brentk56,Aurelian Lure,4.22,"Appearance: Pours a slightly hazy light amber color with a bubbly collar that fades away; no lacing

Smell: Bracingly sour; funky with an apricot tone

Taste: A hint of apricot passes across the tongue and is followed by a strong funky character; the apricot tone lingers underneath though, after the swallow, a bracing sourness emerges; oaky, dry and a lot of pucker in the finish

Mouthfeel: Light to medium body; no carbonation

Overall: Not for the uninitiated, Aurelian Lure harkens back to some of the tongue buckling sours that largely seem to have gone out of fashion these days"
1119,BEERchitect,Aurelian Lure,4.26,"Brewed with apricots, spontaneously fermented and allowed to ripen to full sour ale maturity, you'd think that this time honored way of beer making is rooted in the belly of Brussels. But nope, it's Austin Texas.

Aurelian Lure is the lambic-like brainchild of Jester King, pouring with a pale and deep lemon yellow with a light golden center. As the yeasty ale rises with a dainty champagne froth, the jaw-tightening scent of citrus, vinous and stone fruit carry the piquant tang of cider, dusty funk and extended oak aged white wine. As a scantly sweet taste briefly visit the tongue, early impressions of wafers, honey and sourdough offer a slim malt impact.

A quick wash of acidity across the middle palate shows a quick erase of anything malty and an ushering in of sour apricot that stand proud above the other fruity complements of weathered lemon, grapefruit, lime and yuzu. Dried pineapple, peach and white grape all continue to grow from the natural fermentae of the sour ale and play into a strikingly sour late palate of off-vinegar, mature and peppery acids that pang away on the sides of the tongue.

Light, crisp, succinct and highly refreshing, the session is sweat inducing and tooth achingly sour to satisfy the taste for unblended lambic in the deep south. As an afterglow of weathered woods, wine rot and an overall mossy type of earthiness come in brief waves, the aftertaste is otherwise short and concisely winey."
1120,REVZEB,Aurelian Lure,3.94,"Murky darker yellow body with a white cap. Smell blasts you with sour apricot backed by complex oak, orange and farmhouse yeast. Taste is a cover up of the scandal. The scandal you ask? The apricot is wickedly acidic and pretty sour too, this is then covered up by farmhouse yeast, light barrel funk, lemon, and oak, but for that moment when the scandal was alone on the palate it was rough. Very bright and sour, funk is not impactful here, oak is brightly so, acidity builds as the secret wants to get out. I love JK but this is the #15 wild ale in the world? Nah, I wouldn't have this again"
1121,JohnG190,Aurelian Lure,4.46,"Pours a hazy golden color with a thin head that dissipates immediately. The aroma is immediately noticeable, with a strong scent of apricots and a subtle hint of oak. Upon tasting, the apricot flavor dominates, with a tartness that is balanced by a slight sweetness. The oak barrel aging adds a layer of complexity, imparting a mild vanilla flavor that complements the fruitiness of the apricots. The beer finishes with a refreshing tartness that lingers on the tongue, leaving a dry finish.
One of the standout features of Aurelian Lure is its balance. Despite being a sour ale, the tartness is not overwhelming, and is instead complemented by the sweetness of the apricots and the subtle oak notes. This makes for a beer that is both complex and approachable, with a flavor profile that is likely to appeal to both seasoned sour beer enthusiasts and those new to the style.
Another noteworthy aspect of Aurelian Lure is its mouthfeel. The beer is medium-bodied with a light carbonation, which adds to the refreshing quality of the beer. The combination of tartness and effervescence make this a perfect summer beer, though it's enjoyable year-round.
Overall, Jester King Brewery's Aurelian Lure is a fantastic sour ale that showcases the brewery's expertise in wild yeast and spontaneous fermentation. It's a beer that is both complex and approachable, with a balanced flavor profile and a refreshing mouthfeel. While it may be difficult to find due to its limited availability, it's certainly worth seeking out for any beer enthusiast looking to try something truly special."

1126,Roy_Hobbs,Juicy,4.47,"Bottled on February 14, 2020. Pours a vibrant golden color with a finger of medium density white head that receded to a thin ring. Aroma is excellent. A combination of wine barrels, orange, lemon and miscellaneous tropical fruits burst from the glass. Maybe a little bit of tart funk, but it definitely takes a back seat. 

On the tongue, the funk is much more present. The taste leads with wine barrel / oak funk. Mid palate I get some tropical notes, along with wildflowers. I don't believe any dandelions are in this beer, but to me it tastes like they are. On the very long finish, the funk has more of an earthy feel. Surprisingly full body. Well carbonated and smooth, despite a bit of acidity. 

Overall, this is an excellent beer. Complex and layered in a way I don't often see. The barrels really add to the experience. An excellent example of what happens when skill and patience combine."
1127,DoctorZombies,Pliny For President,4.73,"Pale gold pour; excellent clarity; tight white head wit good cap retention; solid ring; some spots of lace. Pungent dank weedy skunky nose. Medium light body; moderate minus carbonation; no astringency. Overall the strong long lasting nose was a bit too much, but delicious nonetheless."
1128,JohnniEMc,Pliny For President,4.37,"A full clear pint glass, drawn from a tap begins the quest. There's almost no head, but that's the standard Philly pour. Its color is very bright and lightly copper-amber. There's a fresh, but not pungent aroma of floral hops and malt. Despite sparse glass lacing, it's delightfully carbonated. To taste, it's a great hop and malt balance. That works for the tongue, but runs the mouthfeel a little too thinly, especially for an IPA. The 7% ABV is nicely incorporated into the overall taste. The finish is clean, but a little light in flavor for an IPA. Fifteenth best American IPA, how? It's so much better than the oat and wheat infused common American IPAs, but that's a low bar. This is a very good beer, perhaps almost flawless in what it provides. But, a world class beer makes the drinker say, ""wow!"". This doesn't."
1129,NeilSilber1,Pliny For President,4.59,"Pours yellow gold with nice frothy white head. Full blast DIPA, clean and beautiful! Notes of sparkling sage and spice laced grapefruit IPA with bursting hops."
1130,MutuelsMark,Pliny For President,4.46,"Light yellow in color, straw like. Head was full and white. After first sip, head gave way to awesome lacing. Nose piney and grapefruit maybe. First drink was smooth, fruity and piney with a nice bitterness on the backend. Very soft on the palate. 

Wow, just WOW!!! Almost makes me wish presidential elections happened every year!"
1131,VashonGuy,Pliny For President,4.36,"Pliny for President (PfP) pours a dirty amber, with not much head, but really lovely lacing. The smell is fruit, lots of melon. It's not nearly the citrus bomb of Pliny. The taste is melon, a little citrus, and a bitter finish. As with the smell, it's fruitier than PtE. The feel is thicker and more syrupy than PtE. Overall, it's a nice variant on Pliny, a recognizable relative, but distinctly different. Hunt for this. You won't regret."
1132,redresonatedragon,Pliny For President,4.68,"Super dank, herbal, grassy, a little cat pee, onion, citrus, dry finish with perfect carbonation. This was super fresh, so I’m stoked to have stumbled across this one. One of the best IPAs I’ve had in California"
1133,LiquidAmber,Pliny For President,4.39,"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a light to medium golden amber with a two finger white head with great retention and solid lacing. Aroma of pale malt, citrus and lightly piney hops, orange, grapefruit, lemon, pine and light green melon. Flavor is pale malt, citrus, piney and dank hops, catty dankness, grapefruit, lemon and light mixed tropical fruit. Medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess. My first opportunity to try this Pliny variant, even though I was eligible to vote when it first came out. Typical hoppy burst when opened, although somewhat subdued from regular Pliny. The initial part of the taste is very much much like the standard version, but lots of complex herbal hop flavors develop into a hoppy, pleasantly bitter finish. Lots of flavors to parse for a second each. I still remember my first Pliny and the amazing burst of hops on opening followed by more hop herbals than I'd experienced before. This one is not quite as bitter and somewhat less of the intense citrus and pine, but the hop bill is fine and interesting. I for one will be voting for hopcare for all this coming year as recommended on the bottle."
1134,thebeers,Pliny For President,4.02,"Hazed yellow with an off-white head that leaves great lacing. Pine, honey and dough in the nose. Similar tasting with some white pepper added. Mild tea-like bitterness. Medium bodied with a light zip to the carbonation."
1135,beergoot,Pliny For President,4.39,"Pours a clear, pale yellow color; fine carbonation bubbles, small, dense and lively; fairly thick head, white and semi-creamy with thin, lasting rings of foam encircling the glass. Outstanding aroma of melon with floral overtones; delicate notes of light malt grains. The flavors are nuanced and balanced; faint biscuit flavor carrying a mild hop bitterness, slightly herbal. Medium body with a soft, velvety density.

This is a triple dry-hopped version of Pliny the Elder, and the brewery kicked some dorsal posterior with this edition. The mouthfeel for an India pale ale (I'm sure PtE is the base beer, so actually a double IPA) is simply phenomenal. Soft and creamy on the palate and making a fine delivery vehicle (if you will) for the base beer and hops. Simply fantastic!

This is one of those awkward beers that floats in and out of the BA top 250 but I picked up for the tick anyways. Bottle Logic Stouts have been impressing me recently as well so I figured this one was worth a shot. Let’s pop it open and find out if it’s any good

Pours completely pitch black with 2 fingers of dreamy dark tan head that fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing

The molasses is very forward in the nose, odd since I was expecting the rye to dominate but I can’t complain. I’m picking up on aromas of blackstrap molasses, chocolate fudge, sweet whiskey, vanilla bean, rye bread, earthy cinnamon, light raisin, and a touch of tonka bean

It’s more balanced in taste but the molasses is still super loud. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting toasted oak, sweet whiskey, rye spice, molasses, brown sugar, cocoa powder, vanilla bean, and light rasin. The swallow brings notes of blackstrap molasses, brown sugar, rye bread, maple syrup, vanilla bean, cocoa powder, tobacco, sweet whiskey, and raisin

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a slick beer. Finishes mostly dry and drinks significantly below its abv

This is yet another great one from Bottle Logic. I’m not sure if it’s top 250 material, but still damn good"

Mostly the same flavors: bourbon, rye, chocolate, malt, vanilla, some molasses. Has a fairly spicy taste and a light sweet note. Smooth, a little creamy, a solid full body, appropriately carbonated. 

Strong barrels and lots of rye is a pretty good recipe. It’s a little sweeter than expected, but this is pretty delicious.

1145,papposilenus,Foggy Window,4.34,"From a 16oz can, dated 08/29/23. Served in a spiegelau IPA glass. Cap-tip to @franktank18 for his resourcefulness, incidental generosity, and just how murderous he looks in a tie.

Pours an opaque milky orange with two fingers of airy, whipped egg white-like foam. Retention is fairly decent, leaving a fizzy cap and sudsy, slippery lacing.

Nose is pretty faint but, what there is of it, seems to me sugary, candy-like. Aroma of lemon drops and orange LifeSavers.

Taste is less sweet than expected, drier and more tart. Tasting lemon rind, tangerine and gooseberries. Some astringency standing in for actual legitimate bitterness - but not such that I’d care to complain about it.

Feel is dry and drying, clean and maybe feeling a bit lighter bodied than it really is due to fairly aggressive bright and fizzy carbonation. There’s a mildly acidic and boozy smoulder in the gullet, not unexpected given the abv.

Overall, tasty and gone all too soon. In accordance with can instructions I shall now refrain from operating machinery for some appropriate period of time."
1146,JohnnyHopps,Foggy Window,4.48,"Appearance - The beer was the expected hazy orange color with a fluffy white head topping in the glass.

Taste - from the moment of the first sip, the profile was very orange forward. However, it was not all candy fruit, as there was a nice level of bitterness. There were notes of fluffy dreamsicle orange throughout the taste.

Mouthfeel - This was a thick one, with the haze clogging the spaces in between teeth.

375ml bottle served in a little snulip. Vintage 2022. Got it from @ozzylizard in NBS BIF #17.

Pours black with no head, looks still. Smell is bourbon and vanilla, burnt toffee and near-burnt nuts, sweet molasses, hint of something like cinnamon or nutmeg.

Taste is (for me) dominated by cinnamon. Nuts are still there, and something comes across as milk chocolate. Molasses sweetness. I was feeling a little bit of spice on my lips and thinking it was a bit odd for cinnamon to have that much power but not be totally overwhelming for me, and then I read on the label that it contains habaneros, and that's clearly evident now that I saw it. As it's warming up, the cinnamon is becoming even more powerful.

Mouthfeel is nicely thick and chewy. Overall...it appears to be a pretty good stout with a nice level of pepper, but too much cinnamon for me."

Printed on the label “2022”. Stored at 34 degrees at home. Served at 54.6 degrees F in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. The final temperature was 59.0 degrees F. 
Appearance – 3.75.
First pour – Ruby Brown (SRM 24), almost opaque.
Body – Deep Brown (SRM 30), opaque. Under direct light, same. When rear lite, shows a translucent olive at the top edge and ruby at the bottom.
Head – None. While pouring, a five mm crescent of large bubbles appears on about a third of the circumference but quickly evaporates.
Lacing – None.
Aroma – 4.25 – Bourbon and barrel are the predominant aromas, no malt, no yeast, no hops, no chocolate. Oddly, no habaneros. No ethanol (13.7 % ABV as marked on the label) aroma. 
Flavor – 4.5 – The habaneros set up a nice oral burn, not too hot and lacking any vegetal flavor. Cinnamon rides in on the aftertaste. Initially no hops, malt, or yeast; light chocolate and ghostly vanilla. Slight gastric warming, but that could be from capsaicin as well as ethanol. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl.
Palate – 4 – Medium; creamy; soft carbonation.
Final impression and summation: 4.25 Lacking both head and lacing, the appearance loses a few points. Both the flavor and aroma are quite good, with distinct hits of habaneros, cinnamon, cocoa, and even detectable vanilla, all supported by the bourbon and barrel. Very good and well worth grabbing if you run across a bottle or six. Extra points for having a lizard on the label."
1152,Blogjackets,Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,4.4,"Poured from a 12.7 ounce bottle, the body is a dark cola brown. Small initial head that quickly dissipated and no lacing of consequence.

Aroma is a complex mix of bourbon, cinnamon, vanilla, and chile. The habanero aroma is muted but present.

Taste follows nose though the barrel is a tad sweeter than the nose. You'll need to be patient to pick up the notes of walnut and oak rising from the stout upon which this beer was made (Oil of Aphrodite). The habanero is felt in the swallow, but it's a light heat. In fairness, I love habs and you might perceive more heat. The cinnamon and cacao nibs balance the pepper and the barrel holds everything together in an unlikely tasty stout. A bit more malty char would be welcome, but that's a personal preference and not a complaint.

Mouthfeel is good but not great. I'd love a bit more body in this stout. More carbonation would be welcome.

Overall an outstanding stout that I interestingly found a bit better when colder than I usually drink stouts. The mix seemed more flavorful when first poured."

Smell: Moderate barnyard funk, grassy/hay notes, and mild fruity notes.

Taste: Following the hints from the nose, I pick up moderate funk notes, moderate grassy/hay notes, and mild citrus fruit notes. The individual flavors are very distinct from each other but at the same time form a cohesive flavor profile. The beer finishes dry with some mildly bitter grassy/hay notes.

Mouth-feel: Light-bodied with a modest level of carbonation.

Overall: A very nice Saison. Tasty flavor profile with a light body and dry finish."
1156,REVZEB,Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,4.31,"Cloudy golden body with a white cap that settles into a collar. Grapefruit, lemon, bright oak, faint melon and passion fruit, faint yeast nose. Taste is simpler with big lemon and oak, mild saison yeast, faint ripe tropical fruits. Feel is light and cool, sour and slightly acidic, dries a bit with yeast on finish"
1157,Phyl21ca,Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,4.23,Bottle: Poured a blonde color ale with a large white foamy head with good retention and light lacing. Aroma of tart notes with some funky Brett notes and light vinous notes. Taste is a mix of tart notes with some funky Brett notes and a vinous finish with light oak. Body is about average for style with good carbonation and no perceptible alcohol. Enjoyable saison with a nice level of complexity.
1158,o29,Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,4.51,"Pours soft hazy yellow/straw with a massive head and great retention. Nose is primarily brett, lemon, oak, but smells fantastic. Taste is similar to the nose a light tartness from the lemon and hay, funk from the brett, and balance from the oak. The flavors all blend together wonderfully to form a fantastic saison. The mouthfeel is soft and pillowy. Each taste of the slight tartness invites additional sipping. Just a wonderful farmhouse ale."
1159,augustgarage,Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,4.32,"Poured from a 750mL bottle into my Troubadour tulip:

Lightly hazy icterine liquid supports a half finger of magnolia soft peaks. Crenelated, nearly rocky lacing; superior retention. 

Lemon curd, wildflowers, hay, and short bread in the nose - mild wild notes and hints of white grapes as well. 

Brett. forward on the palate, tart, funky, and gently peppery. Unripe pears, meyer lemon, and some minerality. Low bitterness, moderate sourness. More fruit than phenols. Finishes fairly dry with some residual ""wild"" elements. Flavor improves a bit as it warms with some faint peach emerging.

Medium bodied, soft, well carbonated. Refreshing yet satisfying.

Well crafted; controlled rather than rustic. Better with food, as the ale's flavors seem more refined and diverse in contrast to whatever bread/cheese you might pair them with."

F- quite thin for what this beer brings with it. Has a silky feel, just needs more body. There is no carbonation.

O- this was a beer I always wanted. Would not put out the $ for the bombers. Found these 4 packs in 2021 and overall am disappointed. Not a bad beer but with Zero barrel and a light body I’m out after I finish the one more I have sitting."

I personally enjoy more sweet stouts where this is very very bitter and woody. However, I believe the complexity and richness speaks to the craft and would be absolutely loved by some. 
F - Feel is slightly bubbly and thick.
O - As stated, I want to like it but it's not quite sweet enough for my tastes, and it's extreme earthiness is beyond my pallet. That said it's enjoyable and worth a try."

There are notes of burnt marshmallow in there, as well as a taste of either ripe plums or fresh Mediterranean figs. With an ABV of over 11%, this beer does not come off as overly boozy, despite its aging in bourbon and French oak barrels. Finally, there is a finish of sarsaparilla and milky molasses. 

This beer will only get better with age. I see this beer as mellowing its edges with another year or two (if you can wait that long), on the shelf, aging."

1173,Antg8989,The Abyss,4.06,"Unsure of the 99 rating. Wasn't impressed a year ago, and not impressed a year after proper aging. Dark chocolate and leather are present but there is a ""burnt"" characteristic to this that just turns me off. Some astringency as well. Interested to see 1 more year of aging on this to see what happens, otherwise there are plenty of other barrel aged stouts out there I find to be much more preferable."
1174,NevadaBill,The Abyss,4.34,"Drinking a 2018 bottle (cellared). This RIS has a roasted malt or grain characteristic which sets it apart from some of the others. It is not a sweet beer with lots of cherries, plums, or fruits. Rather, it is a dry, dark and burnt character leaning towards tart/bitter end of the scale for me. It is like a dry RIS. I like it. More of the bitter Chocolate and Coffee end of the spectrum. It is mellow, and not boozy (for me). Mouth feel is medium, and not too chewy. Just right actually. Looks like motor oil from an old V8 that has not been drained in 20k miles. Reaching for my 2nd one just now. This is a quality product from Deschutes."
1175,swierczt,The Abyss,4.28,"2017 Reserve. Bottled on 10/13/17. Pulled this bottle out my cellar. Was not sure what to expect, but...it is still tasting great! I suspect that the wax over the bottle cap along with the hefty ABV helped. Pours jet black with a frothy coffee colored head. Some slight hints of this beers age come through in the nose, but not enough to be offensive. As many other reviews state, there is a lot going on in this offering. Every sip offers up a new flavor or aroma that I did not pick out in the previous. The barrel aged flavor complements this beer instead of overpowering it. The nose is the only hint that this beer has just over 5 years on it. Overall, an enjoyable and complex imperial stout."

Pours an opaque pitch black with a bout four fingers of tight brown head. Incredible retention, great lacing.

Strong smells of nuts, coffee and baker's chocolate.

Taste follows. Strong black coffee and bitter dark chocolate up front with milk chocolate and nuts in the background.

Full-bodied mouthfeel. Bitter aftertaste. Not as smooth drinking as I was expecting. Nice small sips to extend the enjoyment. Probably all the coffee. Aftertaste is a mixture of bitter coffee and dark chocolate.

Obviously Tree House is known for their NEIPAs but don't sleep on their milk stouts! Great beer."

Semi-sweet and well balanced with some nice roasted notes. Overall, pretty good beer. I'm impressed with how well this has held up."
1180,Damian,All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,4.23,"Drank from a 1 pint can purchased at Tree House Brewing Company, Charlton, MA
2022
Served in a Tree House Brewing Company tulip

The beer poured a syrupy and rather intense looking pitch black hue. An inch-tall, tight and creamy, mocha colored crown topped the liquid and slowly fell to a thick, lasting collar. Streaks and drops of lacing stuck all along the sides of the glass.

The aroma was decent initially and definitely improved with time. Moderately roasty with day-old coffee notes. Bit of acrid character and perhaps some raw cocoa too. As the beer sat, sweet, creamy lactose notes appeared. Good dose of vanilla as well. Chocolate syrup was also noticeable. The sweetness and the chocolate character intensified as the beer sat.

The flavor profile was also solid but perhaps not as smooth as the nose. Malty and robust up front. Roasted malts were most apparent. Moderate caramel malt presence too. Cold coffee was also noticeable. Subtle lactose and vanilla notes were detectable in the center. Slightly sweet. More roastiness on the back end and the finish. Moderate amount of bitterness. Some alcohol warmth came through as well.

Nice creamy, smooth mouthfeel. Medium bodied for the style. Slightly syrupy. The liquid contained a finer beaded, somewhat prickly effervescent that turned fluffy on the palate.

All That Is And All That Ever Will Be is an enjoyable beer, though not as impressive as its ratings might suggest. Both the flavor profile and the mouthfeel came across as a bit flat. I feel like many of Tree House’s imperial milk stouts definitely suffered in quality when they moved from bottles into cans."
1181,dcotom,Abraxas,5,"Taken from fridge and allowed to warm before pouring into a stemmed wine goblet. Pitch black, with a thin tan head. Untappd lists this at 80 IBU, but I'm not getting it. What I am getting are huge aromas and flavors of cocoa, cinnamon, and vanilla, plus char, licorice, chili heat, and enough alcohol warmth to ""...light up the city of Toledo"" ($1 to Trapper John McIntyre). It's also quite sweet, with a syrupy mouthfeel and a long and satisfying finish. Nothing to complain about here. This pushes all the right buttons for me."
1182,hmf05,Abraxas,4.73,"Pours jet black with a huge creamy tan head. The aroma is incredible. I get cinnamon up front with some of the chilis. I get a touch of chocolate but no vanilla. Holy crap is this balanced. The taste is cinnamon, chilis and chocolate. No bitterness, but not cloyingly sweet either. Alcohol is not noticeable. Hard to say I've had a better imperial stout. 10/10"
1183,MutuelsMark,Abraxas,4.53,"Horse, super dark with a nice tan head. The nose is slightly cinnamon, and even more slightly char. The taste is soft with a bite of cinnamon. The ABV is not super evident as one would expect. Obviously a world-class beer."

F - full bodied with light carbonation - smooth, silky 
O - truly incredible stout. A Xocoveza on steroids."
1185,Snowcrash000,Abraxas,3.94,"Pours an opaque, pitch-black coloration with a small, fizzy head. Smells of roasted, caramel malt and strong milk chocolate and cinnamon aromas, with hints of vanilla coming through as well. Taste follows the nose, with a poor balance of roasted, caramel malt and strong chocolate and cinnamon notes, with the cinnamon standing out particularly, as well as some vanilla and just the merest hint of chilis. Finishes bittersweet, with a medium sweetness, light bitterness and some cinnamon and chocolate lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a medium/rich body and carbonation.

BA Abraxas has got to be the most overrated stout that I have ever tasted and, perhaps unsurprisingly, the same goes for the base version which suffers from exactly the same poor balance that I already disliked for the barrel-aged version. It's basically a total cinnamon bomb, the cinnamon being WAY too overdone here and pretty much drowning out everything else except the chocolate, which only underlines the sweetness of the cinnamon. There's hints of vanilla as well, but next to no chili heat coming through, which this would have desperately needed to balance out that sweetness. At least the roasted malts and a light bitterness in the finish prevent this from becoming quite too cloyingly sweet, but I have had plenty of much better Mexican Imperial Stouts and the hype that surrounds this beer absolutely mystifies me. I will say that the body and mouthfeel are indeed very nice here, rich and velvety, while the chilis seem to come out just a little bit more as this warms. Also, the ABV is very well-hidden, this drinking surprisingly smooth and mellow. This is by no means a bad beer, just feels more like a Pastry Stout than a Mexican Stout to me."
1186,BeerIsGood1337,Abraxas,4.53,"2022 vintage. Cacao and a hint of chili on the nose. Taking a first sip, the cacao really pops. A light chili and cinnamon aftertaste follows. The chili isn't spicy, but it's flavorful.

This is a fantastic imperial stout. At first, I thought this might be a little too sweet, but as I drink more, it's really not. The sweetness does a great job of balancing out the bitterness of the baker's chocolate as well as the cinnamon and I can see why they did it. I might have dialed it back just a hair, but that's a nitpick.

FULL bodied. Nice and thick, like an imperial stout should be. Almost chewy. As the beer gets warmer, the cinnamon gets more noticeable.

Long after a sip, vanilla takes center stage as it lingers on the tongue with the cacao, chili and cinnamon still noticeable in the background. Wonderful.

Overall, this is one of the very best imperial stouts I've had. Excellent job. I will buy a few more of these and see how they age, assuming I can keep them around for a few years without drinking them first."
1187,puck1225,Abraxas,4.54,"Truly an excellent beer!

Bought a bomber of this beer at the brewery this past March. I decided to have it for Father’s Day!

Poured into a tulip glass. Rich, oily dark brown color with a brown head and excellent curtain lacing. Needed to let it warm for the nose to open a bit. Smell of dark chocolate, cinnamon, vanilla and chili pepper. Follows to the taste. Initially the flavors of fresh stone fruit contributed. This transitioned to stronger chocolate, cinnamon, vanilla. The chili also becomes stronger as it warms. Apricot and cream, seriously. Pleasant booze and malt background. Flavors are so nicely woven together. Luxuriant smooth feel. I would love to try the barrel aged version sometime. A great Father’s Day treat!"

Full body, light carbonation. Thick & oily finish.

Bottled 10/23/17. As expected with a 5 year old high ABV stout, it has little head & minimal lacing. Apart from that, this is a very good Imp Stout."

Stickee Monkee is a Belgian-style ale brewed by Firestone Walker Brewing Co. This beer has received much recognition for its complex flavors and rich, dark appearance. It is a sipper, meant to be savored slowly and appreciated for its full range of flavors.

Appearance: Stickee Monkee has a deep, dark brown color with a hint of red. It has a fluffy, beige head that quickly dissipates. The beer is slightly cloudy with visible sediment, which is characteristic of a traditional Belgian-style ale.

Aroma: The aroma of Stickee Monkee is complex and full of depth. The beer has a strong aroma of dark fruit such as raisins, figs, and plums. It also has notes of caramel, toasted malt, and a hint of spicy, earthy hops.

Taste: The taste of Stickee Monkee is equally as complex as its aroma. It has a rich, malty sweetness with notes of dark fruit, caramel, and toasted malt. The beer also has a slight bitterness that balances out the sweetness and helps to round out the flavors. The finish is slightly spicy with a hint of alcohol warmth.

Mouthfeel: Stickee Monkee has a medium-to-full body with a smooth and creamy mouthfeel. The beer is not too heavy, but it is substantial enough to make you feel satisfied after just one sip. It also has a slight alcohol warmth that adds to the overall experience.

Overall Impression: Stickee Monkee is an outstanding beer that is perfect for those who appreciate complex and flavorful beers. It has a great balance of sweetness, bitterness, and alcohol warmth that makes it a great choice for those who love a strong, dark beer. The aroma and taste of this beer are incredibly rich and full of depth, making it an excellent choice for those who want to savor a beer slowly and appreciate it for its full range of flavors."

The taste is semisweet caramel, bourbon and brown sugar with lingering tobacco, oak and leather on the finish. Minimal bitterness.

Presented flat. No foam at all. Deep brown, borders on black.
Smells great. Dark stone fruits and that famiiar Quad on the nose.
Taste is toes on the line too sweet, but it doesn’t become cloying or teeth-achingly so. I think maybe because it’s 7 years old, some if the nuances intended have been lost. But the dark brown sugar, stewed plums and oak barrel all make appearances throughout the chew.
Feel is very dense, quite viscous, no carbonation.

A bit of smoke on the opening of the bottle. Dark brown pouring with a 2 finger tan head, with a fairly aggressive pour. The retention is decent, and there's some lacing on the glass. 
The aroma is strong with dark fruit - I get a lot of plum and raisin in the nose. 
Taste - Tons of plum and raisin hit up front. There's a hint of caramel and toffee on the back. I also get a creamy flavor mixing in, almost a lactose flavor. This last thing surprised me, probably not getting it right. 
The body is very thick and full. Smooth, and very little alcohol burn. 
I love this beer, and so glad I bought it."
1195,tide,Stickee Monkee,4.22,"The beer is mahogany, dark brown color. The beer fizz with sound while pouring, but leaves a thin layer of foam only, which disappears very quickly. The beer smells dark, smoky, brown sugar, coffee, leather, molasses and whiskey barrel oaky. The wooden, oaky barrel aroma is distinct, it’s clearly a barrel-aged strong ale.

The beer is full bodied, velvety, latte creamy, with a bit of fizz tickling on tongue. The beer is moderate sweet (it’s 2016 bottle? 6 years later it’s still not dry?), with a bold palate, with a bit sour (tart cherry), light bitter and subtle salty at back. The taste is great, renders the beer bold, but the flavor is on the stout side than a quad (which should be drier?) to me. The malty backbone is strong, and there’s dark sugar (Turbinado brown sugar from Mexico) added which is not that fruity but with molasses and toffee candy hints. When I sip, I sense some dark chocolate, roasted chestnut nutty, alcohol burn, salted toffee candy, leather and tobacco earthiness, whiskey filled chocolate bottle, dried fig and raisin aromas. The beer taste bold, very malty and dark sugar characters, but it’s not ester heavy nor fruity. My feeling of this beer is a serious gentleman who will not wink or smile, but just sitting still and sipping cigar. This is a malty beverage, really malty, I think it may need another 5 years of aging to became more mellow. I expect more layers in this beer, but currently it’s just a bit too sweet (malty) to enjoy."

1203,nasty15108,Samuel Adams Utopias,3.99,"Poured from a 2019 Utopia bottle into a Glencarin glass.

L - Poured a murky brown Iced Tea color. No carbonation, head or lacing, as to be expected.

S - Alcohol is pretty powerful and in your face, but there is also big aroma of dark dried fruit, Think fig, raisins, dates. etc... Like a strong English Barleywine or a good German Dopplebock.

T- There is definitely some heat from the high ABV, but there is also that delicious dark dried fruit taste with dare I say a bit of cacao? Reminded me a bit of the Chunky candy bar.

MF - The mouthfeel is rather thin and a little oily. That being said, it coats the mouth well and the high AVB lets it linger for awhile.

Overall Utopia is a definite splurge. If you have a Beer Geek friend or 2 and can afford it, it's definitely worth checking out at least once in your life. Is it wildly overpriced, yes, is it mind blowing, no. That being said, after splitting a bottle with a great friend, I have zero regrets,"

1205,damndirtyape,Samuel Adams Utopias,4.45,"2017 vintage - shared with me from a friend. Small 2oz pour for each of us. Served in a small 4oz snifter tasting glass.

Appearance: Clear dark amber-copper color. No lacing (there wouldn't be at this ABV). 

Smell: Boozy - bourbon barrel notes, honey, toffee. Rich. 

Taste: Lots going on. Definitely some barleywine notes, with some bourbon, oak, vanilla, toffee, honey, orange, raisin, and some bitter notes at the finish as well. 

Mouthfeel: Surprisingly smooth for something this high in alcohol. Good thickness, no carbonation, dry finish, and only a little warming. 

Overall / Drinkability: I can see why some people describe this a more like a brandy than a beer, and I almost want to call it a Barleybrandy. It's got aspects of a Barleywine, but so much more. Glad I got a taste of it. Not sure I could finish a large glass of this though - definitely a slow sipping and savoring beer. Unique and quite tasty."
1206,DIM,Samuel Adams Utopias,4.65,"I opened a 2015 bottle about a month ago, this is my third pour. Time for a review.

I love how hybridized this is, it finds such a lovely grey area between beer and liquor. I can see calling this barleywine on steroids. Beautiful cogn/armagnac notes are most prominent but there is room for plenty more. Smokey wood and tobacco, raisin/plum schnapps?, plenty of brown liquor, hints of vanilla and honey, plus...just so much more. The body is wonderfully sticky and viscous.

Damn I wish I didn't like this as much as I do. There is just no way to justify buying another bottle, but this is absolutely worth trying once."
1207,TheMadJack,Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),4.22,"Poured room temperature from 12oz bottle into pint glass

Pour produced a vigorous light buff head that settled to about a quarter inch. Beer is an even walnut brown, cloudy, with amber highlights. Takes on a reddish tone towards the end as more light gets through.

Nose is rye bread, cola, raisins, plums, allspice. Understated, balanced. No bananas or yeasty funk. Dates and alcohol emerge during drinking. More esters escape as you drink as well, making this beer peak near the halfway point.

Taste is the real strong suit. Pumpernickel and mineral water base under demerera sugar, clove, and licorice. Alcohol comes forward on taste during drinking as it did on the nose. Also like the nose, the overall effect is of balance and restraint. 

Feel is full and crisp. Soda-like carbonation carries a weighty brew over the tongue.

Overall, a fine, unpretentious brew suitable to a variety of contexts and with no true faults, but like it's monastic brewers it doesn't dazzle. Were availability or price not concerns, this beer would be just at home next to pizza and wings as it is in at a holiday dinner."

After serving it, I could still smell it from two meters away.


I tried it and although it does not reach the Westy XII the only thing I can say while I continue to dislike it is that it is simply epic, well deserved fame."
1209,LiquidAmber,Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),4.3,"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a lightly hazy, medium to dark brownish orange with a fizzy, one finger khaki head that dissipates to patches with light lacing; a bit of particulates at the bottom of the glass despite a calm pour..Aroma of dry caramel malt, figs, raisins, dates and and some toffee. Flavor follows, with deep caramel malt, dried dark fruit, particularly dates and raisins, brown bread and cloves. Finishes a bit minierally but with residual dark fruit. Medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess. Has a much brighter flavor profile than any dubbel I've had before, almost a Belgian dark ale flavor. This is undoubtedly due to this having a bit of age to it with a best buy date of 2019, so likely about 8 years old. Probably my only chance to try this, so I grabbed a bottle. Despite the assumed lighter characater for aging, has a deep malt and great fruit notes. A slight sharpness (mineral) in the finish, but the residual fruit flavors make up for it. This makes me really want to try a fresher bottle, but I'm still impressed with the malty flavor depth of the 8; not quite a deep and malty as 12, but fine. A rare treat, I've wanted to try something from this brewery since I started my interest in craft beers and glad to try the dubbel and quad."
1210,Whyteboar,Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),4.53,"Poured more beige foam than walnut colored beer into the glass, so I guess the unknown age of the beer isn’t too old.
The aroma was pretty mild for me due to Covid messing with my sense of smell, but I did get some dark fruit and chocolate and spice. Had to be potent for me to get any of that!
The flavor was really, really good. Dark fruit and dark chocolate and a menagerie of spices that were all wrapped up in what seemed like champagne flavors and texture.
The feel was excellent, the massive head didn’t dissipate the carbonation that I could tell and somehow that is what made it all work together. Maybe the bite of the bubbles kept it from getting too sweet? Not sure. But darned good dubbel!"

1212,MutuelsMark,Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.44,Super dark like ink. Tannish head. Decent lacing. Nose is bourbonish but more hard charr on the nose. Doesn't smell as sweet as expected. Nice partially harsh initial flavor. Good warmth.
1213,defunksta,Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.36,"Appearance: Pours a completely dark, black color with a massive, deep, rich, and heavy tan head. SRM of 23. (4.50)

Aroma: Strong aromas of bourbon, chocolate, roast, coffee, vanilla. Smooth, rich, deep, and sweet.

Flavor: Strong flavors follow of rich chocolate and bourbon upfront. Smooth decidant chocolate, mixed with smooth coffee, vanilla, rich toffee, and maple syrup sweetness. Mild roastedness, and ultimatley sweet chocolate and syrup sweetness with a bourbon balance.

Feel: Heavier bodied, strong and soft carbonation to balance. Sweet, but smooth mouthfeel and hides the alcohol extremely well in the softness and smooth mouthfeel.

Overall: A World-Class rated BBA Imperial Stout. Not a big BBA person, but giving it a go. Strong chocolate, coffee, vanilla, maple syrup balanced by a smooth bourbon flavor. Incredibly smooth and soft. Hides the alcohol surprisingly well. Sometimes the bourbon and alcohol is overpowering. Not so here. Incredible Stout flavors balanced by smooth bourbon without any of the cloying alcohol or bourbon bite. Extraordinary flavors and mouthfeel. (Rating: 4.36)"
1214,Herbabee,Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.5,(out of the can into a sample snifter...) Tasty little thing... i think i'd like to match it up with the BA Narwhal for a blind taste-tester.
1215,John_M,Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.06,"On tap at Roscoe's today in PDX, this is the 2021 version.

The beer pours the expected blackish brown color with excellent head retention and lots of sticky lacing all around. This beer looks great. On the nose, this beer seems a bit lacking. There's coffee, licorice and burnt toast, but without much chocolate or bourbon (which I've gotten from fresh batches in the past). The flavor profile replicates the nose, and again, I'm not getting a lot of barrel character here. Mouthfeel is still pretty good... it's fairly full with a long, fairly smooth finish. Alcohol is very well integrated into the flavor profile, so drinkability is pretty good I guess 

This is a decent ba impy stout, but it's not a stand out. There are a lot of really good ba stouts on the market, and there's really nothing exceptional about this one. Not sure this is a beer I need to revisit any time soon."
1216,klarcbarr3,Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.9,"L= Black as a moonless night. Light tan two finger head. Gorgeous lacing from a thinning but substantive collar.
S= Delicious... bourbon, chocolate, caramel, licorice, spice.
T= Hops, chocolate, bourbon, malt sugar, all forward, coffee right behind. taste varies as it rolls over tongue. Strong, luscious flavors.
F= Spot on balanced... neither watery or sticky. Perfect.
O= This is one impressive brew. I might have a new favorite here."
1217,mactrail,Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.23,"It's not possible to add anything to the many thoughtful reviews of this stuff, but just for my own memory: Handsome dark brew, near black, with the beige foam and lacing in the Grand Cru goblet. Inviting aroma of cocoa and coffee. Sweet and malty with caramel and burnt sugar. The winey taste is complemented with figs and prunes. The moderate bitterness is enough to balance the sweet but keeps it highly sippable. This is my second favorite of the Big Stouts box from BA, next to the persimmon one. Not that there's much competition with all the peanut butter horrors."

Taste: Roasty, chocolate, brown sugar, dried dark fruit, prunes, raisin, vanilla, oak, bourbon.

Mouthfeel: Smooth, full bodied, with soft carbonation.

Overall: A very enjoyable and complex sipper full of great flavours."
1219,robwired,Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.45,"Poured into a snifter, what was canned 01/04/23 gave a healthy 1/4-inch beige head. Wafts of vanilla and bourbon came up from the glass.
First sip: smoky coffee. Inviting. As it settles on the palate, there's an oak, espresso, burnt sugar and bourbon reveal.
It has a creamy mouthfeel and finishes smooth with a sublimated booziness, all from a 12-ounce can."
1220,mjwellman,Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.93,"L: Pours black like coffee with a nice creamy mocha head
S: malty, sweet molasses aroma with a hint of bourbon

F: Smooth, like velvet. You take a sip and you want more. Not thin 
O: This is what an Imperial Stout should taste like. Wonderful beer that drinks smooth and it doesn't feel like a high ABV beer. I would buy this again."
1221,LeRose,Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.49,"Pours black with a surprising two fingers of brown head. It actually lasts quite a while, but eventually surrenders and becomes a few islands with a solid ring, pretty strong cling.

The smell is actually quite subdued to me. It's all there, but it doesnt seem to be eciting the glass with much urgency. Bourbon, great coffee and chocolate, roasty malts, a kind of caramel or molasses note, a light kiss of vanilla, wood.

The flavor explodes. Everything that should be in a stout of this ilk, nothing that doesn't belong, and everything in its place. Very good bourbon flavor leads the parade. There's a superbly smooth coffee taste that combines with milk chocolate for a kind of mocha effect. The chocolate lingers a bit on the lips. A little bitterness from the coffee but no acridity or unpleasant cherry taste. Not much char at all, in fact. There's a pleasing woodiness - I guess that is barrel presence. A bit of vanilla, slight touch of sweetness. Well after the swallow there is an aromatic spicy anise taste. All these flavors are extremely well-integrated.

Medium bodied, moderately carbed. It's not as dry as I thought it would be. Ultra-smooth, slightly bitter residual on the tongue while the licorice thing lingers as an aromatic. It occurs to me that it actually has a hard liquor feel to it.

I can sit here and dissect, but this beer just as easily lends itself to good old enjoyment in its totality. While the bourbon is strong, my fellow Jedi, it somehow doesn't dominate with a heavy hand. It's just unabashedly there in the foreground, but everybody else stands up loud and proud. This is some awesome sauce in a can. Well-crafted and it seems the barrel aging is flawless - deserves every bit of hype it gets, if ya ask me."
1222,hardy008,Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.77,"Pours dark black with a dark tan head with 2 fingers of foam from an aggressive pour. Has nice retention and lacing. Nice aroma with bourbon, chocolate, dark roasted malt and molasses. Tastes like it smells with the addition of coconut from the barrel aging. 

Full bodied, smooth and creamy. Moderate carbonation. There is quite a bit of molasses in the aftertaste. A wonderfully made beer."
1223,arcticsquare,Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,3.84,"Pours thin and dark. Fairly carbonated and fizzes quite a bit when sipping, which feels odd for a big stout. Dark maltiness with a dry bourbon finish. Serviceable imperial stout. Definitely improves after warming up a bit!"
1224,RanchMisfit,Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.93,What a stout should be… nice heavy drinking - fill my belly - rich - creamy smoothness. Tastes silky smooth across the tongue and down the hatch with zero bitterness and aftertaste. I could drink this everyday and never go to work again- Oskar Blues delivers and you won’t be disappointed.
1225,pulse,Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.32,"I believe this is #8 of the Extreme Stout Box, chosen by RNG. Ten FIDY pours black with a lovely khaki head, bubbly but fading rapidly into lacing. It has a noticeable enough aroma coming out of the can: malty, chocolately, molasses, espresso, burnt sugar. Taste is interesting. It's similar to the other stouts from the box I have had recently in that it is rather big and smooth but also not lacking in complexity despite being rather straightforward compared to the more outlandish adjunct-laden bombs that are everywhere these days. It is very warming - I feel that right away. The coffee-chocolate bitterness is quite prevalent out front. The malty backbone carries through to the end. I get the vanilla, caramel, and residual sweetness for sure. Solid body with moderate carbonation. Some dark fruit juice builds up with more sips.

For a box of extreme stouts, so many of these are terrifyingly drinkable."
1226,Greyvtrayn,Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.4,"Haven't rated a beer in a while...was excited to come across this one at the new Total Wines in Totowa. Grabbed a 4pk. Canned on 11/11/22. Rich, deep and dark brown with very modest but consistent mocha colored ring of foam, no real head and spotty but, scant lacing. 
The smell is pretty muted for me, definitely get some roasted malt and the bourbon has come out a bit as it warms. 
Strong roasted malt flavor, coffee-like. A nice smack of the barrel that lingers through the finish. A bit of oak, leather and unsweetened chocolate. 
Decent body and the sharpness from the booze is tolerable, it definitely lingers on the tongue and warms the gullet. 
An excellent beer for a chilly night."
1227,Treyliff,Jam The Radar,4.46,"2021 Release
550ml bottle poured into a snifter

A- pours jet black in color with a one-finger foamy khaki head that reduces to a ring around the edge

S- the glass is bursting with raspberry; raspberry jam, stewed raspberries, probably the most intense raspberry aroma i've smelled in a beer. Undertones of chocolate, vanilla & barrel that adds oak, bourbon a hint of caramel and an enhancing vanilla note

T- sweet chocolate and vanilla up front quickly gives way to bold berry notes of fresh pressed raspberry. Mid-palate brings out some oaky barrel notes that adds a caramel undertone. The finish turns tart with a blast of jammy raspberry, along with caramel and tootsie roll sticking around on the linger

M- medium body with moderate carbonation leads to a foamy mouthfeel that turns slightly creamy into a warming finish"
1228,sulldaddy,Jam The Radar,4.44,"Sampling a 2021 vintage bottle poured at cellar temp into my snifter. Been in my cellar for several weeks after receipt in a trade. Label says Batch 005, not sure that means anything. My bottle also says 14.56% ABV.

The beer pours a black coffee color and very fizzy but minimal tan head foams up and is gone instantly, leaving only the thinnest of edge layers as any evidence of carbonation.
Aroma on this beer is dark chocolate, brown sugar , a bit of bourbon, but surprisingly no raspberry notes. Hops absent on the nose and booze doesnt reveal any fusol notes on the aroma.
The first sip reveals a lighter body than expected, but still in the medium range. Texture is fairly smooth and doesnt have much stickiness to it. Carbonation is very fine, sort of fleeting and borders on being still. Id say overall the physical traits are not really what I expected from a bigger imperial stout. 
Flavor is chocolate bar and bourbon with a bit of cocoa powder dryness and then a blast of raspberries. WOW! That is fruity. The fruit dominates till I swallow and lingers also. Sort of a chocolate covered raspberry note with a creamy candy taste. I swear I keep getting banana, even though Im sure its the overabundance of raspberry tricking me.
Never any hop notes and the booze doesnt show up in bite or warming. Slightly dangerous, very big beer.
This in enjoyable, but if you didnt like raspberries, you may not like it. I enjoy them and grow my own each summer. Glad to have tried this beer."
1229,stortore,Jam The Radar,4.34,"500 ml bottle into a snifter. A 2023 release, had 6/30/23.

Pours an opaque dark brown, oily looking, with a brief flash of a head and no lacing. Aromas of chocolate, roasted malt, raspberries, vanilla, oak, some bourbon. The flavors match the nose- chocolate, raspberries, bourbon, roasted malt, vanilla, light oak. Smooth, a very good full body, appropriately carbonated. 

Straightforward, but very good. The add- ins star, the barrels are light. Good stuff."

Name: Jam The Radar
Brewery: Bottle Logic Brewing
Location: Anaheim, CA
Style: Imperial Stout
ABV: 13.5%
Date:10/05/22 
Jam the Radar is next on the review table. I have several different imperial stouts from Bottle Logic in my cellar, waiting for the review table and serving the beer at 50 degrees in a tulip glass. Pouring the liquid into the glass, it looks like 0-20W oil. The pour created a creamy two-fingered dark tan head with excellent retention. The slow dissipation left no lacing. The color is black, charting around SRM 38. Overall a near-perfect appearance for this stout with a high abv. 
Nosing the glass, I get bombarded with raspberries and bourbon; wow. Smelling the beer again, I detect caramel, molasses, dark chocolate, char, oak, oranges, fruity sweetness, coffee, and dark roasted bready malts. I love the way this beer smell. The raspberries are the star of the show. 
With the first sip, my mind has this supernova collision of flavor. I took another sip to ensure I was not lured by the siren song of drunk raspberries in an imperial stout. Alas, I was drifting away with flavor explosion on my palate. I taste boozy bourbon raspberries that are tarty, ripe, and juicy. The malty profile is roasted, bready, char, dark chocolate, espresso coffee, and caramel. Other flavors are fruity sweetness, oak, molasses, and a touch of oranges. 
The mouthfeel is thick, chewy, long, and pleasant. The body is heavy and has light carbonation. 
What an incredible beer. I have consumed a few raspberry beers of different styles, but I have yet to achieve this level of flavor. Bourbon-soaked raspberries in a bar of delicious dark chocolate and coffee-flavored beer are the best way to describe this—an absolute must-try for any dessert lover."
1231,TreyIsWilson,Jam The Radar,4.49,"A - Pours a thick motor oil black with a thin tan head. Very light soapy lacing.

S - Aroma is dark chocolate, ripe raspberries and huge bourbon barrel.

M - Medium body with medium carbonation. Creamy mouthfeel with a slick dry finish.

O - Really top notch."
1232,sweetbrew82,Jam The Radar,4.11,Bourbon soaked raspberries drizzled in chocolate with some espresso and dark fruits milling around in the mix. Didn't expect the raspberries to be so prominent and right upfront on the palate but they definitely are and it's a little too overpowering for me personally. The mouthfeel is spectacular though! It's so full bodied and chewy and viscous and oily that it just saturates every square inch of your tongue. Would've preferred the raspberries chill out in the background more but overall it's damn tasty!
1233,Christianriveraaa,Jam The Radar,4.29,"L: Poured from a bottle into a sniffer - 1-2 fingers length of foam risen, slight lacing left behind as it dissipates back into liquid form.
S: Getting the bourbon notes for sure along with chocolate, coffee. Slight aroma of dark fruits but I'm not getting much raspberries in there.
T: Getting the sweet raspberry bourbon taste for sure! Wow this is great. Getting notes of chocolate, dark fruits, raspberries, bourbon barrels. I gotta tip my hat and say this took me by surprise.
F: Heavy bodied beer, easy sipper, oily feel. 
O: This is a great barrel aged beer that I wasn't expecting to be so good based on the nose but man it was great. Would highly recommend if your a barrel aged stout drinker as this is a great experience to have."

1236,Smakawhat,Double Dry Hopped Double Citra Daydream,4.22,"Poured from the can into a Spiegelau IPA glass. 

Murky and opaque but not quite turbid dull lemon body. Kind of fleeting with a light lemon meringue pie custard look with a solid appearance. Bright white creamy forming head of thee fingers, and lots of solid cling and chunky lacing.

Bursting hop aroma. Dank earth with sweet spice tones and mixing bold citrus flavors of hop all at once. Dank orange peel madness is what it seems like in a can with a neutral malt presence to let everything shine. There's a touch of sugar here as well on the nose.

Kind of an interesting but unexpected experience. Light bodied but flirting with a real sense of wet mouthfeel. Rushing and very diverse hop flavors. Tropical sensing pineapple, spiced up herbs, and a slight touch of sweet milk seems to rush on first sip. Diversity still continues in the finish, pine and earth like richness with bitterness that mixes with a light touch of cream lactose for an added cut to the senses.

Still overall it comes off as just really solid, even crushable, but not mind blowing."

1239,Edgewise,Double Dry Hopped Double Citra Daydream,4.79,"I figured it out! Other Half made a deal with the devil!

Seriously, this brewery can do no wrong. If you can get their beers, do it now, because this seems like something that can't last. AMBEV is going to buyout this brewery and start producing mediocre IPAs to capitalize on the brand while they can. If there's anything I've learned after half a century on this planet, it's that extreme excellence cannot endure in the mortal realm.

Does the Double Dry Hopped Double Citra Daydream match my previous Other Half favorite, Citra + Mosaic? I'd have to match them head-to-head to be sure, but I think it exceeds its predecessor. There's just a tiny touch of sweetness that elevates this hoppy masterpiece above C+M. Maybe. If you can put one of each in front of me, I'll let you know for sure, and thank you enthusiastically in the process. The worst Other Half ales would easily qualify as the best beers of many other brewers. That is not an exaggeration. I've been enjoying everything I've bought from them in the last six months, and the Daydream may be a new pinnacle.

At this point, I should be giving you tasting notes and that kind of stuff. Nah. Just drink it yourself. It's a great NEIPA. Plato himself would call this a platonic NEIPA. Smooth. Citrusy. Smooth. Delicious. I'd give this a 5 on all accounts, but I want to give myself a little room in case God Himself decides to open a brewery. You never know."

Both are awesome. Life is good"
1244,Darkmagus82,Hop Bullet - Magnum Edition,4.18,"Poured from a can into a pint glass
Appearance -The beer pours clear golden color with a small head of white foam. The head has a good level of retention, fading over time and leaving a moderate level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – The aroma is strong of a pine and herbal hop smell with some orange citrus and a bit of tropical fruits. Along with these smells comes notes of grapefruit and a bit of bready malt and some hay smells.
Taste – The taste begins with cracker and bready malt backbone flavor matched with a decent showing of herbal and pine hop. There is a bit of grapefruit there as well, with the flavor getting more intense as the taste advances. All the while, some light harvest and citrus sweet tastes that were up front, begin to fade, while a touch of booziness comes along. Toward the very end, comes a surge of pine and a bit of earth, and with a light straw flavor that develops, one is left with a nice, slightly more dank, and quite easy natured and dangerous taste (for the abv.) taste to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is medium in thickness and creaminess with a moderate carbonation level. For the style and the tastes, the feel is well done and makes for a slow, but still easy drinking brew.
Overall – A rather nice, more dank, and very dangerously easy drinking brew with just a touch of abv. to warn you. Quite nice."

Almost-clear deep gold, with 3/8"" of ivory head, that leaves a thin ring, and no appreciable lacing. 

Smell is lemon,lime, orange rind, a bit of resinous pine, and slight spiciness. A bit of fresh, crackery malt is apparent from the open can. 

Taste is mostly slightly-sweet orange rind, and a smooth, rounded, pine flavor. There are hints of grapefruit, cracker, bread crust, and spiciness. Moderate , lingering bitterness, that doesn't slap you upside the head, but slowly builds towards finish and beyond. 

Feel is medium, smooth, lightly-slick, with light, very,very fine, soft carbonation tingle. 

Overall , a nice old-school DIPA. I'd especially recommend it with a meal. By itself, there's a lingering, almost-too-old quality to the citrus, that reminds me of orange juice, that's not quite spoiled, but is getting close. (Yeah. I realize beer is fermented. ;) ) That element takes it down a tick for me, but despite that, it's still an enjoyable experience. Just have to sip it, or combine it with food. (I am. ;) ) . Ymmv."

Nicely balanced despite the higher abv. Sweet and syrupy up front but finishes clean and bitter.

Taste - Follows the nose. Flavor starts with moderate pineapple and orange, with a bit of emerging grapefruit as it hits the mid-point. Solid bready malt backbone with a touch of toast. Light pine resin and a hint of black pepper come through in the finish. Aftertaste dances on the tongue with pineapple, grapefruit and pine.

Overall this has a softer rounded feel compared to the KBS base which we did a side by side. Adjuncts were subtly incorporated into KBS leaving a mild heat with a sweeter finish than KBS. Some of us called it disappointing but the sweet tooths that partook liked it better than KBS."
1253,tdm168,KBS - Spicy Chocolate,4,Pours black with a short brown head. The nose smells of chocolate and a hint of smoke and peppers. I'm not sure I would have noticed them if it hadn't been indicated on the label. The flavor has notes of tobacco and peppers up front followed by some smoke in the finish. The chocolate is there but subtle and balances things out. The barrel presence isn't a strong characteristic but there are some hints. There is some noticeable alcohol heat in the finish. Full bodied and well carbonated. Solid beer. Very flavorful. Not my favorite KBS variant but definitely one I would revisit.
1254,NCSapiens,KBS - Spicy Chocolate,4.22,"They added tons of chocolate and some ancho chilis to the breakfast stout. I have to disagree with the review immediately below, there is definitely hot pepper and it is clearly noticeable. Not that it is overly spicy, but there is a back heat that builds from the capsaicin. The beer improves as it warms. I wouldn’t say it is an improvement over KBS or the original breakfast stout, but it is a reasonable variant that is enjoyable."
1255,Victory_Sabre1973,KBS - Spicy Chocolate,3.69,"From a 12 oz bottle Bottled on 12-27-23

Great hiss upon opening and a good deal of smoke wafting out of the bottle. The pour of this beer is pitch black as expected, and nothing shines through when held up to light. I did an aggressive pour and that yielded a 3 finger brown head. The frothy and fluffy head didn't have good retention, though somewhat expected for the higher ABV. Just a very little bit of lacing on the glass. 
The nose is actually a bit weak, and I do have it served at room temp. I am getting some faint notes of chocolate, and coffee, but not much else. No spice, or pepper heat. 
Taste - There's a bit of chocolate in this beer. I do get some caramel and toffee notes as well. I am getting just the faintest hint of heat that comes in on the backside. I am a chili head, so I can handle the heat, but there's almost none. 
The body is pretty decent, I do get a faint bit of heat from the ABV of this beer. 
It's ok, but I was expecting a lot more from this beer. The base, and other variants are better in my book."
1256,Franziskaner,KBS - Spicy Chocolate,4.15,"Black in color with a fingernail of brown on top. The aroma is of chocolate, chiles, coffee, and bourbon. I’m tasting chocolate, chiles, bourbon, and coffee. The mouth is warm with the chiles and silky smooth."

T-Chocolate, cinnamon, vanilla, chilies, bourbon, fudge, cherries

O- reminds me of the cinnamon vanilla variant with some chilis thrown in....better than the recent letdowns by Founders with the cherries or blueberries ...solid but not outstanding.....below the Mackinac and coffee"
1258,LiquidAmber,KBS - Spicy Chocolate,4.21,"Poured into a Fremont small snifter. Pours a very dark mahogany brown, appearing opaque in the glass with a quarter finger dark khaki head with good persistence and light lacing. Aroma of dark toasted malt, coffee, bakers chocolate and mild green and hot pepper. Flavor is dark toasted malt, Americano coffee, milk chocolate, green pepper and some hot pepper heat in the finish. Medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess. A somewhat mellow KBS with some hot pepper character, as promised. It's been while since I've had the base stout, but this one seemed a little dialed back in flavor, more like a moderate milk stout. The chili pepper is deftly handled, with some light fresh pepper taste throughout and a nice, light, but spicy presence in the finish. Coffee, as always is nicely balanced and flavorful. A bit mellow, but the flavor is delightful and well integrated. I guess I'm due for an update on the original KBS. This is one of the iconic stouts and the variants have been fine."
1259,dd53grif,KBS - Spicy Chocolate,4.1,Pours a dark brown color with virtually no head. Spicy aroma of roasted malts. Taste starts with a spicy kick followed by a nice alcohol warmth. Spiciness fades quickly so the heat doesn't grow as the glass empties.
1260,robwired,KBS - Spicy Chocolate,4.39,"It poured a frothy cloud of a head that took its time going down in my 2018 KBS glass. There's some webby lacing.
The nose is definitely spicy chocolate. The taste follows with the chili pepper notes first. There's chili heat from those.
The flavor increases with coffee and chocolate in a smooth, creamy mouthfeel. The finsih has heat from chili and ABV."

1262,dpc166,Aecht Schlenkerla Erle,4.82,"This beer is darn near perfect.

500mL can from Lower Merion Beverage, Ardmore PA.

Pours a beautiful dark brown as any Schwarzbier should be with great clarity and 2 fingers of tan head

Smell is amazing. Alder smoked malt that is heavenly. Aroma like you are smoking meats, but not overpowering.

Taste is divine. Smooth lager characteristics and balanced with smoke. Smoke does not cause astringent aftertaste.

Best beer I've had from Schlenkerla to date. Been wanting to try the Cherry wood, but can't find it. If you love smoke, you have to get this."
1263,AElfwine_Nerevar,Aecht Schlenkerla Erle,4.1,"No date on the bottle.

L: The beer pours a beautiful ruby brown color with excellent clarity. The pour yields three fingers of fine, tan head with good retention slowly falling to a nice 6 mm cap. As the beer recedes in the glass it leaves a nice ringed and webbed lacing on the glass.

S: There is a light note of smoked meat upfront that quickly dissipates into a smoked malt character. This one is not as aggressively smokey as Schlenkerla's other rauchbiers as I am getting a more woody aromatic character than pure wood smoke. I also get roasted malt character, roasted kola nut, bready notes, light earthy herbal notes, and a bit of spiciness. As the beer opens up I get the slightest impression of dark fruits hiding behind the wall of roasted grains and smoked malt.

T: Smoked malt, woody notes (of alder wood I guess?), roasted malt, Kola nut, brown bready notes, herbal, earthy, and a nice bitter spiciness on the finish.

F: Medium body with medium carbonation. The mouthfeel is velvety smooth with a nice light dryness on the finish.

O: This is a nice mashup of the Rauchbier and Schwarzbier. Not as sweet as other beers from Schlenkerla and presents a nice balance between the smoked and roasted aspects of the malt bill. There is no residual sweetness but as the beer warms up I start to get a bit of sweet dark fruit character, but not enough to overcome the hoppy bitterness on the finish. If you like Rauchbiers and Schwarzbiers you will not find much to criticize here."
1264,cjgiant,Aecht Schlenkerla Erle,4.28,"On tap;
Dark with a light tan head that the pourer left a finger of. Lacing is strong initially, and a thick collar lasts and a solid cover can be summoned with a simple swirl.

Unlike some other reviews I’ve seen, I can not get a lot of the smoke that is obviously there in the taste. The nose is pretty light to me. The beer itself starts on a dark chocolate with a fuzzy tingle from the carbonation. It feels thicker than it weighs, with a robust nature that I think the smoke is bumping up. The smoke and roasted malts work together to bring a woody bitterness than drifts towards a doused campfire. The pair go hand-in-habd to the finish, with the smoke providing more of a charred than roasted malt flavor.

To me, this is so nicely put together giving me a darker roast Schwarzbier with a nice level of smokiness to bump up the robustness just a tad."
1265,Bouleboubier,Aecht Schlenkerla Erle,4.32,"(500 ml can, no date/code; purchased single off shelf at State Line yesterday... poured into my 0.5 l Weihenstephaner mug)

L: two-finger+ high, rouge-tinged tan, dense, spongy foam stand atop medium-dark brown liquid... little lace, but steady cap

S: campfire, hint of caramelized clove, pan-toasted espresso beans... notes of thyme, fig... with more head built, toasted brown bread... as the palate becomes tuned in, wood smoke dominates

T: almost amaro-like with the burnt, woody/rooty elements playing against the herbaceous, vaguely floral hops and roasty dark grain... just missing underlying sweetness; it's relatively dry (arguably a touch too), aside from hints of toasted dark sugars... yeah, the aftertaste has a herbal-spice, cola thing

F: smooth textured; rich but not rounded in the middle, dense but not thick... soft smoky singe stokes a lil stinging tingle in the aft... its body says dopplebock, but the backdraft heat never surfaces

O: the description had me hoping this was a clone or homage to Alaskan Smoked Porter... similar flavors, but less emphasis on strength and sweetness... not surprisingly more rauchbier than schwarzbier, though the character of the latter certainly does provide significant color to its background... I could do with more of this (2260)"

1268,BeerAndGasMasks,Aecht Schlenkerla Erle,4.1,"From the pint can, it pours a dark, but not stygian dark, black color with a modest light tan head that slowly reduces and leaves lacing. The nose gets a nice smokiness, followed by the mouth getting a nice smoke flavor that is less bacony than their regular beer."
1269,John_M,Aecht Schlenkerla Erle,4.15,"Poured from a cold bottle, the beer pours a blackish amber color with fairly decent head retention and light lacing. On the nose one gets smoked meat, a bit of char, light licorice and a hint of vanilla. The flavor profile generally replicates the nose, but with some nice underlying sweet malt to help balance the smoke. The combination of different flavors works very well in this beer. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, but there's no drop off in flavor. Considering the modest abv. in this beer, it's impressive how much flavor this beer delivers. The beer has a fairly long finish, dominated by the smoke and sweet malt. Alcohol is virtually undetectable, and drinkability is really pretty good. Especially for a smoked beer. I could session a beer like this.

Impressive beer from the talented brewers at Schlenkerla."
1270,Viaduck,Bourbon County Brand Backyard Stout (2023),4.59,"Very heady for its ABV. Very fragrant aroma: vanilla, berries, bourbon. Sweet & delicious: lots of vanilla, berries, bourbon, brown sugar. Thick & smooth as velvet. A bit weak on carbonation but enough alcohol hidden behind the sweetness to occupy the taste buds. Overall: the horses ate the mulberries on the trees around here. I’ll just have to make do with Backyard Stout."

1272,REVZEB,Bourbon County Brand Backyard Stout (2023),3.94,"Another remake this year of a previous iteration I stumbled upon and loved before living in chicagoland. How would this compare? Usual pitch black pour with a dark brown cap. Big chocolate and tart berries meeting molasses forward barrel in nose. Taste is not great in comparison, tart and now pithy berries start, before bourbon and malt try to take over but fail, leaving berry guts and bitterness. Feel is thinner than most bcbs, somewhat astringent, tartness lingers on the palate. Disappointing since the orignal was a great variant"
1273,puck1225,Bourbon County Brand Backyard Stout (2023),4.25,"Poured this beer from a bottle into a teku glass. Very dark brown color with a brief effervescent brown head and a smidgen of lacing. Boozy smell and taste with sweet berries, dark chocolate and bourbon. Hint of vanilla and warm spices. I think the feel could be a bit fuller. Still a nice warming beer."
1274,beergoot,Bourbon County Brand Backyard Stout (2023),4.05,"Opaque and dark, both with the pour and in the glass; no head per se, just a partial wire-thin ring of foam inside the glass. Great aroma; dark roasted grain and dark chocolate infused with subliminal notes of berries. Very fine flavors working on the palate; dark milk chocolate and brownies with hints of blueberries; a nice hint of bourbon in the background. Heavy body; silky smooth; light stickiness clings to the palate.

The addition of multiple berry varieties is a very nice aspect of this beer. Still, it seems a bit half-hearted in the feel (and definitely the appearance). It does improve as it warms up, but it's hardly extraordinary.

1277,Thankin_Hank,Bourbon County Brand Backyard Stout (2023),5,Backyard is cold coffee black. No head but some carbonation. Smells like marshmallows dripping with molasses and sweeter than a cheerleader's thighs. Taste is dark chocolate alcohol molasses and amazingly as smooth as that cheerleader's thighs. Maybe some nuttiness more than fruit. No bad aftertaste or lingering yuckiness. The alcohol is not hidden but doesn't linger either for 12.9%. My tongue is liking it. Ima drink this whole bottle.

M - Light syrupy body with warming in the back of the throat.

O - Don't know how else to describe it but it works."
1280,AmeriCanadian,Bourbon County Brand Backyard Stout (2023),4.3,"Gorgeous pinkish hue on the edges of an otherwise typically-fantastic looking BCBS body. Mocha head with little retention but lots of sticky, splotchy lacing. Big alcohol legs. This thing looks sticky and chewy.

Chocolate covered berries up front. Absolutely decadent. Raspberries, cherries, blueberries, just pure jam. Covers up some of the usual wonderful barrel notes, but they’re still there in the background. Not as rich and layered a nose because of that. But it’s exactly what you’d hope for given the description.

Taste follows exactly but is wonderfully tart and a little drier than I expected. Delectable dark chocolate and dark fruits, espresso, cacao nibs, toffee, wine tannins, and jam toast. Extremely clean finish with a bit of hop bite. Lasting bitterness even with coated teeth and tongue.

Much thinner than it looks but silky smooth and coating. Drinks dangerously easy.

Not the best BCBS variant I’ve had, but spot-on for what’s advertised and one I would gladly revisit again and again. I could actually drink a whole bottle of this one on my own with little trouble, which isn’t always true for the more exotic variants."

Pours dark amber with about a finger of dense, light khaki-colored head, settles into a thick skin, moderate active carbonation. Smell is toffee, pine resin, grapefruit rind, maybe a little whiff of nuts. Smells great.

Taste is all that again, maybe in a different order. Pine resin and grapefruit rind are very bright, toffee is slightly burnt and brings a lovely sweetness.

Mouthfeel is satisfyingly hefty, not sticky but weighty. Overall, this is super good and exactly what I was looking for."

1286,GeorgianBayPackr,Double Nugget Nectar,4.22,"wow, easy drinking...nice mellow approach with upfront malty sweetness, nice hop mid-palate, and smooth, sweet, grainy-bread beer finish. Excellent"
1287,Ernald_Elbertson,Double Nugget Nectar,3.76,"Looks and feels right, but the taste is unrecognizable from anything resembling Nugget Nectar. Do not expect a similar beer; the malt character almost completely dominates while regular Nugget Nectar is a hop-forward beer. 

First, this beer lacks several of the hops present in Nugget Nectar; Warrior, Tomahawk, and Palisade are gone and replaced with Azacca and Columbus. Warrior and Tomahawk missing actually cuts back significantly on the bitterness. Furthermore, Flaked Oats are added to the malt bill (but this might actually help with making the beer less syrupy). The combination of the insanely strong malt and Columbus hops with a lack of bittering hops make it more like an aged Imperial West Coast IPA. 

Ultimately this beer is far less bitter and much more malty than Nugget Nectar. There are hints of Nugget Nectar in here thanks to the Nugget hops, but it's like a distant relative. That being said, it isn't bad. If you like Double Two Hearted, this is a very similar experience but a little more fruity."
1288,vette2006c5r,Double Nugget Nectar,4.31,"Double Nugget Nectar pours a clean dark red with a large, long-lasting head. The aroma is harsh hop notes, a bit of earth, and honey.

Even though I really appreciate the new artwork that some of their classic brands are sporting, I love that they are still rocking the old art for this one, except now on pint cans with an awesomely textured paint! Still, I don't think I ever got to try any of the original releases of this particular IPA, so you know I had to jump on this 2024 drop.

The ale's appearance is lightly chill fogged orange-amber with a tall, puffy head of khaki foam.

Flame licked orange zest and liqueur meet resinous pine while remaining quaffably foamy with crisp flavors due to a barely perceptible malt. What's there is mildly toasty, but this is an assertively aggressive blast from FFF catalogue's past that, to my palate, resurfaces a latent appreciation for well done, aggressively bitter and slightly boozy, clean American hops without going overboard. Because despite all that potency, citruses and even some tropics continue to explode all throughout the session. It's even a bit stonefruity."

Awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical/earthy hops and dark/bready malt flavors; with an awesome malt/bitterness balance; and no cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Medium carbonation and fairly full body; with a very smooth, creamy/silky/bready/sticky, fairly resinous/rindy, and lightly slick/syrupy mouthfeel that is great. Mildly increasing warmth of 9% after the finish. Overall this is an awesome DIPA. All around awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical/earthy hops and dark/bready malt flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to sip on for the big ABV, with the mellowly bitter/resinous/drying finish. Great soft feel for the ABV, and not overly aggressive. Feels like a lot of Warrior, Columbus, Chinook, and Summit. Very juicy, vibrant, dank, and earthy hops; with a large sized dark/bready malt backbone. Light residual sweetness with lingering resin dryness. A really enjoyable offering, and impressive style example. Held up extremely well for the age. Reminds me of SN Bigfoot a lot at this point, but already was expecting that."

Feel: Heavier body, appropriate, carbonation, smooth and sweet. (4.25) 

Overall: A big Stout from Founders. I'm not a fan of coffee in beer but also know Founders makes great beer so sort of reluctantly picked this one up. I also don't like them too sweet or with artificial flavorings such as hazelnut. 
However, this is a nice surprise. It drinks exactly as described. Fudge balanced by hazelnut coffee. The difference here is that all the flavors melt together well without any of the artificial sweetness I get in these type of beers so often. It's a perfect stout balanced by just the right amount of coffee. Sort of like an imperial version of their Breakfast Stout. I've learned not to underestimate Founders. This is a fantastic Stout. . (Rating: 4.19)"
1304,ryan1788a5,Stay In Stout,3.99,"12oz bottle poured into a snifter.

A: Completely black pour with three fingers of light brown head. Retention is very solid and long-lasting. Eventually it settles into a half inch creamy foam with lacing that clings in ring-like sheets.

S: Deep and rich fudgey aromas. German chocolate cake, fudge sauce, dark chocolate truffles. Coffee pokes out from behind the thickly layered chocolate to briefly bring a rich mocha and hazelnut note. Salted caramel chews and hints of smoke. Soft bourbon, nougaty oak vanillins. Hazelnut coffee begins to pull forward more with warmth.

T: Follows the nose. Big wave of chocolate sauce, fudge, and nibs up front. Very rich and sweet. Coffee is more assertive than the nose initially let on, and it firmly owns the mid palate and helps to balance with bitterness. Lots of mocha, gas station hazelnut coffee, smoke, and beans. Brief interjection of hop bitterness. Bourbon rides up and takes center stage briefly with some wet barrel character. Not as assertively as it does in KBS, but enough to be a definite factor. Char and nougaty vanillins, caramel chews. The barrel flavors stay front and center through an off dry finish.

M: Rich, decadent, and creamy, if not a hair thinner than expected. Very airy and velvety texture with a whipped feel. Carbonation is maybe a bit too apparent with that carbonic seltzery bite that begins to distract just a little. It does add lots of lift so that nothing ever comes close to being sticky or weighty. Brush of bourbon warmth and spice and an ever so slight astringency, likely mostly from coffee.

O: It's firmly desserty, but well put together and surprisingly drinkable for the size of it. It's actually pretty amazing how sweet the chocolate expression seems to hit the palate, and yet it doesn't feel anything close to syrupy or cloying. It stays nicely off dry throughout. This is the key to a good pastry stout/dessert stout. If I can't bring myself to finish the bottle for fear of diabetes, the brewer failed. This, in contrast, is a win on that front. My one problem is that the body is lacking a bit and the carbonation it a bit much. For another mild point of criticism, I will say that it doesn't come across as particularly creative or different, either. It feels rather close to a few other beers they've done at this point. Like they took Hazelnut KBS and played with the ingredient slider a little to iterate on it, while losing some body. Still, it's decent enough that good is good and I'm satisfied with the drinking experience even if it doesn't seem like a particularly novel concept and even if they didn't ""stick the landing"" as well as they usually do."
1305,HoppingMadMonk,Stay In Stout,4.41,"Motor oil black appearance. 
Medium light carbonation with about a medium body that has a bit of a slick oily feel.
Aroma is a huge hit of chocolate and hazelnut in a very pleasant way. Theres also malt,roasted malt, with a little mocha in the background. 
Tqste definitely has some sweetness but its not syrupy or sugary. Chocolate and hazelnut is out front with the oil from the hazelnut adding and interesting flavor.
Its a great dessert beer"

Nose fair amount of the base stout, some roast, dark chocolate, plenty of hazelnut, a bit biscuity cookie like, caramel, a little fudge, vanilla, starting to get a bit artificial, mild sweet hazelnut coffee in the background

Taste is a bit watery and milky surprisingly, but plenty of hazelnut, coffee, coffee milk, some chocolate wafer cookie, touch of bitterness, vanilla, some fudge cookies, hint of caramel, no real barrel notes though, condensed milk, touch of alcohol, a touch of roast, more coffee milk late with a lactose like drying finish, a bit sticky

1308,JJKBeerLvr,Stay In Stout,4.55,"Poured from a bottle into pint glass in January 2024. There was a bottled on date of 11/27/2023 @ 15:39, so the beer was less than 2 months old.

Appearance: Very dark black with a thick dark brown head. Head was about 2 fingers high, and lasted a minute. It leaves only a little lacing on the glass, and ended with a very thin tan head still on the beer.

Smell: Excellent aroma mix of chocolate/fudge, coffee, and bourbon, in that order. There is also some vanilla, caramel, and some other sweet aroma like black licorice, but overall the coffee and chocolate dominate the others. It is a very nice balance of aromas, and I expected the bourbon to dominate, which it did not.

Taste: There is a nice balance between the coffee, bourbon, and sweetness like chocolate and licorice flavors. The chocolate/fudge flavor is pronounced. There is some smokie roasted flavors, some caramel and vanilla flavors to enhance the taste and add some complexity. There is a strong alcohol presence, which matches the 10.6% on the label, but it is balanced nicely by the sweetness. The taste is an excellent mix.

Mouth-feel: Thick like liquid licorice, but with a smooth body. Not overly smooth like a Milk Stout.

This is an excellent, complex, Imperial Stout, and it has a variety of flavors that adds a nice complexity to the beer. Although this is a big beer, it is very smooth and enjoyable to drink. This chocolate sweetness nicely contrasts the bourbon flavor, and is a nice balance to the high alcohol content. This is very similar to their ""KBS - Maple Mackinac Fudge"". I prefer the regular KBS and also Founder's CBS since the chocolate in this version overshadows the other flavors a little too much. Still, this is one of my favorite Founder's stout, and one of my favorite stouts overall. I just wish it was not so expensive."
1309,TreyIsWilson,Trolls Trolls Trolls,4.28,"A - Pours pitch black with a one finger creamy tan head. Medium amount of clingy lacing.

S - Aroma is vanilla, dark chocolate and bourbon.

T - The taste starts with the sweet vanilla upfront followed by dark roasted coffee, cocoa nibs, roasted malts, charred oak and some nice bourbon heat in the finish.

M - Medium body with medium carbonation. Creamy mouthfeel with a soft drying finish.

O - Really nicely done. Tons of barrel."
1310,JohnniEMc,Trolls Trolls Trolls,4.34,"Against good judgment, the request was made to be served with a full pint. Through the clear glass, the color is very dark brown, but not the black coffee brown of many stouts. The very modest head is almost milk chocolate brown. The vanilla and barrel tannins combine to make almost a chocolate like aroma to accompany the roasted malt. This has a big taste. There is some alcohol, but it's not overly harsh. The tannins are subtle and the vanilla stands up to them and the rest of the flavors. But, this one is mostly about the mouthfeel. It is as rich and viscous as any beer that doesn't add other extras, like lactose. There wasn't much glass lacing, but that's common for something with this much alcohol. Overall, it's a very good Imperial Stout, with an amazing mouthfeel and a very good taste."
1311,BEERchitect,Trolls Trolls Trolls,4.46,"Will all that dark lord practice under their belt, 3 Floyds now steps down from those lordly pedestals and provides an imperial stout rolled with vanilla and slumbered in bourbon barrels that does under the belts of mere peasants.

Riding the line of very dark brown and espresso black, the viscous Trolls Trolls Trolls hits the nose with an intense boozy scent that carries sweeter bourbon, dark roast coffee, soft spices, caramelization and a savory smoky chocolate unsubtle nuances. Expectedly sweet in taste, the early palate coats in whisky soaked caramel, toffee, chocolate and cream for a nearly boozy milkshake consistency.

With its creamy sweetness slow to fade, the rise of roast brings those espresso flavors to the forefront of taste. Lightly smoky, heavy toast, walnut and smoldering embers shine while the bourbon flavors of caramel, vanilla, coconut and nutty oak lurk closely behind. Trending warm with whisky, more subtle fruitiness of dark, dried and pitted fruits allow for a mild sherry taste to greet the late palate.

Full, chewy and off-cloying, the stout finishes malty and pleasantly heated to make this stout a slow sipping affair. A long and savory aftertaste of bourbon and vanilla are surpassed only by the chocolaty roast that lingers well into the next indulgent sip."

1315,Victory_Sabre1973,Broccoli Special Reserve - Freaky Friday,4.55,"From a 16oz can packaged on 1/22/24

Hazy and murky pouring beer. Dank looking and there's no way you can see through this beer. I get a 1 finger white and frothy head from this beer. Great head retention, and there's some lacing on the glass. 
The aroma of broccoli hits hard.... Ok, seriously, I do get a ton of hop aromas from this beer. They started hitting me when pouring this beer. Nice and tropical smelling. When I get up close I get tons of mango in this beer, a great hit of grapefruit, hints of pineapple as well show up. This is a very aromatic beer. 
Taste - The hops hit and hit hard right out of the gate. Lots of pineapple flavor, which is a lot stronger than i got on the nose. There's grapefruit bitterness as well. The mango sweetness also is there. The flavors seem in opposite order in strength than the nose suggested. 
The body is quite soft feeling, and I have to wonder if they used oats in this beer. Juicy feeling as well. Hop feeling lingers in my throat. 
I may be somewhat burnt out on this style of beer, but when one is done well, I love it. This is well made and, as I'm burping up hops, I am happy."

Hazy, opaque, pale gold color in the glass. Bright white head with lacing along the goblet.
Flavourwise, the bitter, punchy hop character is highlighted when consumed from the can. When decanted, the sharpness is blunted and you get many more floral and soft tropical fruit notes. Depending on what you are in the mood for you have a couple different options with this beer.
I tend to prefer a more aggressive and sharp profile. Straight from the can this delivers that. The softer, more gentle profile from decanting is a pleasant surprise.
I was delighted to encounter this collab, especially so near the canning date as I imagine this will not age well.

Overall: A new release from Toppling Goliath Broccoli Special Reserve, which is a recipe clone of Other Half's Broccoli Special Reserve. Standard hops with the addition of Hallertau Blanc. It does great things for this beer. It has tons of lime, green grape, melon, and lychee flavors. Leans sweet, but incredibly smooth and drinkabe for the higher ABV.

1321,BEERchitect,Broccoli Special Reserve - Freaky Friday,4.06,"Showing the freakier side of their relationship, Toppling Goliath and Other Half swap recipes to see how Toppling Goliath looks in Other Half's clothes.

Tarnish lemon in color, the lightly silted Freaky Friday- HDHC Broccoli Special Reserve edition lifts an eggshell froth up to the rim in order to push out a fruity display of citrus, tropical fruit, pine and hay. With a sweeter start to the session, the early palate opens up with bread, biscuit and a drier shortcake character.

As the bed of malt is laid on the middle palate, the hops billow onto the tastebuds with white grapefruit, bitter orange and lemon. Not to be outdone, the citrusy flavors are met with the rinds of mango, pineapple and kiwi in a more tropical display. Trending bitter with the boldness of pine resins, fresh grass clippings, chive and geranium, the ale takes a decidedly bitter turn.

Medium bodied and starting out more hazy-like, the session finishes more traditional with prized bitterness to overtake the fruit in an extended aftertaste of spruce, peppery grasses and dankness."
1322,TooManyGlasses,Ruination IPA,4.36,"Single purchased from Trader Joe’s in Oceanside,CA.
Pours a brilliantly clear orange golden with scant white head (though did pour slowly).
Aroma is piney, citrus, with some floral notes as it warmed - a bit earthy and dank.
Taste hits the palate with a pale malt sweetness that quickly succumbs to the hop explosion of pine, grapefruit peel, and an aggressively earthy bitterness.
Full coating mouthfeel with moderate carbonation and an earthy and piney bitterness that lingers forever."

Great smell when opening the can and mouthfeel is fantastic. Smooth drinking - you’ll never know that this is an imperial ipa. Alcohol is hidden and easy to drink. I might need another six pack!
1324,Rednekhippie,Ruination IPA,4.28,"Just tried the new 2024 release of Ruination. Poured into a glass from the gold can. Color is bright and clear golden yellow with a very thin white head that dissipated quickly. Aroma is clean and not noticeably floral. This leads me to believe it is not the OG recipe. The taste is also not floral but pleasantly bitter. My memory of previous Ruinations is a more earthy bitterness with considerably more on the nose. Don’t get me wrong, I’m glad I managed to snag three sixers of the new release. It is definitely a double IPA worth the name and I will likely pick up a couple more. This is a well executed albeit one dimensional IPA."

Complex flavors upfront. Both malty, crackery, herbal, some subtle apple flavors -almost a caramel apple sauce. some subtle sweetness, maybe like a canary melon might provide. Big mouthfeel and carbonation keeps crispness and smoothness at bay. Bitter finish, with some white pepper spice that which lingers on the tongue.

Notes via stream of consciousness: So what makes a Polish Pilsner a Polish Pilsner other than it's being a Pilsner brewed in Poland? I've heard it's got to be brewed with Polish hops but I don't know. Anyway, it's poured a mostly clear (I can't see my fingerprints through the glass) deep golden body beneath an inch of rocky white foam. The aroma is herbal, floral, and grainy/malty. It's clean and pleasant. On to the taste... as you might expect it follows the aroma. The herbal character from the hops is strong, and the bitterness is quite firm. The malt is grainy but a little dull, and it finishes dry with herbal and floral hop notes lingering nicely. The body is medium-light and it's gently crisp. To top things off the head has dropped but remains a creamy, complete surface covering. surface covering. The lacing is limited but at least there's some there. All in all this is a decent, well put together, nicely balanced, and highly quaffable Pilsner.

1333,BeerAndGasMasks,Rotmistrz Polish Pilsner,3.53,"From the half liter can, it pours a clear light golden color with a very large white head that slowly reduces - very pilsner like! The nose gets some light spice. The mouth gets a bit of spice as well, with a nice malt base. While I am not sure what a ""Polish Pilsner"" is, this is reasonably good."
1334,Beginner2,Rotmistrz Polish Pilsner,3.83,"From a box of ten different European Beers imported by a firm I never heard of before. But they smartly curated for Costco where I bought the box. Somewhat similar to the curated-for-Costco Kalea's Advent Calendar, these ten European Beers all cannot be found in the U.S. Using Costco's excellent distribution network, I like this beer importing model seemingly circumvents -- or at least simplifies-- state interference and expands the number of European micros that can compete in the North American market.

Rotmistrz' micro, Malcom, is near the Polish/Czech border; indicating the authenticity I taste instead of just an imitation Pils. Malcolm does not have a website listed on BA, but I will root around for it when I review its IPL also in the box.

Poured into my BA Respect Beer glass, this Polish Pils has good color; but only short-lived foam and no lace. Smells are mostly malt, with a hint of hop aroma in the back of my nose. Taste is well-balanced as the bitter hops don't dominate until the semi-dry finish. (A common complaint of mine about the Czech pils style is the hops tend to dominate from the attack and don't stop.) Medium-mouthed mostly. Worked well to wash down a lunch of Taiwanese noodles with bean paste."
1335,DarkLordScott,Big Hearted IPA,3.98,"Pours clear pale yellow with a two finger head leaving lovely lace behind. Aroma is citrus.

1336,walser,Big Hearted IPA,4.01,"19oz can from Wegmans. In a plastic wine glass. Great color and head. Great lacing and mouthfeel. Slightly floral but lager-esque for such a high imperial abv. Only drawback is the nose, slightly acidic and alcoholic though dissipates after resting. Reminds me of Ithaca's Flower Power but done with such a strong abv makes it kind of remarkable in the high imperial abv craze class. One of the better mass produced examples out there. Very drinkable and enjoyable."

Tall,m frothy and clotted white head left curtains of lace as it fell.
The aroma is weak but sort of sweet with nice citrus hop notes. 
Flavor is a bold and balanced mix of raw grain malt nuttiness, sweet hints of honey and a mild pine pitch bitterness. A bit of astringent metalic tang keeps this from a 4.5 in flavor for me. 
Medium bodied at most this is a very easy drinkin' big beer.
Clean dry finish with a lingering herb and leather aftertaste.

1343,Darkmagus82,Breakaway Blonde Ale,3.74,"Poured from a can into a pint glass
Appearance -The beer pours a clear golden color with a small head of white foam. The head has a good level of retention, fading over time and leaving tons of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – The aroma is strong of a biscuit malt and caramel smell mixed with aromas of a light lemon and herb. Along with these smells comes a touch of apricot and a bit of hay.
Taste – The taste begins with biscuit and cracker malt flavor mixed with a touch of citrus sweetness of orange. Along with these tastes comes a little bit of grain and a hint of hay. As the taste advances a little bit more grain and a hint of coriander join in, and with a loss of the sweet, one is left with a rather crisp taste to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is light with a higher level of carbonation. For the style and easy drinking nature of the brew the feel is good and makes for a nice easy sipper.
Overall – A good easy natured session brew, great for summer."

1350,teromous,Breakaway Blonde Ale,3.54,"This is a bottle from the Prime Time Variety Pack. It has a notch in the label for 'JUN"" with ""FRESHNESS MATTERS. ENJOY BEFORE MONTH NOTCHED"" printed below it. There is dotted text on the bottle neck: ""JUN 2024 P 340 3 1338 66W""

Appearance: The body of the beer is a medium-light shade of gold with brilliant clarity. It has a short fluffy pure white head that has good retention. It leaves some spots of lacing on the glass. It is a picture perfect beer.

Aroma: There is a light aroma of cereal grains which is intertwined with a very light herbal hop note. The aroma is very mild but good. The cereal grains stand out the most.

Taste: Up front there is a slightly dusty cereal grain flavor and a slight twinge of nondescript fruity flavor. The middle of the palate has a bit of an herbal hop flavor to it, which carries to the finish of the beer. The aftertaste has a bit of cedar character which is nice.

Mouthfeel: It is crisp and light bodied, which is a bit of a departure from the style but the beer still works as a whole and the crispness seems to help the flavors pop a bit more.

Overall: In a nutshell the beer is a good beer option for anyone who might be looking for something a bit lighter. While it is crisper and lighter bodied than a typical Blonde Ale, it still drinks well and provides some pleasant aromas and flavors. The rear label states that this is ""BALANCED AND CLEAN, WITH A SUBTLE HOP TOUCH AND QUICK REFRESHING FINISH"" which is a fairly accurate description. The beer does feel clean and the crispness helps give it a refreshing finish. 

I probably wouldn't buy this beer too often but it's a decent addition to a variety pack. I would recommend it more to those who enjoy light beers with a caveat that it isn't a typical Blonde Ale that has a smooth and more weighty body."
1351,DrDemento456,White Chocolate Ale (2024),4.3,Darker than normal blonde ale which is to be expected being brewed with coffee best part of this beer is the Vanilla it taste so strong and delicious like pure Madagascar bean followed by toffee sweetness and then some coffee notes. Very sweet so watch out if this is not your thing but to me its excellent. Body is a bit slick medium but 8% goes down easy. Overall I know of a place that has four packs of this so I might actually go back and get some more if its only 16 bucks
1352,DarkLordScott,White Chocolate Ale (2024),3.63,"Pours gold with a good, quick head and average carbonation. Aroma is white chocolate and grain. Taste is light, smooth with a chocolate profile. There is a twist of something like lemon peel at the end. All in all, not too bad, though there are better variants of the limited release series out there."
1353,Dave_M,White Chocolate Ale (2024),4.34,"I really like this. I can taste all three flavors, but it is mostly coffee forward. The white chocolate and vanilla are very subtle after tastes. Goes down smooth with no bitterness of coffee. (I love straight black coffee, so I'm used to the bitterness!) I also love almost every mixed drink very bitter. But even though this is coffee flavor forward, there is zero bitterness. That may be the effect of the white chocolate and vanilla that smooths it out so well.
Overall, it's delicious.
My wife gave a sour look when she tasted it, and she absolutely loves anything with white chocolate. But she's also getting over bronchitis and admits her taste is off right now. 
I'd probably buy this regularly if it was regularly available!"
1354,zeff80,White Chocolate Ale (2024),3.93,"12oz bottle. Poured out a clear, golden amber color with a small, off-white head of foam. It left sudsy trails of lace. It smelled of chocolate, vanilla and light coffee notes. Sweet chocolate taste with a good dose of vanilla, roasted coffee and some toffee."
1355,whynot44,White Chocolate Ale (2024),4.15,"Somewhat hazy deep golden color with a respectable white head and some bits of lacing. 
The aroma is mild coffee and vanilla. 
The taste is mild coffee, creamy white chocolate and vanilla with a rich golden ale background, very slightly sweet, no real bitterness. Flavors are blended nicely and mostly understated, something rare in most modern ales. 
The body is light/medium, good level of carbonation, creamy smooth, very drinkable, very relaxing. 
Altogether, this is a very nice brew, good for a romantic sharing and a potent but well camouflaged ABV. Aside from that this would also be an excellent desert accompaniment, very nice."
1356,NCAHappyHour,White Chocolate Ale (2024),4.23,Loved it! 12 oz pour from tap at “The Bar” in Olathe Ks. Very low IBUs - crisp and light. Chocolate taste is subtle and has a light coffee flavor. One of most distinctive and enjoyable beers I have had this year!
1357,JodyG,White Chocolate Ale (2024),4.38,"Awesome tasting Ale, alcohol is well hidden and flavor is smooth with notes of roast coffee and vanilla. Not bad aftertaste and carbonation is spot on. Definitely in my top beers and I’ll be drinking more of this"
1358,JM9227,White Chocolate Ale (2024),1.67,"As a Boulevard fan, this almost makes me *angry* it's so awful.

Appearance is deep gold, plenty of lacing, zero carbonation or bubbles apart from the head.
Odor is almost saccharine sweet, dominated by white chocolate and ethyl.
Mouthfeel is just flat. It feels like a 2-liter of coke that you've left open for 2 weeks and grabbed in a drunken failure.
Taste is a weird amalgamation of white chocolate sweetness, a hint of ale, and a bitter coffee aftertaste.

Prior iterations of chocolate ale were able to blend two things effortlessly and effectively. This may have been too ambitious or simply too sweet to work in this context, but I'll go back to drinking Tank 7 or Pale Ale happily."
1359,Sparty1224,Bourbon County Brand Bananas Foster Stout,4.42,"Serving: 1 pt. 0.9 fl. oz. bottle poured into a GI BCBS snifter. Bottled on 8/27/23, making this just shy of 6 months old.

A: Classic BCBS pour here, nothing new. Maybe slightly less carbonation than usual.

S: First obvious note is fresh banana bread. But after that you still get a ton of extra cinnamon, some vanilla, even some dried fruit or cherry. 

T: Unlike the aroma which pops pretty nicely, the flavors here are quite muted. In a blind I might even mistake this for the base. There's slight notes of banana, cinnamon, chocolate. Really no almonds to speak of. None of the dark fruit. 

M: Maybe slightly fuller than some of the bottles I've had so far this year, but still thinner compared to years past. 

O: So 2017 was the first year I missed out on BCBS since I really got into to around 2012 or so. That was the infamous year where the tickets were capped around 8 or 9 pm and a ton of people missed out. It was also the first year of the Reserves, I believe. But the Prop was Bananas Foster. Never had it, but it never sounded too interesting to me. But to finally have it now, I can see why it worked. The jist is chocolate banana bread (which I've had and is very good) and that does work in a BA stout. Unfortunately here, it's super muted. The aroma is decent, but the flavors just don't pop like a variant should. It doesn't need to be fake and cloying and totally in the other direction, but I can barely notice this isn't just Regular. I think the potential for a great redux of that Prop is here, but it was just slightly mis-executed.

Recommendation: Not a bad variant by any means, it's just one of the more subtle and forgettable ones in quite some time. I'd much rather take a variant with flavors I don't much care for but that are actually present and done well. Worth a try if you never had the 2017 version, but not worth the money if you did."

1361,vette2006c5r,Bourbon County Brand Bananas Foster Stout,4.38,"Bourbon County Brand Bananas Foster Stout pours black with a small but long-lasting tan head. The aroma has notes of cinnamon, bread, and hints of banana. The flavor is much the same: lots of cinnamon, break notes, and banana flavors. Good feel. It is tasty, with lots of banana bread flavors and still a good stout foundation."
1362,Oktoberfest,Bourbon County Brand Bananas Foster Stout,4.29,"This is good beer, duh. Maybe not as good as the regulation, non banana, non foster variety. Good though.

But is it good enough to warrant 24 bones for a 16.9 ounce bottle? Some back of the bar napkin math tells me that's ~ $182.00 a gallon. Or said another way, 56X the current US price for a gallon of 87 octane. 

I don't know much about the petroleum industry, but I'm aware oil is a finite resource that's extracted from underground and goes through a refining process before it's transported to my local Stop 'N Rob where I pump roughly $30 worth every couple of weeks and that gets me ~ 500 miles of highway speed.

I'm also aware that no one held a gun to my head at the beer emporium and Bourbon County Stout of any stripe is light years beyond a PBR or Miller Light.

I suppose this isn't so much a review of the beer as it is my own priorities. Wow, did it get deep in here or what? I'm fortunate that I can afford the occasional brew indulgence. Twenty-four bucks though...now THAT'S bananas."
1363,Olesjm,Bourbon County Brand Bananas Foster Stout,4.19,"Pours a deep black with no head. The aroma is dark fruit and chocolate. Flavor has dark fruit, chocolate, cinnamon, almonds, and a little banana hidden in the back. Not a ton or bourbon barrel flavor. Well balance. Full bodied with a slight warming from the alcohol."
1364,zac16125,Bourbon County Brand Bananas Foster Stout,4.3,"A: Jet black, opaque, barely any head and what is there dissipates quickly. 4

S: Aroma is dark fruits, lots of chocolate, some roastiness. Not prominent on the adjuncts. Nice aroma but not particularly strong and not terribly different from base BCBS. 4

T: Taste is fantastic, sweet and roasty notes balance wonderfully. Lots of chocolate. Unlikely the nose the adjuncts are prominent in the taste, yet remain well balanced. Lots of cinnamon, then almond and banana on the back end. Barrel notes are present although not particularly strong, some nice oaky bourbon notes. 4.5

M/D: Full bodied, carbonation appropriate, ABV is exceptionably well masked , drinkability is very good. 4.5

O: Very nice beer. I remember the Prop version of this being more prominent on the banana, which is fairly subtle here. May be a mismemory. Either way, I enjoyed this one quite a bit, probably would fall in the middle or slightly below mid point in terms of all time BCBS variant rankings, but that’s makes it an excellent beer. 4.25"
1365,ZebulonXZogg,Bourbon County Brand Bananas Foster Stout,3.3,"Looks par for the course, smells like bananas, tastes like what i vaguely remember Bananas Foster tasted like on a visit to a Nawlins restaurant."

Flavors of banana, bourbon, cassia bark, roasted malt, chocolate, oak, some almond as it warms. Smooth, a very good fuller body, well carbonated.

The add- ins are all there-the banana when colder, the almond when warmer. Maybe a little too much cinnamon presence, but very nice overall."
1367,LiquidAmber,Zombie Ice,4.25,"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a medium coppery amber with a two finger white head with good retention and light lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, citrus and piney hops, orange and grapefruit. Flavor is caramel malt, piney and citrus hops, orange, pine, grapefruit and a little dankness; solid bitterness in the finish. Medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess. I almost did get this because I was not all that excited by ""ice"" IPAs, but glad I did; it's slightly sweet and malty with fine citrus (as promised) and pine (which was a pleasant surprise) hop character. To be honest, it is reminiscent of old fashioned big IPAs from Stone and Lagunitas here on the West Coast, which is a fine thing in my book. The hops a bit dialed back, as appropriate for the pale ale style, but still flavorful and with good bitterness. I'd get this often if it was in my market. Nicely done. I'll try anything from this brewery."
1368,HOWEverSpence,Zombie Ice,4.52,This is my new go-to beer. Amazing
1369,FRANKHAZE,Zombie Ice,4.03,Citrusy hops balanced by sweet leaning malt flavors. I like it but prefer ZD at its lower abv with a wallop of flavor.

1371,natejpsixx,Zombie Ice,4.17,"This is an amazing beer and right up my alley. I prefer high alcohol content so I think this is way better than Zombie Dust. I went to my local store to buy Hopslam since it's in season and they were out. Disappointed I took a risk and bought Zombie Ice for the first time, I took one drink and was blown away how much I liked it. I bought another 6pack a few days later and a case around Christmas. The first thought that ran thru my mind was it reminded me of a Sierra Nevada Hop Bullet ( which I love ) but better. If there was one thing I'd change is dial back just barely on the citrusy flavor and replace it with more granola. It has a crisp clean finish that doesn't linger. All in all I love it."
1372,cbuzz24,Zombie Ice,4.27,"Nice and crisp, a little boozy. Not too sweet, not too dry. Not perfect, but it is better than most IPAs out there, though not as good as Zombie Dust."
1373,Oatiez,Zombie Ice,4.62,"Almost perfect. A rouch too sweet, maybe a little too much caramel malt. I personally would like it a touch drier. Amazing showing from the legendary Three Floyd's. Can brewed on 11/10/23 drank on 1/14/24. Slow clap!"

1375,BuxMontBeerLover,Voodoo Ranger Tropic Force,3.83,"Purchased at Pennridge Beverage, Perkasie, PA. 6pk/12 oz. cans.

Pours a hazy, opaque light honey color. A dense, foamy, one-finger head on the initial pour. Foamy lacing left on the side of glass.

Aromas of tropical fruits.

A mixture of pineapple, mango, peach, vanilla on the initial taste. A bit sweet. A bitter, hoppy aftertaste. The ABV is slightly noticeable, maybe slightly medicinal.

Medium consistency, medium to thicker consistency.

Overall, a decent but not outstanding IPA. The latest move for Voodoo Ranger (New Belgium) to go towards these very intense, fruity beers seem to move away from the what I love about the original Voodoo Ranger and the Imperial Voodoo Ranger. Cheers!"
1376,defunksta,Voodoo Ranger Tropic Force,3.53,"Appearance: Pours a completely clear, medium to light golden color with a strong and pillowing white head. SRM of 7. (4.00)

Aroma: Strong aromas of mango, pineapple, fruit punch. Some nectarine and peach tea as well.

Flavor: Strong flavors of nectarine, mango, peach, and fruit punch. Some peach tea and floral notes linger. Juicy.

Feel: Medium-bodied, strong carbonation. Smooth with a juicy like mouthfeel. (3.50)

Overall: First try at this Tropic Force IPA. Not much of a fan of these ""juicy"" IPAs. and by ""juicy"" I mean beer that literally tastes like fruit juice. Drinks similar to their Juice Force IPA, but maybe some more tropical peach and mango flavor. It hides the alcohol well and is drinkable, but the juiciness is offputting and not right in an IPA. There's a lot better New Belgium IPAs out there, and I'm not a fan of these juicy and imperial Force IPAs. (Rating: 3.53)"
1377,tone77,Voodoo Ranger Tropic Force,3.38,"Poured from a 19.2 oz. can. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is very sweet and fruity. Taste is pineapple, sugar, coconut, mild bitterness, alcohol is well hidden. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a mediocre beer."

Look: Medium opacity - just able to see my fingers through the glass. Bright yellow with thick, creamy foam. Sticky lacing all around the glass.

Aroma: Pineapple juice and a pound of sugar are dominant.

Taste: When I was a kid my mom would drink those Sobe juices. (Do they even make those anymore?) This tastes just like the pina colada flavor. Very strong coconut and pineapple notes, lime rind, over a super-sweet malt base. Think Hawaiian sweet rolls. Cloying aftertaste. If you served this to me blindfolded I might think it was a mixed drink.

Feel: Soft and smooth and highly carbonated. Feels like a root beer.

Overall: They weren't kidding when they said tropical. Fruity and sweet, it's not ""beery"" enough for me."

This beer pours a golden hue with a slight haze. It is topped with an inch of beige head that leaves decent lacing.

The smell is a weird combination of artificially sweet pineapple and pine needles. The aromas seem to clash.

Just like with the smell, the flavors seem to clash. It is really sweet upfront followed by a bitter resin flavor. 

Light bodied with a thin mouthfeel

It is not quite as bad as Fruit Force, but it is not good in its own right."
1381,Crazy4hazy,Voodoo Ranger Tropic Force,4.5,"Voodoo Ranger Juice Force 
Color is golden and very hazy. This is a Hazy beer with a fruit forward blend of semi sweet peach, almost carbonated pineapple, semi sweet green grape and wood . The woodiness balances the fruit very well and it would appeal to many Hazy beer drinkers and is a very good brew. I prefer this beer to Voodoo Rangers Tropic Force which is too fruity .It has a clean finish and I highly recommend it."
1382,Darkmagus82,Voodoo Ranger Tropic Force,3.74,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass
Appearance – The beer pours a clear golden straw color with a huge head of white foam. The head has an amazing level of retention, fading very slowly over time and leaving a tons of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – The aroma is massive of a tropical fruit smell with tons of pineapple followed by notes of mango and cocoanut. Along with these smells comes some papaya and a bit of grain as well as some notes of a grapefruit and herbal hop.
Taste – The taste begins lighter in sweetness then I would have anticipated from the nose. That said, it is still rather sweet upfront, with lots of pineapple and grape greeting the tongue, along with some cracker malt and a bit of grain. Other flavors of a light papaya and tangerine are there as well, with them adding just a bit of a backdrop. Hope flavors of grapefruit and herb persist throughout, being moderate in intensity. As the taste advances the sweetness increases a bit, all while some coconut and melon flavors develop. Toward the end of the taste transition, a bit of warming alcohol makes itself known, leaving one with a warm, pineapple fruity, and moderately hopped taste to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is lighter for a 9.5% abv brew with a carbonation level that is higher. Overall, for the warming booze and fruit the feel is good and makes for an easier sipper.
Overall – A little bit boozy tasting and somewhat over the top on pineapple, but not bad. Would at least give it a try."
1383,reptile3141,Voodoo Ranger Tropic Force,1.96,"Unfortunately, this is very similar to Fruit Force. This doesn't taste like an IPA in any way, shape, or form. This tastes EXACTLY like a malt liquor. If I was blind folded, I would swear that I was handed a Four Loko. Avoid, avoid, avoid."

12 oz. can dated 231215 (12/15/23) - 9.5% ABV / ? IBU
Brewed and canned in Fort Collins, CO

Look - Pours a dense and fizzy white head that leaves lacing. Cloudy, light yellow appearance.
Smell - Getting aromas of pineapple, peach, orange citrus, kiwi, guava, mango.
Taste - The hops are more prominent in the taste. Dank, floral, and herbal hop flavors lead into a bitter aftertaste. The hop flavors basically drown out the tropical flavors. Zero alcohol taste.
Feel - Thin to medium bodied with a semi-crisp mouthfeel and finishes dry.
Overall - The strong hop flavors keep this brew from being very tropical, even with natural tropical flavors being added. That being said, it's still decent, and the high ABV is hidden well."

1386,Jugs_McGhee,Rested Reserve,3.4,"BOTTLE:

Up the roasted barley, please - this needs more bitterness to counter the sweetness.

Chocolate covered cherry & pomegranate seed. Zero vanilla or oak. Zero whiskey barrel flavour, inasmuch as I can discern. Dark malts, chocolate malts.

Viscous and thick, but not undrinkable.

Boulevard does better beers of this ilk, but I don't dislike it - I just wonder if it spent enough time in whiskey barrels (I don't see an age statement on the bottle) to actually absorb any of the intended flavour, or, to be more cynical, maybe the whiskey barrel bit is all just marketing nonsense.

I'd expect robust vanilla/vanillin character in a Heaven Hill aged stout, and this barely delivers.

I don't get a lot of brown liquor, in fact if tasted blind, I'd swear there were wine barrels in the mix. There is vinous note towards the finish and I typically appreciate jammy or wine elements in stouts but there is a touch of vinegar here that isn't working for me.

The beer pours a dark coffee brown color almost black and no light is passing through my glass. A dense creamy tan head of about 1 cm foams up and fades to a sturdy surface layer. I get some scattered lacing when I swirl the glass. 
Aroma is dark chocolate, roasted malts, molasses and a good hit of bourbon. Not boozy more of the sweeter notes of bourbon. No hint of hop character anywhere on the nose. 
First sip reveals a medium to thick body with very fine and tingly carbonation. Texture is coating and sticky and covers my palate on each sip. 
Flavor is what the nose advertises with dark chocolate, molasses and brown sugar and a good dose of bourbon coming through. I also get hints of vanilla and general roast character. Never any hop notes on this beer. ABV doesnt come through with any warming on the finish and the bourbon flavor does linger. I enjoy this barrel aged treat. Not overly complex but very good at what it should be for this style and beer. Nice one!"

Medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess. A rich, flavorful barreled stout with clear bourbon notes, but also some unexpected Port or Sherry character of berries and dark dried fruit, interesting notes of licorice and barrel oak. Nice chocolate character in the head, aroma and taste. A bit warming, but ABV well covered by the complex flavor. One of the best Boulevard brews I've had this year. Very nice.

Perfect. I haven't had a New England IPA this good in a long, long time. . .

The flavor is reminiscent of soft, sautéed, golden brown sweet onions upfront. It very softly transitions into tantalizing bitter flavors of citrus that are almost grapefruit gelato or grapefruit sorbet like. Finally it goes bitter with long, protracted flavors of pine needles mingled in between peppery notes of sprouted broccoli and even dare I say - just a hint of ground mustard seed (not the condiment but literally - the seeds of ground mustard flowers). As it warms, develops a sort of pretzel and soda bread type of note.

Feel:
Pillowy. Dense and rich. Soft but still noticeable levels of carbonation. Not flat or tepid.

Overall:
Like I said; your results may vary if you're not drinking it fresh, but within a week of it being canned; this is superb. A rare five's across the board.

I've had both ""Broccoli Rabe"" (a sister beer of this) and ""Broccoli"" 

For those of you who don't know, in Italian cuisine - broccoli rabe is a dish very similar to collard greens that is typically fried in olive oil with garlic, only they are much more vegetal and bitter. They are typically served as an appetizer with fresh bread and antipasta

As far as the beers from Otherhalf go, I'd say ""Broccoli Rabe"" is more bitter, experimental and punchy (which is fitting), but ""Broccoli"" is the more perfect beer. You really; really cant ask for more than this."
1405,ChuckD05,Broccoli,4.77,"Almost perfect NEIPA. Fruity but not over the top, great flavor and feel. Have the fortune of being able to get these in a 4 pack while they are nice and fresh, and I will grab them every time I see them. Cheers."
1406,flagmantho,Broccoli,4.1,"Poured from 16oz can into my BeerAdvocate teku. Canned 12/5/23.

Appearance: kind of a pale golden hue with plenty of haze and a thick finger of frothy ivory foam. Head leaves a nice lace on the glass. Not bad at all.

Smell: sweet, with a hop character that has a nice dankness and a rich, earthy, I don’t know how else to put it, “hop” aroma.

Taste: malt is pretty sweet, with a nice dankness that is almost juicy. Bitterness is very low, but there’s an earthiness and just a little acidity to help counterbalance the sweetness. The flavor profile is interesting, but there’s also something kind of vegetal here that doesn’t quite fill the bill for me.

Mouthfeel: medium body with a good carbonation and a nicely rich mouthfeel indeed.

Overall: a pretty decent hazy, although to be honest, it doesn’t entirely come together for me. So, it’s reasonably good, but not quite “excellent” for me."

1408,JohnniEMc,Broccoli,4.38,"The pour that emptied the contents of a pint can into a clear glass liter mug indicates this is another modern American IPA. Thankfully, it didn't bring the awful foaminess resultant from too much wheat in the wort. Actually, the head is very modest for its style. The brew is apricot-amber, with a yellow tint and it's opaque. Obviously wheat and oat based, at least this didn't pour ridiculously foamy. It smells pretty good, in that muted and muffled way of today's hazies. It's not sweet enough to be juicy, but it's not sharp enough to relate its aroma to anything other than a starched up modern American IPA. At least there's a little sharpness to its taste. The mouthfeel is good, but even better, it's not fluffy. This tastes good. It's one of those few overly starched hazies that actually has a hoppy character, including a bit of a bite at the finish. Negatively, the body provides a nicely smooth medium, but offers no other taste layer. This has full, but muted hoppiness from start to end, with a clean bitter finish. Fine, but there's no tasty counterbalance from the backing starches. That's something barley used to do, until it was seemingly banned by East Coast brewers. Other than that, this is wonderful. The combination of hops provides references to pine, citrus and even some berry notes. There's even stratified glass lacing for the eyes. Since settling with barley-less brews is the new norm, at least on the East Coast, this will do better than most."

1425,Victory_Sabre1973,Postseason IPA,3.27,"From a 12oz bottle, enjoy before March. 

Very clear amber pouring beer. 1 finger white head. Nice looking head with smaller bubbles. The head dissipates somewhat slowly, and produces a slight bit of clingy lacing on the glass. 
The aroma is, well, not sure how to describe it. I know I'm getting hops here, but I'm also getting an off putting aroma here, very off putting. 
Taste doesn't have anything off putting about it. There's a nice hop flavor here, and has a very nice bitterness to it. The hops lean more toward pine for me. I also get a good malty flavor in this beer that provides a bit of balance to the hops. 
The body is lighter, but pretty damn good for such a lower alcohol beer. Bitter feeling does linger a bit. 
The aroma is awful for me, but the flavor makes up for it."
1426,MetalHead7734,Postseason IPA,3.79,"Poured from a bottle into an ipa glass.

Look Dark gold-orange. Moderate head. Ok retention.

Smell: Big punch of dry hops. Some bready malt hiding behind that. Nothing complex but not offputting.


Taste: A dry, hoppy start is quickly overtaken by sweeter malt flavor, then a gradual, dry finish.

Feel: Feels correct for an ipa.

Overall: It's good. I could sip on this every once in a while."
1427,zeff80,Postseason IPA,3.49,"12oz can. Poured out a clear, golden orange color with a small, fizzy white head of foam. It left minimal lacing. It smelled of caramel, toffee and light resin notes. Tasted of toasted caramel, toffee and a sharp bitter bite."

Look: Absolutely gorgeous amber that leans a little towards the yellow side. Thick, foamy head (just how I like it, haha). 
Smell: Appealing. Some Citra hops come through. 
Taste: Like water. Some bitterness. A slightly grainy aftertaste. Expected for an IPA of such low ABV. 
Feel: Medium carbonation that stings the tongue (but not in a good way, more like a nasty, carbonated piss, AAL type of way).
Overall: A beautiful looking beer that sure deceived me. If this beer tasted anywhere near as good as it looked it would have been a classic. Instead, it’s a cheap and under flavored waste of my money. No, I would not recommend."
1429,Davidstan,Postseason IPA,1.25,Drain pour. Taste like a N/A with no malt or barley. This is disgusting and I’m a big fan of Boston Lager. This variety pak is one of the worst on the planet. If not for the Red Zone Lager it would be a total loss. 29 bucks for case at Costco
1430,ChainGangGuy,Postseason IPA,3.77,"Part of the Prime Time Beers variety pack. $15.99 at Kroger in Woodstock, Georgia.

Appearance: Pours a clear, light golden-bronze body with just barely an inch of whitish foam. Modest lacing.

Smell: Biscuity note with a fresh, juicy zip of tangerine, lime and a little guava. Sprinkling of cracked black pepper, garlic.

Taste: Biscuity with a hint of lightly toasted grain and a brush of golden syrup sweetness. Citrusy, floral with a subtler, distant backing of tropical fruit. Lightly bitter though sufficient enough to balance. An earthy, peppery accent joins the fruitiness, along with a little hint of garlic chives. Swings back towards the biscuity start for the lightly peppery, drying finish.

Mouthfeel: Relatively light-bodied. Medium carbonation.

Overall: It'll do."

Appearance: The beer has a light gold body with brilliant clarity. The color is lighter than a typical IPA and trends more towards what lighter SRM American Pale Ales look like. It has a very short head which is creamy in texture and white. It doesn't have much head retention but it leaves nice sheets of lacing on the glass with tiny bubbles.

Aroma: It smells meaty with a bit of bandaid aroma. There are some notes of garlic.

Taste: Garlic and onions come through at first, then there is a bit of pine. Towards the middle of the mouth it has more pine and a bit of grapefruit pith. There is also a grain husk flavor in the center of the palate. Towards the back the meaty character that came through on the nose starts to pick up which makes the beer a bit awkward to drink. It has a freezer burn flavor in the aftertaste.

Mouthfeel: Hop bitterness is medium and it feels good for the beer. The beer itself is light and crisp. Drinkability is hampered a bit by the awkward meaty aroma and flavor. Parts of the drinking experience make the beer feel more or less clean, depending on where it is on the palate and if sips were consecutive or if a palate cleanser was used. It's just awkward overall to drink.

Overall: The hop bitterness and both the pine and grapefruit flavor characteristics were nice. Otherwise the beer was simply awkward to drink with its off-flavors and aromas. It's not a beer I would buy again or recommend."

This beer is clear pouring. Dark amber in color, and looking quite beautiful. The head is not too thick at 1 finger, but the head retention is great. The head color is off white, more red/white. No lacing on the glass. 
Slight aroma. Mostly biscuit/malt here. Not too strong, but not offensive at all. 
Taste - A lot of malts here. There's a bread/biscuit flavor. I get a caramel sweetness. Some roasted flavors. Somewhat sweet, but a slight bitterness on the back. 
Crisp, light, yet clean body.
Interesting beer overall."
1436,MetalHead7734,Samuel Adams Red Zone Lager,3.37,"Poured from a bottle into a pilsner glass.

Look: Brown with a red hue, not unlike what you might see on a cowboy boot. Thin, off-white head.

Smell: Sweet and lightly malty. As I continue to nose the beer the sweetness fades and a light bitterness takes over. I have no real complaints here, I just wish there was a bit more going on.

Taste: An initial surge of hops. There is an off note here that i can't quite put my finger on. Sweet, caramel malt creeps in, then fades away for a lightly bitter, hoppy finish. This beer is more hoppy than I expected it to be. The sweetness and the hoppyness are a bit at odds. The flavors don't come across as super cohesive, but rather disjointed.

Feel: Nice medium body for easy drinking. Not super fizzy, so almost a little watery.

Overall: Fine enough for a one off, I guess."

Overall: I normally enjoy beers with fruit, but I really didn’t like the strawberry taste I got in this one. No I do not recommend this brew."

Not quite to the standard of their bulwark lager, but still pretty good. This lager, however, does have a beautiful look - clear coppery colored brew with a nice head, the smell is solidly familiar just not special.

Taste: Sweetish toffee candy, toasted bread maltiness. Pop of fruitiness hinting of sweet cherry. Splash of sweetened black tea. Presents only a light, fleeting bitterness, so it swings back a bit sweet for the finish.

Appearance: The beer has a mahogany brown body with a tea-like appearance, sporting notes of burnt umber and sunburst orange-gold. It has brilliant clarity. The head is short and creamy textured with an off-white appearance that has some eggshell and tobacco stained yellow tints. It maintains a shorter version of the already short head, and it leaves nice thick sheets of lacing with tiny bubbles.

Aroma: Oddly there isn't much of an aroma in this beer at all. Even when cupping the top of the glass it only barely gave off a yeast character that is similar to some Scottish and Irish ale yeasts. After a while from sitting in the glass it gave off some nail polish remover aroma, possibly ethyl acetate.

Taste: That nail polish remover flavor hits the tongue up front and it lingers on the palate until the beer leaves the tongue. While searching for flavors that weren't dominated by nail polish remover, some nutty flavor came through towards the middle of the palate. There is a bit of walnut in the aftertaste as well.

Mouthfeel: It has a light bitterness from the grain flavor.the mouthfeel is on the upper edge of light. It is pretty smooth which is nice. Drinkability is very low given the flavor and aromas of ethyl acetate.

Overall: It is a disappointing beer and I'm not sure how this passed quality control. The beer looks fantastic in the glass but that is where the enjoyment of this beer stops. I would not drink it again and I would recommend against drinking it."
1446,TuffBunny,Tup,4.23,"The appearance: A nice darker amber. The head disintegrated quickly, making the beer look flat.
Smell: mostly malt, a little honey character. 
Taste: The malt hits right away. I love these very distinctive malts that are more a small production used by a local brewer. It has a toffee character and is nicely balanced by the hops. There's a little sweetness, but the finish is fairly dry. I would never guess that this is an 8% ABV beer.
Nice medium mouth feel. Not too heavy. 
Overall a 4. I enjoy this, primarily for the nice malts which are distinctive. I'd probably like this better if it looked better. You're probably not going to get through more than half a glass before it looks completely flat. I'd probably want to drink more if the ABV was lower.

Notes via stream of consciousness: Whoah! This is 8% ABV! I had no clue. It's a clear deep golden/amber in color beneath an inch or more of creamy white foam. Plenty of bubbles can be seen racing upwards within the glass. In the nose I'm finding grainy and lightly toasty malt but no real hops. There are some herbal and floral notes in the mix but they don't stand out on their own. The alcohol is present but it's not too bad. On to the taste then... as I suspected the malt remains dominant but there are more hops, both floral and gently herbal, but also spicy. The grain is a touch toasty, and lightly sweetish and biscuity. There's a median bitterness, and the alcohol has a clear presence, both of which bring it to a dry and spicy conclusion. Hmmm, I wonder, is the spiciness that I'm finding in the flavor from hops, or just from the alcohol? It doesn't really matter, it helps the beer overall. That is, of course, coming from a guy who likes strong beers and is used to the alcohol. It's not too hot, and there are no off phenolics so it's good, and believe me when I say that I've had my fair share of higher alcohol beers that were nasty and undrinkable. To wrap up, the body is medium and it's nicely crisp. The head held up fairly well straight off but then it collapsed rather quickly making me think that it was the release of carbonation that was keeping it up at first. Once fallen it was just a collar that got thinner and thinner, and there's basically no lacing left behind. I'd still say it's a pretty good looking beer but it's not going to score a lot of points. I've certainly had both better and worse strong lagers but this is not one I'd return to. I see it as what I like to call a 'bahnhof bier', which means train station beer in Deutch, or 'nádražní pivo' in Czech. It's something I'd grab along with some bread, cheese, and beef sticks for a long ride, but not something that I'd keep on hand at home.

1448,BeerAndGasMasks,Tup,3.33,"From the can, it pours a clear golden amber color with an initially nice just off white head that soon diminishes to a nice ring but leaves lacing. The nose gets slight malt scent, with a touch of something unpleasant. The mouth follows with a malty brew that is does not stand out with spectacular flavors."
1449,Beginner2,Tup,3.54,"A micro-history comes first with a brewery new to me. I found an interesting website with a page on Brno's beer scene https://www.manvsglobe.com/craft-beer-brno/. Its lists twenty+ breweries and beer joints in Czechia's second city of 400,000 inhabitants. But Brnovar is not among them.

Brnovar operates under its primary brand name VLTAVAN. It uses this name for its 4.7 ABV lager as its flagship, then TUP at 8% and then Alco Power at a whooping 16%, all bottom-fermented. Its website has an English button; proving they want to cater to tourists and want to expand their market. Near Brno's main train station, VLTAVAN was brewed on this site until 1948 when it was nationalized. I'd like to know the story on how it restarted after the Czech Velvet Revolution.

As for TUP, my bad to open this for lunch. (I drank 4 ounces and that may have been too much ABV mid-day.) TUP Looks an attractive pale pushing towards amber, but needs more foam (if possible at 8 ABV.) Smells are mostly malt. Tastes follow, but it uses hops well to contain the malt for balance. (Don't expect a pils here, 10 IBU if I recall correct.) Medium-mouthed, more bubbles would be nice. I got my copy courtesy of Costco distributing the European Beer Box for importer Webster Barnes."

I am drinking Guinness today using a Wilie Belcher. I served it at 46 degrees. The pour created a creamy, one-fingered, light tan head with above-average retention. The color is dark brown, nearly black, charting around S.R.M. 36. The beer is opaque. The dissipation lacing on the glass. The appearance is above average for this style. 
The initial aromas are dark roasted malts, chocolate, cereal grains, slight char, raisin, and molasses. Simple and delicate nose of dark roasted malts. 
The flavors are raisins, dark roasted malts, coffee, chocolate, char, molasses, and malted chocolate balls.
The mouthfeel is creamy and finishes smooth yet tannic. 
I have consumed this beer in Ireland; it tastes so different here in the States. The beer tastes odd, with lots of malt and sweetness. I thought the beer was going to be drier. I do not care for the widget in the can. The few beers I have consumed on nitro were not worth it."
1455,stevoj,Guinness Draught,3.17,"Bottle from Albertsons. How did i miss this? After being wowed by the export version in the UK, its time to see if this Guinness can hold it's own. Used to be a go-to for me. Near black pour, thin cap of beige head, not as substantial as I remember. Aroma is sweet and roasty. Taste also comes in sweet, too sweet. Small bitter bite is nothing like it should be. What happened here? This is a poor excuse for a stout, while their export version is superb."
1456,AleManDan,Dank Little Thing,3.86,"I've got to rate this beer! Why? Because, well, Hazy Little Thing is my ""Go To"" beer. 

Why is it my go to? Well, because it's ubiquitous, it's literally everywhere: at my local 7-11, grocery store...shoot, it's even at the little country store in Yosemite National Park! This one was procured in a 12 oz can, part of a sixer from Stater Bros grocery store here in Wildomar, California (not far from San Diego for those outside of CA, and close to Temecula/Murrieta).

So, dank + hazy? Why not? The beer is good. Looks great in the glass, all opaque and murky. 

Smells good: hops, grassy and dank coming through per the name.

Tastes the same: hoppy goodness with stonefruits like grapefruit, but lots of dank, piney, resinous scents.

Mouthfeel is above average, very good....medium and somewhat chewy, but ends pretty dry which begs another sip.

Solid, just like the rest of their Little Hazy series. Solid in terms quality and flavor and when it comes to value/price, it's an A+!"
1457,daliandragon,Dank Little Thing,3.65,"So, this is as promised in the flavor department. The grapefruit and herbal and resin notes are all on point. I also detect some pepper and citrus, but the mélange is a bit less than the sum of the parts. A bit of something not awesome in the aftertaste (kind of like soap), and a mediocre texture kind of doom this to ""fine but nothing special"" status at best."
1458,Stignacious,Dank Little Thing,1.91,"I'm still upset about Dankful going away, so this review is at least partially a projection of that frustration. However, this is the worst Sierra Nevada beer I've had. I do get notes of grapefruit and piney dankness, but the overwhelming flavor on my palate is a sugary Moscow Mule blended with hop extract. I won't be buying this again."
1459,rodbeermunch,Dank Little Thing,3.89,"I didn't even know this beer existed then I came across it at Winco. Easy decision to party. 

Pours a cloudy golden yellow honey colored liquid. In terms of hazy viscosity, this leans light. 1/4"" white head. Aroma has a distinct CTZ like weed smell to it. Nice. A little hit of Amarillo and Chinook giving some grapefruit rind aspirin bitterness to keep it Sierra Nevada up here. 

The taste was leaning to the lusher hop side than the bittering hop side, although they both exist in relative parity to each other, which is a nice hallmark of a good ipa in terms of taste and mouth feel. At 7.5% the mouth feel is easy to drink considering this straddles the line for being imperial or double. I don't really know what the dankness is other than probably a better branding/marketing word than ""marijuana"" for such a big company. There's nothing from the beer nerd world like down under hops in here that we often familiarize with the ""dank"" descriptor. 

Money don't matter tonight, but if you want a pretty good and very affordable beer, well, it does."

A: Pours hazy golden amber with a frothy eggshell white head that settles to a firm layer and laces nicely. 

S: Herbal, resinous, green, citrus zest, pine, peppery spice, hints of tropical stone fruit, biscuity malt, and a touch of caramel sweetness.

M: Medium body, moderate carbonation, soft on the palate. 

O: Sierra Nevada is usually pretty spot on at hitting their target flavor profile, but I think this one is a rare miss. It's piney, herbal, spicy, and citrusy, but not especially dank, at least by my definition. That eucalyptus and mint thing is really throwing me. It's not necessarily bad or undrinkable, just odd. I'd love to see them continue to workshop this one, change up the hops and the way they're added, and bring back a more on point version 2.0."

Amarillo, Chinook, CTZ, Mosaic

TL;DR - Lovely beer, but is it dank?
I have a little theory that there are actually 4 kinds of dank: pine forest floor or musty (Columbus, Chinook), ganga or resin (Strata, Apollo), rotting tropical or onion (Galaxy, Mosaic) and catty or pungently oily (Nelson Sauvin, Vic Secret). And there’s a shedload of crossover - Simcoe, at times, can be all four. 
So does this deliver the titular dank? Kinda. 
There’s evergreen; how could there not be in a SN beer? And there’s a appealing rank citrus rind thing happening, but it’s balanced if not outright negated by an equally citrussy blast of zesty oil that I’d attribute to Amarillo. Chinook comes in late with vague kronik (see the bit about crossover) base notes. 
Mosaic is the hop that’s not pulling its weight here, if I had to guess (and I do have to guess - it’s a fool’s errand to try to deconstruct a hop bill like this.) It’s only dropping in honeydew melon balls when it should be bringing scallions and gym locker room. 
Light body (this 100% Munich buzz that SN is on is working for me), clean, no hint of 7.5% - all the usual hallmarks are there of Sierra R&D and production both. 
And if this is a gateway dank beer - totally possible with Sierra - then it fits the bill. But it's just too spritzy, summery, too *fun* for anyone coming in as a fan of the big dank. 

Does what it says on the tin - just. 

p.s. Roll the can."
1463,Burrocreek,Dank Little Thing,3.99,"This beer is trying to be a lot of things, and as a result doesn’t quite work (although it is well made). Nose is white grapefruit and lemon with weedy overtones. Mouthfeel is substantial with some heat from the alcohol being a tad overdone in my opinion. Lemony, carbonated and piney (think pinesol) flavors predominate with a biscuity sweetness. Dank for sure but I’d rather reach for a true west coast IPA given the choice."
1464,zeff80,Dank Little Thing,3.93,"12oz can. Poured out a clear, golden yellow color with a small, off-white head of foam. It left sudsy lacing on the glass. It smelled of dank hoppiness, orange and sweet caramel. Sharp, piney bitterness with caramel and a fruity kick."
1465,FRANKHAZE,Dank Little Thing,2.82,"Weak mouthfeel, nice grapefruit pithy flavor along with piney resinous notes. Weak structure. Feels like a mass produced hazy. Was able to find this ""limited"" release at Walmart of all places. Sierra Nevada's simpler, cleaner beers are so much more satisfying than this one."
1466,oggg,Dank Little Thing,4.65,"Very much a hybrid of west coast IPA and hazy. Huge aroma of Christmas tree and resin when I open the can. Definitely hazy with great foam. Citrus takes a back seat to pine tree. Big mouthfeel and resiny bitter finish that lingers. 

I love how this beer is so reminiscent of SNPA. But way more fizz, mouthfeel, brightness. Significant bitterness so this wouldn’t suit someone who is hop naive."

PALATE: lighter body and highly carbonated, it's smooth but the crackle of carbonation on the entry really works for me.

OVERALL: this is an excellent BBA, this is the best mouthfeel I have experienced in a beer, it looks nice and the taste was also very good, I would buy this again no problem and would recommend to anyone who enjoys the style."

Feel: Getting into crisp territory. The carbonation provides a wonderful punch. There's a nice, hearty, semi-medium body here.

Overall: This is my first alcoholic beverage back from a dry week and it is a wonderful return. The flavor profile of this beer is right up my alley. It's rare that I really enjoy a beer this much.

It’s not a favorite, but pretty good. There’s also a bit of a candied aftertaste."

1487,Fenix2009,Leffe Blonde,3.81,"I think Leffe Blonde deserves better reviews than it gets. Locally, in bottle, it is a go to Blonde. Nothing bad, hitting all the notes, but perceived as ordinary. However, I am giving this beer a bump up because last year I had a draught pint in an English pub outside London. It followed a pint of English ale, so maybe the comparison favored Leffe, but that Leffe Blonde was remarkable. Smooth and rich, the only time I ever had it on tap, but that pint helped make my visit to Hitchin memorable."
1488,Hephaistos,Leffe Blonde,3.65,"The kind of bench-mark Belgian Blonde. Abbey beer (the trapist style.) Produced with barley, malt of barley, mais (corn), yeast and added sugar, I think they changed the recipe a bit during the years.
It used to be a bit more lighter and creamy.
Can of 330ml, chiled at around 7 degrees celcius, poured in a leffe chalice,
Highly carbonated, small bulbs, 2 finger white head, pretty amber colour.
Smell, sweet, bit biscuity, with a little spicy scent, myrrh maybe.
Taste, more bready, full, balanced, hints of honey and stronger precense of some spice.

Pretty well made beer, highly available here, but no my favorite blonde."
1489,toby_wuz_ere,Leffe Blonde,3.32,"Leffe is an interesting beast - have it bottled with your friends and it can be a very quick way to render yourself inebriated (and strapped for cash). However, ask for it on draught from your local - let's be honest - Wetherspoons, it can quickly overwhelm your ongoing buzz. The spirit of Anheuser-Busch begins to rear its ugly head such that your pint of Leffe suddenly begins to roil your stomach. My local only serves Leffe in half-pints and I had to throw back my second half before closing time. It was a challenge. Overall, truly one to savour. You must be in the mood for Leffe. It can all too easily become an expensive mistake.

S: It starts with nutty, oaky, rich bourbon aromas. There are prominent dark fruit notes and some leather. Not nearly the roast forward nature of most BCBSs and in general the base beer characters take a back seat to the barrel. 4.25

T: Taste is rich and complex. Roasty and herbaceous up front, huge dark
chocolate on the back end and lingering in the finish. Theres a big nutty character, peanuts specifically which I almost never get in BCBS or its variants. There is somewhat of a vibrant fruit character that is difficult to place but adds some welcomed balance. Unlike the nose there are tons of roasty characters. Of course, the barrel is prominent contributing to many of those above noted characters. Lastly, there’s a bit of fusel booziness but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. 4.5

M/D: Full bodied with lower but acceptable carbonation, ABV is well masked, drinkability is just ok. 4.25

O: Overall this is a tasty beer but doesn’t live up to the pedigree of the BCBS Reserve series. I have one more which I will let rest until it’s around 2 years old (the typical peak BCBS drinking age, IMO) and then revisit. But as is, it’s no higher than middle tier BCBS variant and probably the least impressive Reserve to date. In terms of this years variants, this really feel short compared to this years cask finish variant.

The Eagle Rare is ripping – you can take one sip & tell this is quality bourbon poured over a quality stout. Lucky me. Very sweet, mild chocolate, leather, with a finish of quiet char & caramel. Trademark BCS mouthfeel (big) & booziness (big). Taking this bad boi down over a couple hours of watching canoe videos. Geekiness, may I count the ways.

1495,ThisWangsChung,Fort Point Pale Ale,4.07,"Pours a murky - if not quite turbid - golden color. There's a finger worth of white colored head; retention is decent. Though not groundbreaking in 2024, the nose hits all the right notes for a good hazy pale ale - grapefruit, tangerine, apricot, mango, papaya, and maybe the slightest wisp of blueberry. Malt presence is low. The flavor profile works about the same. It opens up with plenty of tropical fruit flavors (mango, papaya, dragon fruit maybe?), with a kiss of malt sweetness to finish it off. I have to say, it's not the boldest pale ale, not by any means. It is, however, beautifully balanced and refined; this alone helps it stand out from its more brutish peers. Where this offering absolutely shines, though, is the mouthfeel. The mineraly, slightly firm (but not angular) feel is not only deceptively delicate, but is also a perfect match to the subtle, nuanced flavor profile. It just smoothly evaporates off of the palate without any hint of harshness, inviting more sips. And even more sips. And then another can. And then, hell, why not, the whole four pack. It doesn't even need high carbonation to accomplish its drinkability factor, though it's definitely there. I see why this basically revolutionized the genre - it takes all the good parts of a hoppy beer while almost entirely removing the less desirable elements. About the worst I can say is that the aroma and taste don't really stand out among other great hazy brews in 2024, but I don't care. Like many of the beer world's greats, it's more than the sum of its parts. Highly recommended."

This one has definitely earned its reputation. It's hard to go wrong when you start with Citra and here the addition of Columbus provides just the right counter balance and depth.

Appearance: Pours a turbid, troubled, dingy orange-gold body with a medium-sized, whitish head.

Smell: A pulpy orange fruitiness set against a lightly sweet-smelling honeyed, blonde caramel element along with toasted wheat and coriander.

Taste: Sweetish start of blonde caramel/honey and toasted wheat with a little graininess. Sweetish orange with a faint bitter citrus hint. Earthy, floral coriander, a dull yeastiness, and a little showing of alcohol give a smidge of a drying sensation, but it still finishes a bit sweet.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium carbonation.

Overall: I am always for one-offing a fine base beer, though, this is one of those times I'd recommend simply sticking to the original Oberon."
1505,Lanoke12,Oberon Eclipse,3.81,"Look is dark amber. Smell is of roasted slight sweet malts. Taste is of slight sweet malts and wheat. Feel is medium bodied. A good variant in the classic Oberon beer, although I liked Winter White Ale Witbier as a seasonal offering."
1506,Tsar_Riga,Oberon Eclipse,3.94,"A - Pours out clear, a dark orange body, with a short white head, some minor lacing.

S - A hit of sour grains, grass and a bit of biscuity malts.

T - Lovely open of honey and floral hops, a middle that introduces some soft minerality over the more fundamental bread notes, and a light acidity and soft bitterness that winds things up nicely.

M - Very brisk carbonation and moderate weight, with a clean dry finish that calls for another drink.

O - I like this version quite a bit more than the original. This is still a friendly, drinkable brew, but with more depth and better flavor."
1507,BloodSoakedAleMug,Oberon Eclipse,3.78,"Look: Burnt shade of orange with a one finger, soapy white head of dense foam. Laces the glass moderately. 

Aroma: Dried orange peel mostly. A touch of caramel and whole wheat bread.

Taste: Definitely more bitter and malty than the original. Upfront dried orange peel and earthy coriander that slowly transition into graham cracker like malty flavors; which linger on for a good while. Has a sort of wheaties cereal or wheat thins thing going on as well. There's a nice cantaloupe flavor lingering way in the background, but only after the beer opens up and gets to room temperature.

Feel: Silky and supple. Mid-heavy body with low-moderate carbonation. Straddles a fine line between being filling and hearty while still maintaining good thirst quenching drinkability.

Overall: Not sure if I prefer this to classic Oberon; but I do like this. The citrus notes are not as ""bright"" as they are in the OG Oberon, this has way more of a bitter dehydrated orange pith flavor with a much more pronounced caramel malt bill."
1508,teromous,Oberon Eclipse,2.56,"This is a review of a bottle. From the back label: ""BESTBY:09JUN24 PRN 4J160L 2151""

Appearance: The beer is a medium-dark shade of bronze with a bit of dark amber near the edges of the glass. It is very hazy but it is easy to see dark shadows through the glass. There are a ton of suspended solids. It has a short fluffy head which is slightly off-white. The head also has a bit of a creamy texture to it, and although it is short it has pretty good retention. It leaves a few sparse lines and blotches of lacing on the glass. The beer is darker than the typical wheat beer but not quite as dark as a Dunkelweizen.

Aroma: It has a light aroma of some yeast and alcohol. There is the slightest hint of apple. A very, very light hint of banana. It is oddly lacking in aroma for a wheat beer.

Taste: There is a bit of spice up front with a touch of clove and a bit of an herbal note like bay leaf. It has a light bit of twiggy character towards the middle with a bit of alcohol. Slightly bitter herb towards the back of the mouth which lingers on the palate with a bit of that alcohol flavor.

Mouthfeel: It has a body which sits just slightly below medium. Carbonation is a touch on the high end which is normal for the style. Bitterness is higher than expected. It drinks a bit odd because of the strange herbal bitterness.

Overall: It seems like it would take a lot of effort for a wheat beer to have an absence of flavor. This beer has a few flavors, which give it this odd mix of cooking herbs and alcohol, but it never tastes like wheat. It seems like an achievement for all the wrong reasons. The label on this states that it has ""notes of bright orange and cozy coriander."" It has neither of these. With the blue label and the image of a moon, it seems like the brewery was trying to go for a craft beer upgrade to Blue Moon. This is not only a downgrade to Blue Moon, but it's a downgrade to the standard Oberon beer that Bell's normally sells. It is very disappointing.

I don't recommend it and I would not buy it again."
1509,elNopalero,Oberon Eclipse,3.99,"Pours darker than I expected, sort of a malty caramel orange. Orange seems to be the theme here, since I get some orange peel on the nose. The sip is curious, sort of an orange bitters lemon lime soda character. Interesting, and distinctly different from the summer seasonal."
1510,Bouleboubier,Oberon Eclipse,3.86,"(12 oz bottle, best by 23MAR24; gifted cold single... poured into a 14 oz shaker pint)

L: foam fizzing away on pour, leaving no collar even by the end... amber liquid, maybe not as cloudy as one would expect, but I suppose it's on point with its namesake inspiration

S: spicing is weak, muddled; floral with enough coriander to identify itself... mostly fruit on the nose, with a vague background of lightly honeyed golden bread crust

T: spices more zippy (up front) on the palate, while a rich, doughy malt slathered in citrus (peel) oils swells midway... aftertaste still buzzing with spice, met with a lingering granola-like grain

F: mildly plush, silky, protein-plump up front, soon sliding away, leaving a relatively ripping spice and alcohol heat

O: didn't read much about this prior to trying it... a few sips in and 'oh!' that's what's different... a pretty run-of-the-mill American witbier, highlighted predominantly by its pungent spicing (2252; total didn't increase after this review)"
1511,NiceTaps,The Beast of Both Worlds,4.09,"12 ounce pour from a tap.

Dull haze neipa appearance with a bit of WCIPA slightly bright golden hue. White cap, 1F, ample sticky lacing.

It came out cold so the aroma needed a few minutes to arrive as a fresh and clean citrus mix. 

Lemon-orange citrus, stone fruit, blueberry, and more.

Quite smooth and medium bodied. Sweetness was neutralized a bit and the ECIPA wasn’t a juicer.

It was fresh and good. Few and far between, though, at 8% abv."
1512,haines710,The Beast of Both Worlds,4.09,"I hadn't picked a beer from this brewer in quite a while, but this new one intrigued me. How can you resist trying this mashup of West Coast IPA and New England IPA. Not sure it accomplishes what it was trying to do, but it is a decent beer - reasonably priced and fresh. The scent is huge citrus, but the taste is a little syrupy for me. I tasted apricot and mango. It is very sweet but crisp finish makes it feel like a West Coast IPA, I guess. Glad I picked up a six pack, but might not get it again."
1513,AdmiralOzone,The Beast of Both Worlds,4.14,"Pours clear honey gold with a thick white head. Generous lacing. Aroma is faint, citrus. Flavor is citrus forward, a bit sweet and just a hint of hop bitterness in the finish. Feel is medium bodied, adequately carbonated. Overall, another super beer from this fine brewery."
1514,milkshakebeersucks,The Beast of Both Worlds,4.15,"Mostly clear amber/gold, off white head, good lacing. Citrus focused aroma with an assist from a bit of orchard fruit. A little pine showing up in the taste but not enough to distract from the citrus. Fruity enough to take the edge off. Shows a balanced approach with the bitterness. Medium-to-full bodied, well carbonated mouthfeel."
1515,Mdog,The Beast of Both Worlds,4.35,"From a 12oz can:

Appearance: Gold, lots of particles, good head.

Smell: Old school sweetened grapefruit.

Taste: A mild hoppy start, mild sweetness, some citrus, maybe a little melon note. Bitterness stays pretty low. Medium bodied.

Overall: A pretty nice DIPA, not completely old school, especially in the bitterness department. Nice citrus and fruit flavors, easy drinking. Another solid DIPA from Lagunitas."
1516,LesDewitt4beer,The Beast of Both Worlds,4.12,"12 oz can pkg date 11/10/23 into a Becher glass.
L: SRM 4-5 Pours deep glowing golden caramel color with a 1/4"" rocky off-white head, VG head retention, lush & steady carbonation bubbles, medium-thick back-glass lacing, has light yeasty sediment in suspension.
S: Citrus, ripe fruits, caramelized malts, hard candy.
T: Citrus, orange marmalade, a hint of white pepper, background wheat, brown sugar, a light yeast note, cotton candy. It is lightly rich overall.
F: Quite brisk, lightly juicy medium-bodied feel with a smooth medium-length finish that is very gently drying.
O: A beautiful beer though & through. Signature Lagunitas brown sugar sweetness and enticing fruit flavors make it quite palpable and succulent. IMHO their best beer release since Heineken took over. It is outstanding."
1517,mfnmbvp,The Beast of Both Worlds,4.25,"12 oz. can, canned 11/22/23. This is already my third six pack of this stuff, So you can assume right away this is good shit.

Bisexual - I mean Bicoastal IPA ----

A: Excellent tawny burnt orange sienna. Fresh soapy white head. Lots of thin streaky lacing. Looks fresh & appealing.
S: Ah yes, smells fresh & creamy. Packed with juicy fruity hops & I don't mean in a garbage (hazy) type of way. 
T: Tons of peach, mango, papaya. Super juicy & nectary without being overly sugary or sweet; has good classical old-school IPA vibes.
F: Super juicy, crisp, smooth, clean. Super light-bodied and easy-drinking, especially for the higher 8.00% abv.

Overall, an excellent freshie from Lagunitas, and a welcome addition to their IPA family.

Lagunitas The Beast Of Both Worlds -----4.25/5"
1518,ovaltine,The Beast of Both Worlds,4.35,"Pours a golden color with just the slightest bit of hop haze underneath a fluffy white head that provides a sudsy cap on the beer as you enjoy it and a nice amount of lacing. The look is definitely in the WCDIPA vein.

The nose, though, is in the NEDIPA camp, with loads of juicy citrus notes, especially ripe oranges, pineapple, and grapefruit, plus a nice berry note. This is so juicy, I’m looking for haze. None to be found.

The taste also leans heavily towards a NEDIPA, with big juicy orange, pineapple, and grapefruit flavors most prominent and a nice bit of berry flavor as well - yet the mouthfeel clearly (IMHO) bounces back to the WCDIPA side of things, with a medium body that is crushingly dry and clean.

That Lagunitas managed to straddle the WCDIPA/NEDIPA line so well doesn’t surprise me, because they’re a world class brewery (again IMHO) that especially knows their way around hoppy beers."
1519,VABA,The Beast of Both Worlds,4.18,"Pours a clear amber color with a nice head and lacing
Aroma has tropical and citrus hints
Taste has tropical and citrus flavors
A medium bodied well carbonated beer
A good IIPA"
1520,StonedTrippin,The Beast of Both Worlds,4,"high time for a new lagunitas ipa, feels like the innovation here has slowed to a crawl. this is really well done, predictably great from one of the kings of hops, great name too! pretty clear, lighter than copper toned but darker than golden with high shine from the tap, average white head, some lace as it drinks down, great carbonation activity the whole drink. a little more of a modern hop complexion than i am used to from them, especially in a double, the bitterness seems restrained, the fruitiness high, and its not as mosaic dependent as a lot of their beers are, although i do get some familiar cattiness as this warms up. i get coconut too, mango and peach, and nice minerality underlying it all. freshness is nice, yeast impact is minimal, alcohol is exceedingly well covered up, and the grain provides little more than balance, a nice contemporary presentation here, and the flavors follow. definite stone fruit to the hops, some grassiness too and the bitterness seems more middle than late, its juicy on the back end to me, papaya, sweet orange, and a little residual sugar carrying the finish a little further. lemon curd and pine resin at the end, just lightly metallic but its not a problem, the grain staying pretty light the whole way. a nice addition to their lineup, should be successful with this one, but its no hop stoopid..."
1521,MeanMotaScootah,The Beast of Both Worlds,4,"A solid 4 on the floor rating for this baby. Purchased as a box of cans - great labeling as usual with the nitas. Aroma is tropical and sweet, pours a nice frothy head but does dissipate rather fast, low carb but good ""mouthfeel"". No alcohol heat, very smooth given the high abv. Overall flavor is fruity, sweet, almost juicy as IPA's go. I'd say it's more West than East cuz there's not much of the East coast malty backbone - at least from my perspective. Not a hop bomb but they do say that on the can so read the label my friends."
1522,drdiesel9483,Very DDDoublegangerrr,4.59,"Look - Bright tannish yellow and hazy with a nice white head
Smell and taste - tropcial mango stone fruit. That smell is lights out good and the taste is a step below
Feel - full body and great mouth coating
Overall - fantastic"
1523,Holderness,Very DDDoublegangerrr,4.03,"Canned a month ago.

L -- Thick, murky, deep orange haze with a finger of off-white head produced with gentle pour. Good retention and great lacing. Looks a bit milkier than most TH offerings
S -- Kumquat, red grapefruit, mango sorbet, yellow peach. Less pungent than anticipated
T -- Leans pretty citrus-forward in the flavors, with a small amount of generic tropical character
F -- Dense, almost teeth coating, but yet still soft. Pretty impressive for something this high gravity
O -- It is a hoppy onslaught, and definitely doesn't noticeably improve upon 'regular' Dddoublegangerrr, but I was pleasantly surprised to find this didn't have that weird, soulless, abrasive liquid hop character that some of Tree House's more recently super heavily hopped offerings have had

81/100"
1524,Jw13,Very DDDoublegangerrr,4.61,"Pours a dirty brown-orange with a good sized light tan head. Smell is fairly mild, of mango and mixed tropical fruit. The somewhat reserved nose doesn't prepare you for the onslaught of flavor: more mango and orange and pith riding on a sturdy malt base. The mouthfeel is dense and coating, just as the can description promises, and the 9.2% abv is practically undetectable."
1525,papposilenus,Very DDDoublegangerrr,4.23,"From a 16oz can, dated 01/04/2024. ‘So is Joe Flaco elite?’ I have no idea what that means but what else is new. Served in a Tree House-branded willi becher pub glass.

Pours a mucky and thick-appearing oxidized mango flesh color with a finger-plus of creamy head. Retention is terrific, leaving a sudsy cap and a tattered blanket of foamy lacing. Looks more like fruit purée than actual fruit purée.

Nose is fairly faint but enticing nonetheless. Sweet cream, fruit and cake. Aroma of some sort of tropical fruit ice cream.

Taste is dense and doughy, not so much sweet and creamy as anticipated but more fruit rindy bitter. Tasting orange juice concentrate and bitter, oily orange peel, lime peels, mango rinds and melon with just a bit of vaporous vanilla more in the sinuses than on the palate. A little more peach jam-like as it warms but still pretty harsh.

Feel is mega-juicy and, despite appearances, no more than medium bodied with ample fine, tingly carbonation. There’s a very slight warmth in the gullet but nothing that would make me suspect anything like the stated 9.2% abv.

Overall, stupidly over hopped, I mean, right? Yes, Dddoublegangerrr is better than Doubleganger but Very Dddoublegangerrr is not an improvement over Dddoublegangerrrr - in my thoroughly jaded opinion."
1526,ovaltine,Very DDDoublegangerrr,4.5,"Pours the ubiquitous very hazy orange color with the fluffy white head that coats the glass with lacing that Tree House beers are noted for. Beautiful hazy. The nose is a tropical fruit basket, with loads of mango, ripe grapefruit, tangerines, and passion fruit. Wow.

The taste is a very delicious blend of all the aforementioned mentioned tropical fruits, with the ripe grapefruit and mango most prominent, plus a nice dollop of sweet oats at the back of the palate to balance the surprising (and welcome) moderate bitterness. 

The mouthfeel is soft and full, again as expected. I had high expectations for this beer, and those expectations were met."
1527,tekstr1der,Very DDDoublegangerrr,4.48,"Been a long time since I've had anything from this series, and wow a fantastic new NETIPA they've developed in this one. 9.2% ABV and undetectable . Dangerous sauce! All the TH hallmarks are here... gorgeous murky pour, ripe fruits galore, barely bitter - just enough."
1528,Scotchboy,Star Light (Trillium Collaboration),4.05,"16oz can recently found in Boise, didn't realize this was a Trillium collab but that does make me even more excited for this one. It pours out more beautiful than even the most attractive NEIPA's I've been enjoying lately, that warm and inviting and perfected golden orange color, full-on haze with a creamy cap of tightly-bubbled slightly off-white head. My nose picked up a prominent lime characteristic as soon as the can was popped, which was moderately present throughout the nose and tasting, but I would say this one leans more into the papaya and even some impressions of honeydew melon, with a malty sweet body. Pretty nice stuff."
1529,ovaltine,Star Light (Trillium Collaboration),4.5,"Pours a very unfiltered mango color with a fluffy white head that provides significant lacing. Gorgeous beer. The nose is equal parts mango, orange juice, pineapple, and papaya, so I’m drooling.

The taste mirrors the nose, with the mango, orange juice, and papaya especially delicious, augmented by a surprisingly dry mouthfeel that is reminiscent of a WCDIPA in this delicious juice bomb.

All of that equals another fantastic hop bomb from Equilibrium, a truly world class brewery, IMHO."
1530,beergoot,Star Light (Trillium Collaboration),4.06,"Murky peach colored body, opaque; thick, creamy, sculpted, white head; sticky webs of foam inside the glass. Fantastic aroma of ripe peach and orange; subliminal biscuit note. Fine flavors; orange smoothie with a twist of sweetness offsetting the citrus bite; lightly doughy malt base flavor; decent overall bitterness. Heavy body; smooth, soft and velvety; great acidic quality balancing out the residual sugar pillowy mouthfeel.

The ABV is nicely hidden with this beer. The delicate sugary sweetness of the grains and the overall fresh citrus-like flavors from the hops balances things nicely.

Pouring temperature: 51 °F; canning info: n/a
Source: Tavour"
1531,JohnniEMc,Star Light (Trillium Collaboration),4.13,"It looks like the typical modern American IPA, except in this case, the stark white foam wasn't overly excessive. As it now sits inside a clear glass liter mug, the full pint was easily poured from a can. The color is dark yellow-amber that is dull and just about murky. Although the foam is loosely knit, it recedes slowly and evenly. It smells like the modern American IPA, bringing juicy notes of grapefruit and mango, with a pleasant hint of alcohol. Unfortunately, the taste and mouthfeel revert to the now too common overly starched and barley malt deprived recent version of an IPA. It keeps some of the fruitiness of its aroma, but there's no citrusy bite. There's no bite at all. While this may be attractive to modern IPA drinkers, it should annoy traditionalists. The oats included certainly soften the bite, provide a little body and hide the alcohol nicely. But some people like an IPA with a little hoppy bite, especially at the finish. Plus, the oats make the mouthfeel a little chalky, until the finish. This is commendable for softening an IPA hop bite and hiding a significant ABV. It even allows a little hoppiness to come through in the aftertaste. Light and irregular is the glass lacing, evidence that the mouthfeel runs a little thinly, despite plenty of oat characteristics. It's good for this age of IPAs, but it isn't really a great IPA."
1532,Jw13,We Live Among Ghosts,4.47,"Looks like a typical Treehouse DIPA - yellow-gold and opaque. Smell is kind of a mix between the beers that used the yeast derived from the Dataset experiments (beers I didn't think too highly of), and Treehouse classic beers, so maybe this ""new yeast blend"" is just that. Taste is mango, orange and mixed citrus, with a good dose of zesty pith. Carbonation is a little stronger than I was expecting, leaving a pleasant tingle on the sides of the tongue after swallowing. 

Overall an excellent beer."
1533,Billolick,We Live Among Ghosts,4.44,"Tall can with dating info on the bottom thats smudged and useless.

The pour here is a full on TH NEDIPA masterpiece...fully hazed, large and long lasting frothy cap and leaving a boatload of all sorts of good looking froth and lacing all over the glass.

Sniff reveals waves of ripe tropical fruit goodness.

On the palate and thru the mouth its more ripe pineapple, mango, light lime, and assorted stone fruit notes. Mighty fine and highly enjoyable...if you are a fan of the style, this one will not disappoint.

Overall I find this to be a world class take on a favored style...fresh and flavorful...the kind of beer that you want to savor every sip."
1534,KomodoDragon,Schaumstoffherz,3.44,"Even a slow pour of this straw colored brew yielded a huge white head. Crystal clear. 

Toasty bread scent, A little bit dry, a little bitter, a little grainy accompany graham cracker maltiness. Decent crisp feel. Not very exciting, but well built and clean. Quite light, and alcohol is quite muted.

Acceptable German pils, albeit fairly straightforward."
1535,BeerAndGasMasks,Schaumstoffherz,3.45,"From the ""Foam Heart"" labeled can with a nice pastoral scene quite unlike much of anything you might find around Mannheim, where the Eichbaum Brewery is located, it pours with a large white head that slowly reduces and does leave lacing. The liquid part of the brew is light yellow. The nose gets light malt with maybe some spice, although the large vibrant head interferes with the scent transfer. The taste is light and easy drinking. 

I was surprised that Eichbaum, which I remember from my youth at my first duty station, came up with a new name and label for their brew and did not include a pils or export. Sigh. Mannheim is also located in the Kurpfalz, which is a traditional region not affiliated with the modern Rheinland-Pfalz, which is across the Rhine river from Mannheim. Honestly, I found the description in the brochure somewhat misleading."
1536,Beginner2,Schaumstoffherz,3.41,"This is more a lunch beer than a German pils (a pils has a more complexed flavor and hops.) 
But Schaumstoffherz is a good lunch beer. I had it last evening when I wanted to wash down some average soup. And I finished the can just now at lunch with a burger and BBQ sauce. Flexible enough for a lunch beer.

Otherwise, I consider Schaumstoffherz average. For Looks, decent foam in the pour but not much sticks around. Aromas are mostly malt with some sweet floral in the back of the nose. Tastes are balanced, but not distinguished; just average. Schaumstoffherz' soft mouth works with the food, but not much palate cleansing.

I give better Overall marks because I do not remember having a regional beer from the Palatinate state. (Mannheim is a mid-sized city mid-way between Frankfurt and Stuttgart.) While Eichbaum's web-site is developed well and shows a well-established beverage maker, I get annoyed when I can't find the English button. Hence average Overall Hugs relative to my generous scale."
1537,Powderhornphil,Bombraxas,4.29,"Was intrigued to see this on the self. After a few weeks of passing by it at my local store, decided to give it a try despite the $25 price tag. Nice stout but not as impressed as the original Abraxas. Cinnamon, Smoky peppers, coffee. All in all very nice."
1538,Phyl21ca,Bombraxas,4.35,Bottle: Poured a pitch black color stout with a medium dark brown foamy head with OK retention and some lacing. Aroma of roasted malt with some rich chocolate notes with some notes of cinnamon/vanilla and slightly spicy chilis. Taste is also a mix of rich collate malt notes with some well balanced cinnamon and vanilla with light spicy chili notes in the aftertaste. Body has a creamy/oily texture with good carbonation with no real discernible alcohol notes. Well balanced mix of flavors.
1539,Historiker,Bombraxas,4.48,"Poured a clear black with around an inch of tan head that dissipated quickly, reducing to a spotty skim coat. Nice lacing. Exactly what you'd expect to see from a collaboration between these two outstanding breweries. 

Aromas of cacao nibs,/dark chocolate, ancho chilis, vanilla, coffee, cinnamon, and alcohol - strength listed in descending order. Big, bold aromas. Slightly sweet. Lots of roasty/toasty scents. Again, what you'd expect, though I was surprised by the smell of alcohol, which is usually well-hidden by both makers. 

Taste is cacao nibs,/dark chocolate, and roasty flavors up front, followed by ancho chilis, vanilla, cinnamon, and booze, and coffee is hiding in the background. The chilis provide really nice flavor and no heat. I don't love that the alcohol flavor is so prominent, but the rest of the flavors are outstanding.

I'm a little bummed that the mouthfeel isn't fuller. This is a heavy medium, but it needs to be thicker. Smooth, but slightly oily, which, meh...fine. Very little carbonation. Slightly dry finish. 

Overall, a very enjoyable and creative imperial stout..Great blend of cacao nibs,/dark chocolate, ancho chilis, vanilla, coffee, and cinnamon. Somewhat disappointed by the boozy flavor, which Perennial and Prairie are usually better at hiding. I feel like $27 was a little steep for this, but only by a little."
1540,clayrock81,Bombraxas,4.08,"Poured a black body with one-finger khaki head that quickly died. Aroma is strong with dominant notes of coffee and chiles along with some wood and booze. Somehow the beer is silky smooth and not thick or sticky despite starting out like milk chocolate and then quickly becoming a ""chili"" beer, and I state this b/c the chiles and spiciness (cinnamon, pepper) start to overpower the other aspects (your cocoa and coffee which are perceptible but overpowered, and the vanilla which I don't really get much of). Beer finishes dry and with some heat, so while there is good balance I find the stronger notes are a little too strong to me, and this is a definite slow sipper that I can at least say gains a little sweetness as it warms and is worth sipping on during a cold night."
1541,JLK7299,Bombraxas,4.37,"A little too heavy on the cinnamon for my personal tastes. With that said, pours black with a nice head. Little to no smell. Wish it was a little thicker mouthfeel but all nitpicks….a very good beer."
1542,pathman,Bombraxas,4.5,12/30/23 bottle @ home
1543,dbrauneis,Bombraxas,4.41,"A: Pours an opaque yet still clear jet black in color with moderate amounts of fine active visible carbonation rising along the edges of the glass and faint dark cola brown + dark chestnut brown + dark golden yellow + garnet red highlights. The beer has a two finger tall dense creamy foamy tan head that reduces to a large patch of very thin film covering approximately 60% of the surface of the beer and a thin ring at the edges of the glass. Light amounts of lacing are observed.

S: Moderate to strong aromas of coffee + cacao nibs + cinnamon + ancho chili over the top of moderate aromas of vanilla. There are moderate aromas of roasted + toasted + chocolate + dark + caramel malts with moderate amounts of lactose + caramel sweetness.

T: Upfront there are slightly stronger than moderate flavors of roasted + toasted + chocolate + dark + caramel malts with moderate amounts of lactose + caramel sweetness. That is followed by moderate flavors of vanilla + coffee. Finally there are moderate to strong flavors of cacao nibs + ancho chili + cinnamon and a hint of earthy hops. Moderate amounts of roasty bitterness along with a light to moderate amount of ancho chili spiciness both of which linger through the finish.

M: Full bodied with light to moderate amounts of carbonation. Smooth and creamy upfront, slightly slick/oily mid-body and finishes with a light to moderate amount of dryness.

O: Easy to drink with well hidden alcohol and a very pleasant complex creamy, slick, and dry mouthfeel. Very enjoyable with an excellent use of cinnamon, coffee, vanilla, chocolate, and chilis over a wonderful imperial stout."
1544,NCSapiens,Bombraxas,4.19,Really nice mix of Abraxas and Bomb.
1545,Luscious_Malfoy,Bombraxas,4.44,"poured from a 750mL bottle into a perennial snifter. pours thick and black with a quick-to-fade mocha brown foam cap. it’s been years since i’ve had bomb (really should revisit) but this definitely seems more ‘bomb’ on the nose. less cinnamon for sure than abraxas more pepper and vanilla forward whereas abraxas hits harder with the cinnamon and chocolate. same on the taste. definitely more bomb than abraxas. mouthfeel seems more perennial’s style, which prairie’s is legit but this sits on the tongue a touch heavier and finishes heavier. really good mash-up / variant here."
1546,CHickman,Beach Party,3.93,"Had it on tap and it pours very hazy gold color with a 1 finger thick head that faded slowly and left decent lacing. The aroma was mild with citrus notes like tangerine and grapefruit, as well a mild bread like biscuit. Taste was also mostly citrusy, with tangerine, orange peel, grapefruit, sweet malt/caramel and mild peppery spices. I liked the name and had no idea it was a low ABV session beer until I ordered my second pint, but it was pretty good overall for a 3.4% ABV IPA meant for pounding."
1547,izraelc,Beach Party,4,Pours a clear gold. Thin foam. Hoppy aroma. Juicy fruit body. Light bready finish. Slight bitterness. This is deceptively complex for a light beer. Really good flavor. Pleasantly surprised.
1548,322wingedfoot,Beach Party,3.77,"From a can dated 01/02/24. From the label: “This refreshing IPA is packed with lemony citrus, orange, and tropical hop flavors. It’s a full-flavored brew that’ll take you to the beach and back in each sip.“ Pours a nearly clear straw gold color. Nose and palate as advertised with a pleasant bitterness. For a low AVB, non-hazy IPA, this is refreshing."
1549,bobv,Beach Party,4.07,"16 ounce can packaged 05/11/23.

Moderate to vigorous pour yields a nearly one inch white head over a nice and bright body with some lacing.

Nose of slight citrus with even slighter tropical fruit and a hint of pine.

Flavor is light citrus with a tiny malt sweetness in the middle to a finish of slight pine bitterness.

Very nice near full feel with more than medium carbonation.

Overall, a low alcohol beer with way more flavor than expected for a 3.4%er.
Find it and crush it!!
Cheers!!!"
1550,mooseheadchris,Pale Ale,4.55,"Perfectly hopped, bright, and endlessly drinkable. A gold standard."
1551,LanceBiggums,Pale Ale,4.47,"Light amber or dark honey colour. Huge aroma, with bready and caramel malt, rather English in character, and piney, earthy, and spicy hops. The taste follows exactly, with some extra citrus elements. There is a good amount of bitterness from the American hops, but it's well balanced by a stiff-upper-lip English style malty backbone. Goes down a treat as well, perfect amount of carbonation, solidly medium mouthfeel. Overall an excellent beer, the best American ale I've ever had, and well deserving of its reputation."
1552,Pomcq,Pale Ale,4.86,"Deserves a higher rating here—never came across a beer produced on as widely a scale, as available, as consistently delicious and as drinkable as this. It’s the go to!"
1553,dano213,Pale Ale,4.23,"12oz bottle purchased from the fridge as a single for $2.49. PKGD 09/12/23, so this beer is just over two months old.

Look: It has a very nice copper color. Essentially clear but there is a slight haze. There is a steady stream of tiny bubbles rising up the glass. There was a frothy, eggshell-colored head of about two fingers that eventually reduced to a thinner layer.

Smell: It has the trademark Cascade hop nose that Sierra Nevada has become known for. Lots of citrus notes, pine, some floral and honey notes, and earthy goodness. It has a bit of caramel malt character also. The nose is also a bit peppery. More specific notes of orange peel, pine tar, and resin. The aromas are so nice, this could be a nice perfume or cologne.

Taste: Ah, so refreshing and so tasty. It is very flavorful and also very easy to drink. The flavors on the palate very much mimic the nose. It's the prototypical West Coast Pale Ale: it's a hop-driven American Pale Ale that also has a substantive malty backbone with nice caramelly, biscuity flavors. It has a very nice orange peel flavor that is not overly bitter or sweet. There's a more subtle grapefruit pith and lemon peel character. The finish is moderately to highly bitter.

Feel: It's light to medium-bodied. Nicely carbonated; it has a slightly soft mouthfeel. It's very drinkable. Super clean and very crisp, especially for an APA.

Overall: This is an excellent beer. I can't believe that it took me so long to review this. I think that part of the problem and my only criticism of this beer is that I find it very hard to obtain fresh. I'm not sure why that is since SN has such good distribution (especially with the NC facility) and this is their flagship beer. I think that what sets this beer apart from most other American Pale Ales is its more bitter, drier finish. I think that it really adds to its refreshing-ness.

1554,Deaconmark,Pale Ale,4.76,"I will try to be unbiased but been drinking this beer for 35 years. Have to give it the real scrutiny in the taste test. From a can date 05/23/23 so getting up in age but ok. The pour is nice a dense small head off white for sure. It is not a clear beer as such color yellow darker than straw for sure. The nose on this is fruit and sweet it stands out given my recent ratings on beers. The feel is malt and hops at once. It has a bit of a bite at first for sure. The on-tap version is softer going into the mouth and feel. This is creamy and medium body but full compared to some straight up pale ales. It finishes wonderfully creamy, and the glass has nice lace. One can find better beer for a particular situation and occasion but not overall better. Many others offer of this style of American West Coast PA but frankly this is where it starts. You cannot go wrong."
1555,Brewsta,90 Minute IPA,4.24,"Poured slightly dark orange with a off white head from a 12 oz bottle. Hazy to clear with the foamy head disapating to lace. Aromas are strongly floral with sweet malt. The flavors are heavy hop with malty sweetness. Aftertaste is drying and spicy, with warming alcohol. Very good"
1556,ivanbrew,90 Minute IPA,3.8,I thought the beer was way to sweet for an imperial ipa
1557,DistrictElite,90 Minute IPA,4.17,"It’s not the best in the world, but it’s darn good and lives up to its ranking."
1558,jbolger,90 Minute IPA,4.21,It’s not the best IPA in America but it is very good. Nice malty backbone but I do get the 9% ABV. Would pick up again but it has a lot of competition.
1559,RedStickPhil,90 Minute IPA,4.13,"Really good, but world class is a stretch. Looks great with a nice color, ok head, nice lacing. Unremarkable nose. The best feature is a taste that combines maltiness without sugariness with hoppiness without bitterness, all of which pleasantly lingers on the palate."
1560,BigWheelz,90 Minute IPA,4.54,"I generally favor the very malty, hazy NEIPA's. This beer pours a clear dark amber. It has a smooth mouth feel and a very well balanced flavor that hits a perfect balance between sweet and hoppy. Every other beer I've had with an abv this high has a powerful alcohol taste - but not this beer. It goes down very smoothly and puts you in an awesome mood. I'm pretty sure that if everyone in the world simulateously drank a 16oz'r of this beer, we would achieve world peace."
1561,TreeTopCasino,90 Minute IPA,4.75,Lives up to the hype.
1562,BrandonDuguay,Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR),3,"Brewed by Stroh here in Guelph, Ontario, Canada - it's a good, cheap AAL($27.50 - Nova Scotia). I'd compare it to Canadian-brewed Labatt Blue. The worst part is honestly the smell; metallic, stale corn flakes. If you can get past the smell then you're good! it's beer regardless!"
1563,Hunterdietz,Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR),3.64,PBR is a great choice for a cheap beer that delivers on solid lager flavor. Not too much to write home about but a very underrated pick for a beer you can find just about anywhere.
1564,scottishdrinker,Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR),2,"golden yellow/straw in colour. slight musty smell upon opening. lots of streaming bubbles and nice off white head,

slightly sweet/faint corn taste. smooth, crisp, refreshing. good for a cheap lager. one thing of note i see where texas is given as pol. on the side of the can it still says milwaukee, wisconsin that is quite a mystery. i would go with the 12-pack cans as it is cheaper that way."
1565,Col,Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR),4.02,"A - 12 oz can aggressively poured into 16 oz pint glass with 1 finger head that dissipated quickly. Moderate carbonation with bubbles at bottom of glass and some racing to the top. Golden clear appearance, similar to most other AALs. Lacing is left on glass after each swig. 

S - Lager notes of bread and barley malt with hop notes. 

T - A well balanced AAL with bready barley malt notes up front, corn flake note in background. Taste of european noble hops that is much more than any other American beers or Pabst subsidiaries. Very satisfying in regard to flavor balance. It tastes very different compared to Bud, Miller or Coors maybe from the hops or each different yeast cultures. 

M - Tasty light and refreshing, a good session lager that works on a hot summer bbq or winter holiday party. Very balanced in regard to being flavorful and also light and refreshing. Not too heavy, cloying. 

O - What would the world be without PBR? Almost the oldest beer in the US besides Yuengling, IMO it's the premier AAL even compared to it's other cooperate owned peers."
1566,Saluki,Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR),2.64,"Can't get past the inexpensive beer taste (it has no flavors), the mouth feel, the Mean Joe Green stickers and memories of headaches. Maybe the headaches were due to quantities drank versus quality, but I think there is a correlation there somewhere. Would drink a super super cold one with oysters, but as a before dinner cocktail, no gras."
1567,Markarp,Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR),3.5,"Go to beer on summer day. Sweet at first and at least has some flavor, which of course can't be said for light beers in general."
1568,Cdriver0414,Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR),3.1,"A classic that is a step up from other mass produced beers. It's light, crisp, and refreshing. It won't win any awards but it's cheap and easily findable. A good choice if you need a break from $20 4 packs."

1570,Gummybear,Hoist Point,4.08,"This beer is good; citrusy and hoppy but balanced. Not sweet, light carbonation and a slight bitter and pithy citrus lingering finish."
1571,TreyIsWilson,Hoist Point,4.05,"A - Pours a hazy orange with a two finger sturdy white head. Heavy soapy lacing.

S - Aroma is candied orange, mango, pineapple and dank hops.

T - The taste is candied orange, mango, lemon, grapefruit and an assertive piney hop bite.

M - Medium body with medium carbonation. Creamy mouthfeel with a soft dry finish.

O - Decent."
1572,smackdanie,Hoist Point,2.79,"Pours dark orange, totally opaque, no head but good lacing. Very light carbonation, no real mouth feel and a strong cat pee flavor, I'm not a fan."
1573,jzlyo,Hoist Point,3.75,"Aroma is fruit/citrus and Nectaron/nutty hops. The flavor is fruit/fruit rind, malts, a hint of vanilla and a bitter citrus/Nectaron/nutty hop finish."
1574,smackdanie,Dense Light,3.67,"Pours pale gold, no real head. Straight cat pee nose, flavor is pretty good, very light.. as it warms the flavor gets more bitter and the boozybess comes up."
1575,jzlyo,Dense Light,3.98,"Aroma is citrus/fruit/tropical fruit and grains/malts. The flavor is fruit, malts, a small hint of vanilla and a slight sugar/candy/spicy hop finish."
1576,REVZEB,Bourbon County Brand Angel’s Envy 2-Year Cask Finish Stout,4.14,"So far this year's bcbs variants have been disappointing, and unfortunately this does not reverse that trend. The trademark black pour with brown head still good as always. And in the nose the port is a fun wrinkle, bringing out raisin and caramel a bit more, and oak is a touch more obvious. Taste thouh has the pronounced port covering up the usual vanillins and barrel complexity, molasses and caramel are lighter though the later creeps in near the end. Much drier and almost msuty on the finish, otherwise a warm malty body. This is a fine stout, but I would much rather have the orignal bcbs. A year in the cellar might have done wonders for this I will admit"
1577,keithmurray,Bourbon County Brand Angel’s Envy 2-Year Cask Finish Stout,4.35,"I had this at a bottle share back around Thxgvg time and I JUST HAD to get a bottle for myself to properly review

Appearance - dark brown body with crimson hints, tan head

Smell - port, oak, cherry, 

Taste - dark chocolate, port, cherry, oak - the barrel notes are prominent, yet the beer drinks smooth

Mouthfeel - full, thick, rich, viscous, lower level of carbonation, stout qualities upfront with the chocolate, followed by the port/cherry characteristics, flavors are long and bold in the finish, no alcohol burn despite the ABV

Overall - Very good variant of the BCBS stout family. The flavors are very big and bold and long lasting. I never buy the BCBS variants as I find the price points to be cost prohibitive for my budget, BUT I made an exception for this one, that's how impressed I was by this beer. Very smooth. Barrel aged stout lovers owe it to themselves to try this one if their budget allows them to do so. Worthy.

Price Point - $39.99/16.9 oz bottle"
1578,robwired,Bourbon County Brand Angel’s Envy 2-Year Cask Finish Stout,4.54,"I let this pour warm to near-room temperature.
A head didn't foam when poured into a snifter except for a beige swirl.
It has a stout nose with a port scent.
The flavor has notes of ruby port chased by a warming bourbon heat. There's a muted cherry sweetness followed by spice cocoa. And embers.
The mouthfeel is medium creamy with a warm finish."
1579,vette2006c5r,Bourbon County Brand Angel’s Envy 2-Year Cask Finish Stout,4.54,"Bourbon County Brand Angel’s Envy 2-Year Cask Finish Stout pours black with a very small, lacing head. The aroma is big and bold, sweet bourn and port wine. The flavor is the same: big, bold bourbon notes and very smooth hints of the port wine. Good feel. It's a sweeter barrel-aged stout on top of a fantastic angel-envy bourbon."
1580,Luscious_Malfoy,Bourbon County Brand Angel’s Envy 2-Year Cask Finish Stout,4.54,"poured from the standard bourbon county 500mL bottle. pours thick and shiny black with less than a finger of mocha brown foam that quickly fades away. tons of chocolate on the nose as well as light cherry and not quite bourbon barrels but more of an unidentifiable spirit barrel aromas as well. this was poured damn near room temp but as it reaches room temp i get some light peat and leather in addition to the aforementioned aromas. taste follows with bittersweet chocolate up front, dried dark cherries and bourbon and port on the finish. it’s silky smooth but not crazy thick by any means. really good. quite complex. i’m sure it would age fine but it drinks wonderfully right now."
1581,DoctorZombies,Bourbon County Brand Angel’s Envy 2-Year Cask Finish Stout,4.2,"Fast fizzy dark tan head disappeared immediately leaving no cap retention, no island, no ring nor lace; no legs on swirl; black with ruby edges. Port wine nose with bourbon in background; dark fruit and oak; boozy exhale. Red wine entry; bourbon, oak, dark chocolate; some caramel and more dark chocolate as beer warms; dark fruit almost jammy raspberry/cherry finish. Medium light body, almost silky smooth feel; not adjuncty; light carbonation; full mouth warmth (15.5% abv) with bite on tip of tongue; tannic; dry wooden barrel finish. Overall, there are layers of base and barrel flavors, but the red wine flavors (while nice) overpower the whole; thin for abv (dangerous) and easy drinking."
1582,jzeilinger,Double Barrel V.S.O.D.,4.18,"Many thx to The_Kriek_Freak for sharing this.

A - Pitch black pour with no lacing and looks like oil.

S - Cocoa, vanilla, and some alcohol (but not much).

T - Toasted cocoa, alcohol, light vanilla, and Bourbon with a small amount of spice.

M - Light syrupy, leaves a sugary residue on the lips, and warming in the back of the throat.

O - ABV forward but sure dued for 17%. (If that makes sense.)"
1583,Sabtos,Double Barrel V.S.O.D.,4.61,"8 ball black with a dark tan to burnt brown head that builds quickly but short and fizzly.

The nose immediately explodes with a dark chocolate Tootsie Roll and port pairing, even leaning into a little merlot grape.

Taste is a little spikier but still full of chocolate threads, dark grapes, even blackberries, all amidst charred walnut and vanilla dosed caramel.

Sweet but more balanced than DBVSOJ, a fine but soft carbonation comes to a faintly sticky finish, exhaling spiced date and chocolate chips."
1584,SpeedwayJim,Double Barrel V.S.O.D.,4.51,"12oz. Can into a Side Project snifter. 

Pours pitch black. Viscous, oily, rich. Huge legs. No head or lace. Nearly flat. Nose is molasses, sweet soy sauce, barrel, and dried dark fruit. Aromatic. Boozy. Beer opens chocolate, molasses, and dried dark fruit. Booze and tobacco in the middle. Oak, a touch of smoke, and sweet soy sauce in the finish and aftertaste. Body is full and oily. Slick and near flat on the palate. Chewy. Rich, thick, hot going down. Dry finish with a long lingering aftertaste. 

Just like it's VSOJ Barleywine cousin, this is near perfect."
1585,Herbabee,Double Barrel V.S.O.D.,4.75,"this lucky find was like the most loaded cola i could ever imagine.
sticky on the lips, savory, strong and creamy-fizzy on the tongue.
locking these remaining 4 (oops, 3) cans in a bank vault!"
1586,maximum12,Double Barrel V.S.O.D.,4.67,"Big thanks to gudbrande for this 12 oz. can as I seek to hunt down every Deep Woods brew in existence. The quest is going well, thank you, 

The pour is Yankee black without the link to a cold, dead soul. The nose is rich, bourbon, chocolate, burnt things. 

Double Barrel V.S.O.D. deals barrel. Heavy bourbon with a hint of spiciness (is there a rye barrel engaged?) smacks the palate barehanded accompanied by a deep, throat-scouring burn of booziness. Mid-palate is vanilla, chocolate, burnt oak, with lower levels of leather & brown sugar. Finishes with dry, dry oak. Full. So tasty I could drink this until I dropped (over/under at 26 ounces). 

It's a miracle! The double barrel aging takes what is (to me) a pretty routine stout & turns it into a borderline magical experience. Superb beer."
1587,MacMalt,Double Barrel V.S.O.D.,4.45,"Received from @fbarber in the NBS BIF #14. Canned on 12/3/2020. Poured into a Revolution stemless glass. It pours almost ink black with a thin, light mocha-colored head and lite lacing. On the nose there is milk chocolate caramel, earthy nuts, and lite but noticeable bourbon. The taste is big with rich chocolate, caramel, and lots of bourbon over an earthy, nutty malt base. The flavors blend beautifully. But it's very boozy. Its mouth feel is fantastic - rich, creamy, and viscous with low to moderate carbonation. There is no escaping the 17.8% ABV; it's a big, big Stout and most definitely a sipper. Overall, Double Barrel V.S.O.D. is just a great BA Imperial Stout. I've enjoyed every beer from the Deep Wood Series."
1588,emerge077,Double Barrel V.S.O.D.,4.31,"Dark brownish black with a finger of dark mocha foam, not much lacing or surface skim due to the higher abv. 

Aroma is bourbon forward, sweet and sticky fudgy brownies, caramelized sugar and vanilla.

Taste is drenched in bourbon, caramel and vanilla, rich fudgy brownies, ample bourbon flavor and heat that lingers. Has a bite to it, and it’s got lots of warmth. Medium bodied with some creaminess, the booze really cuts through. Overall really tasty, especially as a mid-winter sipper. Thanks to Chris for this one!"
1589,jrc1093,Double Barrel V.S.O.D.,4.29,"Canned on 12/3/20; consumed on 12/9/21

Pours an inky black body capped with a short-lived two fingers of tautly bubbly, rocky, burnt beige foam, fizzling out as quickly as it formed to yield a few paper-thin spots over a void-like surface, a thin, frothy collar, and no lacing holding to the walls of the glass.

Aroma shows robust chocolate malts at the forefront, detailing bakers chocolate and a milder brownie batter richness; hints of dark cherry over the middle are born from ripe bourbon undertones, with caramel and vanilla-imbued roast accentuating oak on the back end.

Taste opens with heavy doses of bourbon imparting oaky vanillins and toasty toffee details upfront; an ashy char over the mid-palate is softened by doughy cacao, while heavier char cuts through dark cocoa on the finish, a slight nutty sweetness lingering.

Mouthfeel brings a medium body with minimal carbonation tingling gently into a weighty slickness and deft char over the mid-palate; the warmth upfront coats the palate over time as a dryness evolves and trickles into the back end, the finish disguising its weight.

Impressively balanced barrels guide an amplified roasted malt decadence through layers of char across the profile and peaking with a residual bourbon sweetness; a level execution of multiple barrels at work allowing both the base beer to shine and the lingering spirit influence to accentuate."
1590,Victory_Sabre1973,Samuel Adams Cold Snap,3.59,"From a 12 oz bottle

Murky golden pouring beer with a thick 2 finger white head. Fluffy looking and very long lasting. Some pretty good lacing on the glass. 
Nose has hints or orange on it. Malty, biscuit aroma here. 
Taste - Slight orange flavor. Decent malt bill, but not extremely strong. I do get some bread and biscuit here.
Light body. Bubbly. Crisp. 
Similar to Blue Moon, not really better or worse."

T: Fruity tangerine/apricot flavor.
F: Crisp and light-ish, slightly watery.
O: OK."
1592,TheOccasionalBeer,Samuel Adams Cold Snap,3.17,"Faint scent of citrus, in the bottle and the glass, was accompanied by a couple of fingers of white foam in the latter; it rapidly collapsed into the cloudy apple juice-colored beer. After sitting a minute or two, the aroma developed a little more complexity, almost as if it was reading my review and adding a hint of apple. In the mouth, very faint carbonation and a slight viscosity had a flavor but I'm having trouble pinning it down (given its faintness)... slightly sour... like sour dough??? It's not unpleasant, just... not. If one wants something innocuous, this would probably go with almost anything."
1593,LeinenkugelDrinker,Samuel Adams Cold Snap,4.19,"I guess I never reviewed this beer. I purchase it every year in whichever variety pack it’s in. 

Look: Hazy yellow with an orange tinge. Good head. 
Smell: Spices, citrus, and little malt. 
Taste: A subtle orange flavor is noticeable, followed by a powerful coriander taste with a touch of maltiness. Absolutely delicious. 
Feel: Medium in the mouth. 
Overall: This beer is consistently excellent year in and year out. It is always the highlight of my January. I would definitely recommend this beer."
1594,Riverdivine8,Samuel Adams Cold Snap,4.45,"Absolutely delicious~
An unfiltered, wheat white ale, with a warm orange-yellow haze, still comes across as bright and clean. Is a wonderful balance of sweet and spice~ with bright orange, and warming ginger, and cinnamon notes. Both smooth, and spunky. Would have given it a 5, if it was a touch more dry, and a tiny bit less spice, but that is just my preference."

1601,haines710,Hazy Hearted IPA,3.93,"Picked this up as part of a variety 12 pack from Bell's. Best by date is June 2024, so still relatively fresh. Drinking from the can and the smell is not strong - i get hints of pineapple and citrus, but not bursting. The taste is stronger, but not as much flavor as i would expect from a hazy IPA. It has a good mouthfeel and i appreciate the bitter finish. Overall happy to have tried, but probably wouldn't pick up on its own."
1602,nasal,Hazy Hearted IPA,3.81,"Big sweet tropical fruit smell and aftertaste. To me, it's specifically very pineapple. It has the bitterness of Two Hearted (feels like maybe even more bitterness?) so it isn't overly tropical. Great feel for 7.5%, not too thin or too chewy. Solid beer."
1603,Darkmagus82,Hazy Hearted IPA,3.95,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass
Appearance – The beer pours a lightly hazy yellow-amber color with a small head of white foam. The head has a decent level of retention, fading over time and leaving a touch of streaky lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – The aroma of the brew is heavy of a bready smell mixed with some aromas of a tropical fruit nature of papaya and pineapple. There is a touch of tangerine and orange in there as well, with bits of a herbal and floral hop smell rounding it all out.
Taste – The taste begins with a cracker and bready malt flavor that has a rather strong showing of a grapefruit hop taste. There is a touch of tangerine and tropical fruit (papaya and pineapple) on the tongue as well, with the tangerine getting slightly stronger as the taste advances, all while the tropical flavors fade. All the while the herbal and floral characteristics that were in the nose, develop in the taste, and in the end, one is left with a moderately citrusy, but well hop blended, more crisp taste to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is a moderately crisp, with a carbonation level that is average. For the crisper tastes and blend of hop flavors the feel is rather nice and makes for an easy sipper.
Overall – A rather nice brew overall. On the more crisp side for a hazy, which I rather like."
1604,tone77,Hazy Hearted IPA,3.61,"Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a hazy golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of citrus, little else. Taste is juicy, oranges, lemons, mild bitterness. Feels medium/full bodied in the mouth and overall is an enjoyable beer."
1605,cyclonece09,Hazy Hearted IPA,4,"Poured from a can into a pint glass. Pours bright orange yellow with a nice white head. Smells of bright citrus and tropical fruit. Tastes of bright citrus with creamy tropical fruit notes. Beer is light bodied and easy drinking, good carbonation. Overall, a very good beer."
1606,whynot44,Treez Freez,4.17,"Opaque yellow color with a substantial and lasting frothy white head with plenty of nice lacing. The aroma is citrus. 
The taste is tangerine with a touch of grapefruit, lemon and white grapes, very juicy, mildly sweet. The finish dries out with some lingering citrus zest and pine, moderate bitterness. 
The body is medium/full, good carbonation level, creamy smooth and very drinkable. 
Altogether, this is a very tasty and refreshing IPA, although the flavor profile is simpler than some, it is very well executed, very enjoyable."
1607,smackdanie,Treez Freez,4.02,"Pours a fluffy, turbid pale yellow. Totally opaque. Leaves a nice lacing, and at first hides the alcohol well. As it warms, the boozyness comes forward. The nose is fairly faint, and smells of straight citra. Strong carbonation for a creamy looking beer, it doesn't come over as creamy as I expected. Another great beer by HB, but maybe next time dial up the pacific sunrise so we can see its properties more?"

Flavor: Strong flavors of orange citrus, white berries, pineapple, some hints of pine. (4.00)

1610,rankandfile,Willettized,4.88,"2023 edition - aged in Rye Whiskey Barrels. I am assuming this is a less sweet, more spicier version than prior Bourbon years. I genuflect to the higher ups; the people who don't have problems finding this beer year and year out.
One word: OUTSTANDING. The rush I felt of randomly finding it in a store I haven't been to in a very long time was akin to finding that rare BC BA private reserve circa 2010. That feeling was only supplanted by the exquisite and perfectly balanced stout.
BC's are now dime a dozen and they just don't taste the same anymore, KBS's never hit right with me, Willitized is perfection."

The initial smell is coffee and chocolate, followed by roast malt, a little woodiness. There's a sharper note which I assume is rye since it's on the label that rye barrels were used, and some woodiness. There's a fruit note that is like plum and cherry.

The taste is bigger, but still under control. It's got a fair amount of sweetness - chocolate and caramel-like. The coffee is prominent and very fresh tasting. There's plum and more of a raisin/fig taste than the cherry aroma. Spicy rye the build and some vanilla. I'm not getting any bourbon to speak of, and there's a mild woodiness. It's got a decent bitterness, and some char taste lingers.

Feel is a bit less than medium, nicely carbonated. There is a kind of chocolate tasting chalkiness on the back end of the swallow. Alcohol is warming but not intrusive. Smooth and a little creamy.

Overall, very good beer I'm glad to have tried. The price point is a a huge ""value boost"" for this beer. It's not the best in class in my opinion, but it's very good for the price point."
1612,Amboularozzo,Willettized,4.9,"Tastes like youre smoking a cigar. Rich fresh spicy tobacco notes from the rye. Super thick, coats the lips and palate, making the spicy balanced finish last forever"
1613,The_Snow_Bird,Willettized,4.02,Pours jet black with a caramel head that goes away quickly. Gives off a coffee with cream and sugar smell. Taste is of light coffee flavor with sugar added.
1614,Beers-es,Willettized,4.5,"From a bottle, pours pitch black with a beautiful dark tan head. Smell has chocolate, coffee, raisins, cherry, vanilla, oak and rye. Taste follows. Feel is smooth without being either thick or thin. This stuff deserves the world-class rating."
1615,guitarguyny,Willettized,4.48,One of the best stouts I’ve ever had… not to sweet and not too bitter.. damn near perfect!
1616,benandemmiboo,Willettized,4.68,"It's impossible to find a better-tasting, 12 percent ABV stout where you can buy a six-pack for $13 dollars or so. In terms of taste, I might even prefer it to Founders KBS, as the alcohol is a little less hidden. Somewhat reminiscent in overall taste to the Chop House Bourbon Barrel Stout, but stronger. If it ages well, as some suggest, all the better.
I bought a case."
1617,seakayak,Willettized,4.75,"-Look: Beautiful black-coffee color with a creamy tan cap.

1618,idResponse,Willettized,4.87,"You want a wood barrelled stout? You want some coffee with that? You creaving something sweet but not cloying, heavy as hell ABV but not noticed at all? You're there with this brew.
Fantastic in every fathom, everything I could ask for in a brew of this kind... They nailed it!
Also, I got lucky and managed to score a couple six packs at half the price it's supposed to sell at when Whole Foods forgot to change the price of the seasonal barcode.... EVEN BETTER!
This is one of the best things Lagunitas has ever done and I wish it could become a regular brew that's year round at a normal price. Give us more!!!"
1619,nasty15108,Willettized,4.05,"Poured from a 2019 Vintage Bottle into a small goblet.

L - Pours dark and syrupy. Thick with a thin tan head and very little lacing or retention.

S - Somewhere between an Irish Coffee made with Rye and a high quality Espresso Martini. Rich dark fruits and chocolate, almost like a Chunky Bar or Cadbury Fuiit & Nut Bar. Alcohol content also shows its hand in the aroma.

T - Strong Iced espresso, something along the lines of a high quality Caffe' Shakerato. The chocolate notes bring some sweetness into the mix. The alcohol is definitely present but not overpowering. 

F - Thick and unctuous. Sticks to your lips and fully coats the mouth. 

This is an outstanding beer, especially for the price point. This beer is big and bold and shouldn't be taken likely. I can't see myself having more than one or two of these in a sitting. That being said, I think this would work perfectly with a cigar, accompanied with a dessert or as a nightcap."
1620,Snowcrash000,Willettized,4.4,"Pours an opaque, pitch-black coloration with a medium, creamy head. Smells of roasted, caramel malt, chocolate, coffee and charred, bourbon-soaked oak. Taste is an excellent balance of roasted, caramel malt, chocolate, tobacco, ash and lighter vanilla and coffee, with hints of plum, raisin and rye spice, as well as some charred, bourbon-soaked oak. Finishes with a medium bitterness and some chocolate, tobacco, ash and charred oak lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a rich body and medium/low carbonation.

I would have loved to try this next to KBS as these are close contenders to me in terms of value for money and availability (from a US perspective), as well as KBS being one of my all-time-favorites. What I love about this one is the quite roasted and bitter character, which is enhanced by the charred oak and rye spice, although at about a year old, there is little coffee left here, which is a bit of a shame. It also doesn't seem quite as rich in body, mouthfeel and bourbon-presence as I remember KBS being, although my impression may be colored by nostalgia here. Overall, this makes for a terrific BBA Stout that doesn't quite live up to KBS for me though."
1621,Iamaskier,Willettized,4.18,"2022 
No head, black body. Sweet and boozy on the nose; caramel, fudge, vanilla notes, and just a hint of coffee. In the mouth, a few nutty and roasty notes upfront, vanilla, butterscotch, caramel, and hints of fudge. The only bitterness comes out on the finish, with a smidge of rye spice and coffee. I keep picking up prominent maple notes too. Feel is warm, slightly spicy, and oily smooth. Overall, I’m surprised at the lack of coffee. Did it lose it during the year in my fridge? Surprising if so. If I had it blind, I would guess it was a BA stout with maple… weird. Anyway, it’s a good BA stout, certainly on the sweet side, but nothing to make it stand out among other string BA stouts."
1622,BeerAndGasMasks,Folle Furieuz,3.93,"From the nicely labeled can, it pours a hazy amber color with a nice off-white head that slowly reduces and leaves lacing. The nose mostly gets a bit of malt, with some fruit (a friend said ""bad fruit"" but not unpleasant). The taste follows with a strong, sweetish flavor that is entirely easy to drink."
1623,Beginner2,Folle Furieuz,3.98,"When I first bought this sampler at Costco (which they better than anyone else I know), I was thrilled. Two brews from this French brewer I imagined next to the Belgian brewer. Already tasting the rich yeast and the pepper in this ""triple pale"" (thinking tripel), I could not wait to drink this. While my imagination and reality are not in-sync (as often is the case), I nonetheless was in for a treat and I hope you are too.

Furieuz is a stong pale brewed well, but without the BPSA traditional yeast. And that does not disqualify it; not in my book. Sutter is in the region surrounding Paris. They focus on yeast as an ingredient key to baking. They are not going to know what the Belgians know. More specific... Furieuz Looks invitingly great, a full active foam. (I also give points for the can's Looks, good fun.) Smells are mostly malt, telling me this could improve my mediocre meal of roasted potatoes and a medley of mustard and BBQ sauces. No sophisticated surprises, Tastes are consistent throughout; also helping to make it a good table ale. Sufficient bubbles to cleanse my palate for another gulp and bite. I wish the box had two copies.

As for my micro-review of Sutter... I could not get the English button on their website to work. Since this always makes me mad when Bavarian brewers do this, I will try to keep calm. But the box also has two others from Sutter, so they have time to fix the button. A Sante'!"

Big voluminous head that Looks inviting in my BA Respect Beer glass. A nice foam that sticks around. Smells are modestly malty, moderate hop aroma. Lots of lemon in the swallow that rebalances in the finish. A refreshing lager. Light to medium-mouthed. My mistake was to have this with dinner (the lemon got in the meal's way), when it would be a decent lunch beer.

For my micro-review of Steiger... their founding goes back to before Columbus discovered America. Their website has an interesting way of displaying Steiger's history. But unfortunately, I couldn't find an English button and Slovakian, for me, is way too much work. But I give Steiger good Overall Hugs for its longevity as a micro in a small town not near much."

1637,Beginner2,Vltavan,3.91,"Why do the colors and type on this can look to me so much like Pilsner Urquell. Is Brnovar copying the classic? Or do these colors have a cultural significance among Czech drinkers ? I'd like to think the latter. But the two lagers also taste very similar to this lover of ales.

As such, I had Vltavan as part of lunch; to wash it down and prepare me for a nap after playing tennis in the AM. (It all worked out... but the nap was best.) As for Vltavan, I'd appreciate a longer lasting foam and lace. Smells are classic mostly malt with the hops in the back of my nose. Tastes follow closely, but the hops take over in the finish... again classic. Medium-mouthed and stimulating on my tongue. A good lager at lunch.

My copy came from Costco in a European Beer Collection box, a good way to introduce obscure beers to the U.S.; much like Costco's Advent Calendar. Trying to follow the multi-year success of Advent Calendar, this Limited Edition box was organized and imported by a different firm, Webster Barnes, who I don't know but welcome this sort of work. Brnovar has two beers in the box and I give them a micro-review on my review of TUP... also worth having but not necessarily worth repeating."

Notes via stream of consciousness: A clear amber colored body with golden highlights rests beneath a thumb's width of white foam. Plenty of bubbles can be seen facing upwards within the glass. The aroma is clean, malty and bready with a touch of caramel, and spicy, grassy, and lightly herbal due to the hops. The taste follows quite closely, and a firm bitterness balances it and brings it to a mainly dry conclusion with some spicy hops left lingering. The combination of caramelish malt and spicy/grassy hops is really quite nice. It's medium bodied and crisp across the palate. If there's a fault here it's that the head retention and lacing weren't the best they could have been, otherwise it's fairly classic.

O: finally got to try this one"
1640,Roguer,Vanilla Porter,3.98,"Big notes of vanilla on the nose, along with a modest roasty character. Red grape, caramel, toffee, coffee round out the profile.

Slightly sharp up front; very nutty in the middle, as though peanuts entered the mix with the vanilla. Vanilla is noticeable, but not quite as rich and smooth as on the nose.

Drinks a touch fuller and richer than the modest ABV.

Solid vanilla porter, but a couple of odd notes - not unpleasant, just odd - keep this one below greatness for me."
1641,Chickenhawk9932,Vanilla Porter,4.1,"Pours as black as midnight oil with a coffee colored head. 

Vanilla, coffee, chocolate, roasted dark bread, and fudge. 

Vanilla and fudge with some nice bitter coffee interplay = delicious."
1642,Wattie83,Vanilla Porter,3.9,"12oz can poured into a tulip glass. Look is dark brown, khaki head that falls off to a cap with a solid ring around the glass, leaves some lacing behind. Smell is vanilla and milk chocolate. Taste is sweet vanilla and cocoa up front. Vanilla does taste like extract. Middle sees some bitterness and a bit of dark chocolate and sweetened coffee. Finish is vanilla and cream. Feel is light to medium with a pretty low level of carbonation. Overall, this is a sweeter porter which I like, but I can see where others might be out. It's not a very ""deep"" beer, but a good sipper nonetheless. I'd buy again just to have as an easy option in the fridge."
1643,ChainGangGuy,Vanilla Porter,2.95,"12 ounce can - $2.00 at Woodstock Beer Market in Woodstock, Georgia.

Canned On 11.14.23.

Appearance: Dispenses a very dark brown body with a tall, lace-giving, foamy beige head.

Smell: Ah, geez. Like a corpse on the sidewalk, just laying atop the lovely dark, chocolaty, lightly roasty malts is what seems to be a rather artificial vanilla extract note. Ew.

Taste: Sweet dark malts yielding coffee and chocolate tones though that disagreeable phoney-baloney vanilla extract just thoroughly and quickly muddies up the taste and does not relent even well beyond the supposed finish, like some turkey scrapped a package of cheap vanilla sandwich cookies into what otherwise is a top-notch adult beverage.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium carbonation. Lightly creamy, though a displeasing tongue-coating quality from the extract.

Overall: While the standard-issue delivers a sterling, tasty robust porter and one I freely, even cheerfully recommend to others, this fake vanilla dosed one is a free and open target to slap out of someone's hand. Don't do it!"
1644,Beginner2,Vanilla Porter,3.92,"I try to enjoy an experiment derived from a classic. While I enjoyed Vanilla Porter, it probably will not be a successful experiment unless it manages to make the vanilla seem less artificial. Using cheap vanilla cheapens this porter.

But pouring it into my BA Respect Beer glass, Vanilla Looks great; a big, abundant head of coffee foam... but it could stick more to the glass. Smells meet me with mostly malt and vanilla. Only in the Taste does the vanilla seem artificial; otherwise a balanced brew despite the hefty IBU. Full to medium-mouthed. To my pleasure, I paired Vanilla with Christmas cookies. If I have Vanilla again, it will only be with chocolate cookies."

Smell: Slightly charred, with chocolate and vanilla tones and just a hint of coffee

Taste: The char carries through from start to finish with the chocolate and vanilla flavors intermingling; after the swallow, there is an odd, almost chemical element that detracts from the finish

Mouthfeel: Medium body with moderate carbonation; creamy

Overall: An enjoyable robust porter but I cannot get over the odd taste in the finish"
1647,GreesyFizeek,Vanilla Porter,3.79,"This one pours a very dark black color, with a big fluffy head, and lots of lacing.

This smells pretty vanilla forward, slightly artificial but not overly so. There’s lots of roast, and a nice coffee like flavor.

This is absolutely not an improvement on Founders Porter, but that’s mainly that’s a beer that simply cannot be improved upon. The vanilla flavor here feels just slightly artificial, but it’s still tasty, almost cake-like, with a ton of roasted notes, and some coffee. The can promises “subtle coffee notes” – it feels pretty coffee heavy even without coffee in it.

This is medium bodied, and fairly creamy, with a pretty nice drinkability.

I wasn’t entirely sure what to expect here – even though it’s slightly artificially sweet, that doesn’t really detract fully as the base porter is so superior."

T: Following the nose I get grainy malt character, a bit of malty sweetness, a light herbal note, and light bitterness on the backend and finish. 

F: Light bodied with medium plus carbonation. The mouthfeel is a bit creamy with a crisp dry finish.

O: I don't detect any adjunct character and If I didn't know better I would think this was an all malt beer. For an American adjunct lager this one is pretty good.

Taste follows with a soft, but lighter-bodied, baker's chocolate, a hint of caramel, and a prominent bourbon boozy finish. For a black barleywine, this wasn't as complex and expressive as you would like...from the stout nor the barleywine side. Pretty good, but it would have been better with a more viscous/heavier mouthfeel IMO."
1674,SpeedwayJim,On & On: Part 3,4.13,"16oz. Can into a Side Project snifter. 

Pours looks thin. Wispy head. Thin legs. No lace. Nose is chocolate, molasses, and syrup. Some hints of cocoa powder and lactose. Aromatic, rich, boozy. Beer opens chocolate, fudge, and cocoa powder. Molasses, syrup, and milk chocolate in the middle. Booze, Hershey's, and hints of honey at the finish. Body is full with moderate carbonation. Smooth and rich on the palate and goes down hot. Long, lingering, sticky aftertaste. 

Very solid. Lots of cocoa in this one."
1675,pathman,On & On: Part 3,4.5,02/24/24 can @ Papa B’s
1676,4DAloveofSTOUT,On & On: Part 3,4.38,"16oz tallboy can poured into Deep Woods branded stemless tulip aka the Rastal Lawrence.

Appearance: dark brown to light black body with a nice big khaki colored head that pours up really tall over three fingers tall and slowly drops to a thin cap. Eventually a thick ring around the glass. 

Smell: caramel punches through to your nose first with a nice oak and bourbon compliment. The roasted malts are easily identified by the aroma of this beer. It smells sweet and rich.

Taste: Pretty similar to the nose it starts off with the caramel and presents like a sweet English Barelywine. Mid palate you get the transition to dry and roasty malts. The finish has mellow spirits and mellow sweetness that doesn't linger on for too long, then a dry oak starts to dry out the finish. Hint of maple and honey in the finish as well. 

Mouthfeel: Thinner bodied beer that is more has a Revolution ""beer body"" to this beer than a Half Acre ""beer body"". Not much booze to this beer it's a very easy sipper. It's got a nice creaminess texture to it as well.

Overall: tried all the components at Revolution on release day. Now the blend in all its finality. The parts are all lesser than the sum of it's parts and this turned out very nice going into this knowing what the blended components were. I will also say as a ""technical side note"" according to the beer style guidelines of BeerAdvocate beer styles this would technically be an American Strong Ale and not a Double Barrel-Aged Stout as Revolution and Half Acre have named it. This is also the least favorite of all three of the On & On beers done so far by Revolution and Half Acre; Part 1 and part 2 where much better."
1677,GuyFawkes,On & On: Part 3,4,"Canned 1/5/24; drank 1/29/24 @ the Yarchives. 

Brown/black appearance. 

A rough pour yielded a big, noisy tan head which quickly dissipated; decent lacing remained. 

Milk chocolate, cream soda, marshmallow & oak notes in the nose. 

Medium thick, creamy mouthfeel. 

Oak, cream soda & mild milk chocolate flavors up front; mild booze heat notes on the finish. 

Pretty balanced & interesting, but not the most impressive flavor from the Deep Wood series, and in fact it's my least favorite On & On by a smidge. Not bad at all, and certainly worth a quaff, but in the pantheon of Revolution barrel aged beers it's not upper echelon."
1678,mvanaskie13,Field Guide,3.88,"Poured into a shaker pint glass: color is straw gold, hazy but not to murky, head presents two fingers thick at least twice on the neeed pours to empty can, head is brighter white fine fine bubbles. 

Smell is one of the more aromatic NE HIPAs I've had in recent memory - but its heavy dank/onion, lighter tropical, some stone fruit but its pungent for NT; limited malt. 

Taste is less dank, more citrus, some peach, maybe light tropical, notes of biscuit and oats. 

Mouthfeel is low carbonation, moderate sweetness, lower bitterness, lingering sweetness. 

Overall a brighter but still sweet HIPA - more pronounced aroma than most DHIPAs from NT, flavor seems thin."
1679,TheBigBoy,Field Guide,3.35,"Breaks me to say, but this NT disappounted s little. Still a quality NEIPA but this one drinks likes a coors light version of NTs better NEIPAs. Very watered down which makes this very drinkable and refreshing yet not hsve the complexity often crave. A lawnmower beer or summer sipper...YES...a one or two drinker exploration...No!"
1680,322wingedfoot,Field Guide,4.15,Another very nice hazy IPA from NT. Pours an amber-yellow with a subdued nose of citrus and stone fruit. Certainly peach and citrus on the palate with a pleasantly bitter finish.
1681,dbl_delta,Field Guide,3.99,"Undated can into pint glass. Pours a hazy light gold with a small but persistent off-white head. Good lacing. Initial impression is citrus, peach, and stone fruits - all of which fit together nicely. Mouthfeel is medium and fairly soft. Finish fades to sweetish citrus. Overall, a very drinkable and enjoyable NEIPA. Nicely done."
1682,MikeWard,Field Guide,4.03,"16oz can into a pint glass. No freshness dating, but a cert recent release by NT.

Pours like your standard hazy, not as thick as most. Streaks of lacing. Aroma seems mostly of stone fruit. On tasting, it seems quite mild, but the subtle balance of the grain bill and the restraint of the hops make for a very smooth, easy drinking NEIPA. Abv well hidden, but at 6 percent, you could enjoy the best part of a 4 pack in a session. Nice beer."
1683,jzeilinger,Voodoo Ranger Cryo Ranger IPA,3.08,"On tap.

A - Medium gold with thin lacing and light carbonation.

S - Light malt and stale fruit.

T - Very faded fruity citrus and ends on the sweeter side, fruitiness begins to build after the sip and leaves a cloying sugary residue.

M - Medium.body with light carbonation.

O - Unfortunatly this was pretty lame and guessing it was an old keg. Will revisit again in the future."
1684,Mark-Leggett,Voodoo Ranger Cryo Ranger IPA,4.49,"Poured from a can. Golden in color with a white head and some lacing. Smells of tropical fruit, pine and hops. Flavors of pine, tropical fruit and sweet undertones. Flavor is very good."
1685,Darkmagus82,Voodoo Ranger Cryo Ranger IPA,3.98,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass
Appearance – The beer pours a clear golden amber color with a two finger height head of white foam. The head has a good level of retention, fading over time and leaving a ton of lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – The aroma is heaviest of a grainy and cracker malt smell mixed with notes of melon and a hint of lemon. Along with these smells comes notes of grape and a bit of herbal and grapefruit hop and a touch of must.
Taste – The taste starts with a crisp cracker malt backbone with some grape and a little bit of melon. There is some herbal and pine hops that persist throughout, adding a nice backbone hop flavor. As the taste advances some light lemon and orange join in, and with some flavors of grain and a bit of earth, one is left with a crisp and moderately dank hopped taste to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is a bit thinner and more crisp with a higher level of carbonation. For the flavors and the crisp tastes the feel is nice and makes for an easy sipper.
Overall – A rather decent IPA overall, with a more dank hop profile and a clean crisp flavor profile."
1686,Mdog,Voodoo Ranger Cryo Ranger IPA,3.83,"From a 12oz can:

Appearance: Clear yellow, big head.

Smell: Citrus, melon note.

Taste: Mild sweetness, then the taste is a lot of honeydew melon. Not over-the-top melon Fanta, but solid melon. Low carbonation leads to a slick mouthfeel.

Overall: Saw some good reviews here on BA so sprang for a 6 pack. Interesting beer, quite a bit of melon flavor, which was what got me interested in the first place. Worth a try."
1687,WoodBrew,Voodoo Ranger Cryo Ranger IPA,4,I brought a 6pck of cans of this beer from my local meijer store. It poured a clear copper with white head that is leaving some lace. The scent had subtle dank tropical fruit notes. The taste was nicely balanced and easy to drink with bright semi sweet malt base with crisp tropical fruit presence. The mouthfeel was medium in body and had good carbonation. Overall it is a great beer.
1688,whynot44,Voodoo Ranger Cryo Ranger IPA,4.07,"Clear golden color with a decent and lasting white head and plenty of nice lacing. 
The aroma is citrus, peach, white grapes and pine. 
The taste is tangerine, grapefruit, lemon, plum, white grapes and a hint of honeydew. The finish is dry with lingering citrus zest and pine resin, moderate bitterness. 
The body is light/medium, good carbonation level, smooth and very drinkable. 
Altogether, this is a very nice IPA, tasty and refreshing, leaves you wanting one more."
1689,Hunterdietz,Coors Light,2.71,"Coors Light is a good beer in comparison to the other light beers it gets compared to (Busch, Bud, etc.) However, I think it's a crime to choose this over Banquet when available. Not nearly as flavorful and much more watery in feel."
1690,GoBlue16,Coors Light,3.71,Delicious!
1691,Luscious_Malfoy,Coors Light,3.56,draft pour into tall pilsner glass. clear golden yellow with not quite two fingers of white foam head. not a lot to the taste or smell. typical america adjunct with corn / ethanol and grist / grain in the finish. less than medium mouthfeel. is it drinkable? sure. are there always better options. yes.
1692,White_Dragon,Coors Light,2.38,"Review from memory, in fairness, only b/c I was just trying some other light beers… 

As a light American beer it’s ok. Better than bud or Blue lite as it’s somewhat less watery, it’ll do at golf or winding down so long as it’s cold…"
1693,odannyob,Coors Light,2.58,"If I was trying to lose weight (which I'm not) and thought by drinking copious tankards of these I would not gain weight then I would be erroneous because I couldn't drink these anymore, thus losing weight! 
Thank goodness there are so many other beers out there these days. So many beers, so little time. 
So, I have tried a ""Coors Light"". Enjoy! If this beer is all you want."
1694,Pilsguy,Coors Light,4.48,"Crisp Pilsner, which is what millions enjoy. Perfect if you want a “few”"
1695,lflotron,Coors Light,4.44,Pretty good. Poor rating doesn't make sense.
1696,ElijahLep,Coors Light,1.89,Tastes like a cheap beer. Nothing special about it. Drinkable but something I would never get again
1697,bullwinkle88,Coors Light,2.48,"Doesn’t look like much but it’s good for its category. You know what you’re getting. Here are the positives: it’s available absolutely everywhere And it’s better than most craft brewers’ “here’s our take on a light macro for 12.99”
Every now and then you need to reign it in to drop a few LBS and coors will be your friend in that regard. The only better light beer is labatts light but that is scarce depending on where you are"
1698,stortore,Sapporo Premium Beer,3.53,"11.2 ounce bottle into a pilsner glass. Had 1/25/24.

Pours a clear, lighter golden color, with a two inch foamy head with decent retention and some foamy lacing. Active carbonation. Aromas of yeast and malt. Smells a little earthy and herbal. Tastes like it smells. Yeast, malt, herbal and earthy. There’s a little spiciness to it. Smooth, a good very light body, well carbonated. 

Better than expected. Especially for how really light it is , but it’s not watery. Displays the yeast and malt proudly, if also lightly."
1699,USairforce20069985,Sapporo Premium Beer,3.73,"I have had this beer a couple times over the last few years and to be all honest its pretty good. 

Look: clear golden straw look, with small foamy head that goes away pretty quickly.

Smell: grainy with rice and straw notes. 

Taste: very smooth and clean with rice notes along with a bready like taste
Feel: very refreshing on the palate, the drinkability is very strong in that I felt like I could have several of these in one sitting and not get tired of it. 
Overall: a good beer to relax too after a long day at work!"
1700,Sabtos,Sapporo Premium Beer,2.72,"Clear golden with a moderately short, airy off-white foam head

A bubbly, tingly carbonation delivers a little light caramel, toasted cornbread, grape skin, and a touch of metallic allium."
1701,Nath91,Sapporo Premium Beer,3.5,"Japanese Rice Lagers are nice, the rice adjunct gives the beer the pleasant smoothness, and has more character than your American adjunct flavours. 

Vessel: 330ml brown bottle. This is brewed under license in Australia by Coopers. Generally beers brewed under license in Australia are poor, but Coopers do it better than Asahi/CUB or Lion/Tooheys. 

Appearance: Clear Pale straw appearance. Not as dark straw as an Australian lager, not as pale as a European Pale lager. Somewhere in the middle. Completely filtered, thin 1cm frothy white head, that is sticking around longer than most Aussie lagers. 

Aroma: Strong smell of steamed white rice, and pale bisuity malt. No real hop aroma. 

Taste: Smooth and clean. White rice, sweet biscuity malt, ever so slight bitterness at the end of the sip. It's smooth and clean. 

Feel: Rice gives it a creamyish texture, but it's smooth and highly drinkable. 

Overall: Japanese lagers are excellent for their overall innoffensiveness. They simple, clean and refreshing, and it's perfectly suited to pairing with a myriad of foods from different cultures, or just quenching ones thirst. Sapporo does all that the above asks for. It's clean, smooth and refreshing.

1702,Luscious_Malfoy,Sapporo Premium Beer,3.82,"poured from a 22oz can into a konig ludwig weissbier tall glass. pours clearer straw gold with two fingers of white foam head. pretty tame in the nose and taste. lager yeast, light grass and even lighter lemon and herbal, earthy hops. medium-full mouthfeel. not as crisp and carbonated as i recalled this being but i could definitely be misremembering as i’ve not had this for years. i don’t mind it."
1703,Lanoke12,Sapporo Premium Beer,3.09,"Look is light yellow. Smell is thin and sweet. Taste is mild and inoffensive. Feel is thin and light. Overall, a decent macro beer. Light and inoffensive, it is a good break from heavier beers."

1705,Death_Adder,Sapporo Premium Beer,3,"I had to get this in the 22oz can, that looks sturdy enough to knock a B out with, the 22oz can cost me 5 dollars, which is highly unacceptable, but it’s been on my beers to review list for forever. Pale in color, crisp and sweet on the tongue, overall a kind of average lager. I’d much rather just pick up some Asahi Super Dry.

Style: Japanese Lager | Tap/Can/Bottle: Can | Abv: 4.9% | Rating: 3"
1706,LeinenkugelDrinker,Sapporo Premium Beer,3,All around it’s a decent beer. Good flavor. Solid 3 on all levels. A bit overpriced. Good with sushi! Been boycotting since those assholes shut down Anchor Brewing.
1707,Dylan184183,Sapporo Premium Beer,3.53,"Nothing special, but nothing bad. Don't like the price though"
1708,AzImbiber,Sapporo Premium Beer,2.99,"Big Steel Can: one. $2.99 on sale. Easily worth $1.19 (inflation).

Mouthfeel is exactly like an American/Mexican adjunct lager: thin, some carbonation, no residue like bitterness or metallic and altogether clean. I'm a big fan of adjunct lager.

Where this is different than macro lager: it's maltier (tastier; is it really barley?), flavor profile punched up. noticeable sweet taste, rice-y. I typically drink 4.5 abv for my work-week beer--- I have nice little buzz most of the way thru this can so it's gotta be 5% abv or more.

If I had a second can I'd probably open it, too. It's good beer...but more of a once-in-a-while, novelty beer to me. Not a daily drinker. I'm torn on why I'm rating it so high but would only try one again next year...that's how the dice roll on this one."
1709,GuyFawkes,Vacant for Winter,4,"Canned 12/27/23; drank 1/19/24 @ Roadrunner Lodge. 

Semi-opaque dark orange appearance. 

A rough pour yielded a huge off-white head; a thick curtain of tree-rung lacing remained. 

Pineapple, mango & dry grass notes in the nose. 

Medium mouthfeel. 

Pineapple, spring water & pine flavors. 

Nice old school American IPA vibes. I'd have another."
1710,RaulMondesi,Vacant for Winter,4.25,"Mother goose loves her children. But she does know that they have to grow up, and they have to be let free. Even though she knows the wolf may be out there, keeping them to herself and coddling is even worse. This Beer is mother goose letting her children go and it’s f—-ing awesome."
1711,augustgarage,Vacant for Winter,4.26,"Packaged on December 27, 2023 - consumed on January 14, 2024 - poured from a pint can into my Dogfish Head shaped pint glass. 

Lightly cloudy amber to gold gradient with a fat fist of dense ivory up top. Excellent retention, thick, sticky tendrils of lace.

Resinous, lightly spicy/floral aroma with candied ginger, tangerine, lime, and faint tropical notes (guava?) as well. Restrained yet inviting.

Bright, fruit-forward, gently floral palate entry. Moderate but persistent bitterness alongside a complex array of hop flavors offset with a clean crackery malt bill leading into a mineral-laden (hints of white wine grapes) dry finish. Some residual earthy/herbal flavors. 

Medium-bodied, creamy, yet zesty and well carbonated. Lightly warming/hearty yet refreshing.

Another wonderful seasonal variation from Pizza Port - lots of synergy going on with the hops (Citra/Idaho 7 for fruit; Loral for herbal/earthy notes, and Mosaic to tie everything together?) with a lean clean backbone."
1712,mactrail,Vacant for Winter,3.94,"Hops are listed as Mosaic, Idaho 7, Citra, and Loral. Pours a clear golden amber in the Frydenlund nonic, and plenty of foam. Aromatic with strawberry and grapefruit. Quite sudsy and lively in the mouth. An interesting resiny taste with a variety of citrus. Some tastes of plum or maybe blueberry. Pleasant mix of flavors with a moderate but distinct bitterness. Clean and crisp with some malty flavor as well. The 16 oz can is dated 12/27/23, just a couple weeks ago. Purchased at PP in San Clemente."
1713,2beerdogs,Vacant for Winter,3.99,"Canned 12/12/23...Fresh
Beautiful! Clear gold. Frothy white head is densely packed and stays more than a finger high for the entire ride! Solid lacing too.
Aroma is Mosaic forward: citrus zest, tangerine, orange rind, and hints of berry and grass.
Flavor really washes around with various citrus notes in the fore, followed by tads of peach, blueberry, and even hints of pine. As it warms, a floral dank note comes through as well.
On the fuller side of IPA in feel, moderate carbonation, and a slightly drying bitterness closes it out."
1714,BillAfromSoCal,Vacant for Winter,4.26,"Pours crystal clear light to medium gold color topped by only 1/2 finger of very dense white head (in a perfect pint glass with etched carbonation initiation grid). Leaves some nice lacing, and the head stays intact forever in this glass.. The appearance is really impressive. Very nice smell and taste leaning toward citrus rind+floral dominant. Nice amount of bitterness but by no means overpowering; this does NOT need food to be palatable. Medium body. Very fine carbonation on the tongue. Crisp, dry finish."
1715,Gatch,Vacant for Winter,4.35,"Pint on-tap at Solana Beach. Released just a few days ago. What seems to be a new seasonal IPA. Another dank, delicious WC IPA from one of the OG brewers. Super floral with the classic dry finish. Tasty!"
1716,Whyteboar,Best Brown Ale,4.15,"Had on tap at Vitale’s in Ada, MI. Waitress stated that it was the freshest tap they had.
Poured closer to an amber color than brown, but the head was a good inch tall and left sheets of lacing.
The taste had light chocolate and caramel flavors along with what I could only describe as nutmeg- I’m sure that’s not right, but I did get something similar.
The feel was very good, almost too easy to slam down.
OA, I enjoyed this more than I thought I would, may need to pick up a 6 pack."
1717,Luscious_Malfoy,Best Brown Ale,4.24,poured from a 12oz can into a half pint glass. pours an extremely light brown and even settles in the glass closer to amber than brown with a two finger off-white foam head. little bit of chocolate on the nose with some earthy hops. taste follows with a medium-full mouthfeel. haven’t had this one in years but enjoy it just as much as i remembered liking it.
1718,AZgman,Best Brown Ale,4,"Poured from a 12 oz can into a pint glass. Nice head and aroma. Definite caramel finish, but not too sweet. This is close to a Sam Smith's Nutbrown Ale which is my go to standard for brown ales, so that says something.

I got this in a Bells variety pack at Costco at a bargain price to boot."
1719,cyclonece09,Best Brown Ale,3.93,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Pours deep red with a small off white head. Smells of fruit and nuttiness. Tastes of nuttiness and nice caramelized grain. Beer is light bodied and easy drinking, good carboation. Overall,"
1720,FredTetusky1952,Best Brown Ale,4.02,I love brown ales. This one is great. The flavor has many different tones. Love that roaster barley. Bells knows how to do it! Good job Larry!
1721,GarrettB,Best Brown Ale,3.67,"October 30th, 2016 - It is difficult for me to get excited by brown ales. But every once in awhile one comes along that offers something new and exciting, and Bell's American Brown Ale is one of those. I'm drinking it straight from the bottle today, so there's not much aroma for me to parse, but the flavor is excellent, and well supported by the mouthfeel. There's a profound depth of toffee and apple (though not a candied apple), and the flavor leans a little on the sweeter side. But the mild fig touch at the front of the palate eases me into the sweeter brew. The aftertaste is also short, escorting the sweeter notes away quickly enough to just be missed."
1722,DaveMaciolek21,Best Brown Ale,3.68,"Muddy brown pour with an off-white head. This is a gentle beer--hints of caramel, a moderate roasty quality that never gets too BIG. Smooth texture makes it silky down the hatch. Great malt/hop balance. This is a wonderful beer to accompany the first falling leaves."
1723,milkshakebeersucks,Trail Pass IPA (Non-Alcoholic),3.99,"Large white head compliments the pale gold body while leaving a ring of lace. First whiff after popping the top was heavy on the citrus and pine but seemed to fade after sitting a bit. Taste mimics the WCIPA-style; more citrus and resinous rather than over-the-top fruitiness. Fairly bitter, well carbonated, medium-to-light bodied mouthfeel. Overall, a notch or two above my most recent NA samplings."
1724,epoole3,Trail Pass IPA (Non-Alcoholic),4.3,"Love the packaging, the perfect carbonation, the balanced nose and refreshing hops. I know this will be a consistently quality product that I can rely on for times I am abstaining. Mouthfeel is authentic and substantial. Flavors are bright, albeit light citrus hops."
1725,jonphisher,Trail Pass IPA (Non-Alcoholic),3.65,"Pale color, mostly clear, decent white head forms; but quite bubbly and deflates semi quickly. 

Nose is nicely hoppy; there is some citrus that comes of nice and pithy but underlying that is a smell similar to wort. 

The taste is similar but has a wortness to it like the nose; comes off as hop tea like if you’ve had those from hoplark but with just a hint of malt/grain. The hops are pretty nice though, same citrus but with some vegetal undertones. 

Not water, feel of a medium light beer, light bitterness and clean with an odd astringency on the finish. 

I haven’t had many NA beers so take my review with a grain of salt because I don’t have much reference. This one is pretty good though and it grew on me as I drank it."
1726,mikeinportc,Trail Pass IPA (Non-Alcoholic),3.91,"Translucent medium gold with light, white head, that hangs around for a couple of minutes. 

Smell is a moderate mixed citrus , with a tiny hint of green onion, that disappears as the head fades. Smells like a pale ale, with no sign of the usual cardboard/worty NA aroma. 

Taste is light mixed citrus, leaning to lemon/lime soda, with very slight green onion. As it warms, there is slight bread crust (not cardboard ;) ) at, and after, finish. Light bitterness. 

Feel is light, but not watery. Carbonation is moderate, with very,very fine, semi-soft tingle. Some dryness after finish.

Overall, a really good job of NA. New favorite NA. I'll get this again. :)"
1727,BeerAndGasMasks,Trail Pass IPA (Non-Alcoholic),3.56,"From the can, it pours a clear golden color with a nice white head that slowly reduces. The nose gets some stewed grain and some citrus. The mouth follows. Decent NA overall, however."
1728,Griffi,Trail Pass IPA (Non-Alcoholic),4,"Best NA beer I've ever had. Far better than Athletic, sorry..."
1729,TheYeasticandoo,Trail Pass IPA (Non-Alcoholic),5,"This is Delicious! My new No. 1 NA. Most NA “IPA’s” tend to fall short of actually tasting like an IPA because of the nature of what they are - they will never have the kick that a real IPA has to bring out all its character, but that’s ok! Because in the NA world, when a NA IPA is done well, it can become more reminiscent of a really nice Medium Pale Ale, and makes for a fine daily drinker, a great go-to beer for any occasion or for no reason at all. This is how i feel about SN Trail Pass IPA. Its just so damn tasty and drinks like a really good regular beer. I could drink these all day. So glad they came out with these. Trail Pass IPA is perhaps the most perfectly balanced, flavorful, subtly hoppy but not obnoxiously so, smooth, easy drinking and easily accessible among the stalwart examples of the style. Indeed, i would go so far as to say it occupies the “Goldilocks Zone” of NA beers. They really got this one JUST RIGHT. IMHO, Trail Pass IPA deserves the No.1 spot on the rating list in the NA category."
1730,Tucquan,Trail Pass IPA (Non-Alcoholic),3.87,"Had this on 2024-01-06 near Pittsburgh, PA from a 12oz canned on 2023-11-10

L - Semi-hazy gold with a 1-finger white head and light lace

S - Bread crust, light orange, herbal and floral. Mild but pleasant.

T - Lightly toasted sourdough bread, orange peel, white pepper. Orange zest bitterness, mild for an IPA.

F - Light-medium body and medium carbonation. Refreshing.

O - I enjoyed Sierra Nevada's take on a NA IPA. Good job eliminating almost all of the worty flavor and aroma from residual aldehydes often found in non-alcoholic beers. I like this better than their Trail Pass Golden. It is more complex. It compares favorably with Industrial Arts Safety Glasses IPA, which is also NA."
1731,GreesyFizeek,Lunar Throne,4.06,"Can purchased and drank at Fattey Beer Company in Rochester, NY.

This one pours a slightly hazy orange color, with a small head and lots of lacing.

This smells fairly mango-ey, with a pleasantly piney aroma, with some earthiness, pineapple, and grapefruit.

Three Floyds excels more at West Coast (Indiana-style?) IPAs, but this is a fairly solid bridge between that and purely hazy New England style IPAs. It’s fairly tropical, with a pleasantly earthy and piney bitterness, and a juicy mango, grapefruit, and pineapple sort of vibe going on.

This is medium bodied, pleasantly smooth and creamy, with a nice drinkability.

I very much dig the easier access to the basic Three Floyds beer locally these days."
1732,Chickenhawk9932,Lunar Throne,4.16,"Pours a hazy pale yellow with a tall creamy white head that leaves trails of lace down the glass. 

Smells of floral hops, tropical fruit, and a touch of earthy must. 

Floral and fruity hops with musty earth yeast and whole grain bread malt."
1733,AdmiralOzone,Lunar Throne,3.8,"Pours cloudy orange with a thick but short-lived white head. Spotty lacing. Aroma is full of a mix of citrus and tropical fruits. Flavor follows the nose, a nice mix of slightly sweet and slightly bitter. Feel is medium bodied and well carbonated. Overall, another NEIPA that just fits right into that category without any special attributes."
1734,bobhits,Lunar Throne,1.57,"It's not normal is the slogan and either my nose is REALLY off or they nailed that objective. 

Nose - onions, garlic, light fruits, slight cane sugar. I've certainly had some hints of onion before but never with such a dry malt base.

Taste - pretty much what you expect. Savory spices with a rather thin body IPA behind it.

Feel - kinda thin, the body really was lost in the glass. Maybe drink this one out of the can?

Bottom line, I don't like this at all. This one can go with Alice, straight to the moon!"
1735,ramseye4,Lunar Throne,4.03,"Hazy orange with big head. Gets a bonus quarter point for the sick can design 

S- oh my. Much more potent than most hazies. Orange and other citrus, pine, bright floral notes, hibiscus.

T juice, fruit, a bit of fresh bread, some mango and pineapple. Slightly richer than other hazies I’ve had

M- pops

Overall- it’s slightly better than most hazies which means it’s actually a good beer. I just think it’s hard for beers in this style to stand out or distinguish themselves"
1736,Darkmagus82,Lunar Throne,4.24,"Poured from a can into a pint glass 
Appearance – The beer pours a super hazy orange-yellow color with a one finger height head of white foam. The head has a good persistence, fading slowly and leaving a bit of foamy lace on the sides of the glass. 
Smell – The aroma is heavy of a bready and orange juice citrus smell mixed with other aromas of grapefruit and herb and a bit of lemon. Along with these smells comes notes of hay and yeast as well as a touch of pepper and tropical fruits of mango and pineapple.
Taste – The taste starts out with a bready malt flavor mixed with a lot of the citrus that was in the nose. There is a rather sizable grapefruit hop and orange juice flavor paired with some tangerine and mango. At eh same time there is a yeastiness and a bit of herb, both of which gets stronger as the taste advances. A bit of stone fruits (apricot, and peach) develop more toward the end, and with a bit of the pepper and lemon that were in the nose, one is left with a juicy and rather citrusy taste to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is thick and heavy for a 7.3 % beer with a lighter carbonation level. Quite nice for the juicy nature and the hop blend in this one. Overall, a nice sipper.
Overall – A rather flavorful and highly drinkable hazy. Well-crafted overall."
1737,Roguer,Frosted Triple Shot Barrel Blend,4.47,"Decent head production; poor retention.

Aroma is rich and wonderful, prominently featuring bourbon, vanilla, and coffee. Additional notes of caramel, toffee, chocolate, and molasses.

As impressive as the nose is, this beer immediately delivers on the palate. Bourbon and vanilla are a wonderful marriage up front, leading quickly into a strong coffee note. Additional notes of toffee, honeycomb, molasses, chocolate, and cherry.

Thick and chewy beer.

Overall, an absolutely lovely and decadent entry in Tree House's Single/Double/Triple/Quadruple Shot series."

S: Caramelized malts, lightly floral, a hint of hard candy, distant black bread.
T: Lightly rich dark caramelized malts, background cocoa, a hint of char, sweet dark over ripe fruits akin to plum, raisins, dates, a slightly complex array of hop notes (Mosaic?) where bitterness is almost rye-like.
F: Lightly brisk then fairly smooth medium-bodied feel with a medium-length moderately drying clean finish. Lightly fluffy at the end.
O: An easy-drinking 7% beer for sure. Super clean. Nice balance btwx sweet & bitter. Superior taste with a good feel. I would like this beer with almost any fish or seafood. It is VG to excellent in its style."
1739,nasal,Change of Heart Experimental Black IPA,3.83,"Lovely deep color. Tastes like a few shots of homebrew stout in a Bell's beer. For me, the hops are bitter, not fresh-piney or citric or complex, and the roasted maltiness has little sweetness or depth. I guess that's why it's a black IPA, right? I had extra-high hopes because I like Bell's, but even though it isn't my favorite, it is still better than most beer out there. I'd recommend it, but personally I think the roasty dark flavors, while lovely, conceal the hoppy citric complexity that I love so much about hops and IPAs."

I'm a fan of black IPAs and was a bit disappointed in this one. It's an above average offering, but not as roasty or piney as i prefer with a black/cascadian IPA. More sweet malt than i expected. The roasty comes out more as it warms up. The iron/stoney flavor also comes out more as it warms up. Beautiful color and lacing, however, i must say!"

Change of Heart - Black IPA 
First black IPA I’ve had the pleasure of enjoying. Fitting it is from Bells. 
Looks more that of a stout than any sort of IPA, which I assume is par for the style.
Smells somewhat grainy and faintly hoppy. Tastes almost malty upfront with a smooth hoppy taste coming afterwards. Surely an enjoyable beer, going down easily while formulating an opinion on this beer. Overall I think this is a great beer, not any kind of an expert on black IPA’s but I sure appreciated it."
1744,TristannJ31,Change of Heart Experimental Black IPA,4.19,"First time black IPA drinker, from one of my favorite breweries.

Poured into pint glass. Looks like a stout besides the 1 inch tan head it has. Smells about the same as an IPA, but a little different. Tastes like a very hoppy black ale, fairly low on the bitterness, very very smooth with a nice mouth feel. Hides the 7% alc very well. Don’t know if all blsck IPAs are this good, or if it’s just bc it’s from the “hearted” series. 

VERY good drank"
1745,chinchill,Change of Heart Experimental Black IPA,4.19,"12 oz can from a Bell's mixed 12 pack. 

I get the sense with too many Black IPAs suffer from a conflict or imbalance between grains and hops. This limited edition has no Suu h issues and has a stellar appearance to boot: black body worth a superb head that looks and last like a nitro pour. Excellent sweet/ bitter balance. 
Overall: outstanding version of the style."
1746,BeerAndGasMasks,Brin De Folie,3.53,"From the can, it pours a hazy amber color with a very nice white head that slowly reduces and leaves lacing.

1748,redresonatedragon,Voodoo Ranger Juice Force IPA,2.5,"Something is really off on this one, IMO. It is like a orange tang drink transformed into hooch by a prison convict. I can actually appreciate the aroma and even the appearance of the drink in the glass. But the abrasive quality that comes through in the taste along with the lingering sweetness, ( the high alcohol gives it a solvent quality) it might be one of the worst hazles I’ve had all year, unfortunately! But some people want to get drunk quick so it’ll do that for ya!"
1749,rodbeermunch,Voodoo Ranger Juice Force IPA,4.02,"I believe this was a birthday present maybe last year from a friend. 12 pack, it went quick. Man this last year's present was some fun, need to book that room again. 

Pours a light kinda bright yellow, cloudy, 1/3"" white head. The aroma had plenty of fruitiness to it. Checks label if there is fruit added. Good, doesn't seem to be so. They didn't really skimp on the hops, there seems to be ample amounts of Mosaic giving that berry medley fruitiness, Galaxy punches through with the pineapple. Sabro not in the nose, but mouthfeel, giving it a little kick. Strata giving a more varied strawberry like presence. Its definitely a bouquet in the nose, and subsequent tastings. 

The alternaoated base is right in the wheelhouse, neither too thick nor trubby. Really makes for a great mouthfeel. That Sabro and Chinook combo gives a bitterness and effervesence that makes for a really good mouthfeel without heavy alcohol heat. 

Its really sad what has become of Colorado, or a least Denver. Bums and gaped out transients. But at least this is still a beer that you can respect."

Color is golden and very hazy. This is a Hazy beer with a fruit forward blend of semi sweet peach, almost carbonated pineapple, semi sweet green grape and wood . The woodiness balances the fruit very well and it would appeal to many Hazy beer drinkers and is a very good brew. I prefer this beer to Voodoo Rangers Tropic Force which is too fruity .It has a clean finish and I highly recommend it."

More malt, maybe 2% more bitterness, harder to mistake for Hawaiian Punch. With that said it's still a one-dimensionally fruity, overly sweet hazy NEIPA. Gets the job done if that description doesn't chafe against your sensibilities."
1753,Athener56,Voodoo Ranger Juice Force IPA,3.66,"Very strong aroma and taste of oranges. It is very carbonated and foamy, it stays foamy and maintains lacing while you drink it.

Notes via stream of consciousness: Based on the ingredients listed on the label I'm assuming this is a weizenbier as wheat comes before barley. It's poured a cloudy amber colored body with a bit of a pinkish-brown sheen beneath an inch of white foam. The color is unusual but I have seen weizenbiers that have looked like this before. In the nose it's malty, sweetish, and wheaty backed by a light note of bubblegum. The flavor follows but with more complexity. There's some caramel-apple to it, and a bit of sweet bread dough and banana. A delicate clovey spiciness and mild acidity round it out and balance it as there's not much in the way of bitterness. It finishes sweetish and lingers for a fair amount of time. In the mouth it's medium bodied and crisp, but not nearly as crisp as most weizenbiers are. I normally expect a carbonation level of around 2.7 to 3 volumes of CO2 per liter but this is probably more around 2.4 to 2.5. The head retention wasn't that good, nor was the lacing, and I'm guessing that has a lot to do with the lower carbonation. Still, it's a decent beer if you like them sweet and malty.

1757,BeerAndGasMasks,Löwe Vom Rhein,3.75,"From the ""Lion of the Rhine"" labeled can, it pours a hazy amber color with a very large, although shorter lasting, white head that reduces to a ring. The nose gets bready and some spice and banana. The mouth gets an easy drinking wheatbier, so bready with some fruity notes."
1758,BeerAndGasMasks,La Givrée,3.86,"From the can, it pours a hazy very light yellow color with a very nice white head that slowly reduces and leaves lacing. The nose gets the white beer spiciness and light malt. The mouth follows with a bit of spiciness and light malt. Easy drinking."
1759,jlindros,Good Evening Vienna,4.33,"Thanks to Robert for this one, canned 2023/12/13

Pours a rich creamy 2 finger head with moderate retention, fair sticky lacing, very clear amber with a bit more reddish tinge color

Nose nice rich toasted bready malts, rich bread crust, toasted biscuity notes, hint of caramel sweetness, moderate herbal floral hops, very light malt-derived fruity esters a bit like pome fruit

Taste starts again with rich grainy toasted malt, a bit of cereal but more like bread crust, a touch nutty and fair biscuity bready like, mild caramel toffee sweetness but just a touch, a hint of malt-derived fruity esters as well with a bit of a plum note, moderate hops kick in with med spicy hop bitterness, a bit herbal floral as well, soft lager hard to tell if decoction but likely not, finishing drier, crisp, med-high spicy hop bitterness a bit like a Czech pils level

Mouth is med bod, soft lager, med to a bit higher carb, crisp

Overall quite nice, very well done Vienna lager, maybe a tad high on the hop level for the finish, but better than not enough hops, great balance and malt profile in general, lagered well, just a good beer"
1760,Beginner2,Good Evening Vienna,4.23,"As the 10th rating, I'm glad to bring Good Evening above BA's Score threshold. This Vienna deserves to compete with its peers. My copy appears to be the first re-release and its seems very much like the reviews before mine.

Poured into my BA Respect Beer glass, this is a very attractive amber; particularly after today's sunset, reflecting the reddish sky brilliantly through the glass and the branches outside my window have near-perfect clarity. (No blonde could make this rich a contrast.) I also give Look points for AHB's label. They are more than master lager brewers; causing me to give them equally great Overall Hugs.

Smells, Taste and Feel are less distinguished; but certainly enjoyable and well-integrated. Aromas of mostly malt and bread carry into the Tastes well; yet by mid-palate drying hops assert themselves and carry through to a satisfying finish that I'd rather didn't end. Medium-mouthed. Worth seeking again."

Smells of crusty rustic bread, toasted caramel, toast, a pinch of brown sugar and decent herbal hops. Taste adds a grain and nut combo to the base malt flavors, hop finish is more defined without being too much, toast the biggest star through the whole sip, wonderful. Feels has a great malt backbone with rustic yeast most of the sip and decent hop molding on the finish, medium bodied, easy drinking but has character. An excellent vienna"
1764,Todd,Good Evening Vienna,4.5,"16oz canned on 05/19/21. Thanks, @FBarber!

Pours deep, dark copper with brown hues and a slightly off-white head that's a solid two-fingers thick. Malty nose with dark bread crust and caramel. First sip pierces the foam, so it's quite creamy and smooth. Firm, medium-body with some chewiness. Flavor is bready, toasty, grainy, and nutty with a touch of brown sugar sweetness and toffee in the back. Light bitterness and spicy hops. Dries up quickly with some astringency, earthiness, and biscuit in the finish.

Loving this Vienna Lager from Art History! Rustic and full of flavor."
1765,FBarber,Good Evening Vienna,4.46,"This one pours a dark chestnut brown color. It has excellent clarity, brilliantly visible when held up to the light. Two to three finger off-white head forms on the beer before dissipating. Aroma has notes of dark bready malts, a hint of breadiness, no toasted or roasted notes. Some spicy hops come through with a hint of brown sugar or toffee. 

Taste largely follows from the nose with notes of dark bready malts, a slight nuttiness with hints of brown sugar giving way to a spicy hop finish. Feel is light to moderately bodied, smooth, easy drinking. Somewhat drier, particularly through the finish. 

This is a really well crafted Vienna. Hits all of the markers of the style in my mind and does so very well."

Aroma is mainly tropical style hops, mango , green grapes, papaya and peach. Really nice.
Taste similar but with a little more piney hop and an underlying ""wild"" taste. I assume from DeGarde yeast?
Mouthfeel is very very fucking good, smooth yet well carbonated. Like a dream.
An excellent weird IPA. Loved it."
1767,NickSMpls,"Hello, Buddy",4.2,"Canned Jan 4th, '23
Pours an unfiltered amber with an especially frothy head, near to overflowing our glass. Very nice citrus aroma wafts up from the head, but holds on as the head fades to lacing. Taste carries forward the citrus theme, with a hoppy first and foremost, with well-tempered bitterness. Finish is clean and fades to a hint of lemon peel. Any malt base keeps to itself. ABV rolls in at 6.4%, just about right for an IPA. it's slightly dry with good carbonation throughout. As it warms slightly, you can pick up a little more of the malt.

All around, this IPA is as good as any from the deep bench of IPAs from Ft. George and we'd put it in the leader-of-the-pack class. We are not sure on how the collaboration with De Garde Brewing plays in to this, as they are totally in another class of brewing with Wild Ales and related kinds for their entire lineup -- not a single conventional ale in their BA list of 150+ beers. Whatever, it's a fine result."
1768,DefenCorps,"Hello, Buddy",4.05,"Can from Mongers. 

A clear light orange with a dense white head with excellent retention. The nose is super dank with diesel Mosaic notes paired with an intense Strata character that borders on fresh hop like intensity. Minimal malt. The palate opens bitter, dank, herbaceous with weed, diesel, and pure Strata juice. Dripping with hop oils with intense flavor. A hair watery on the palate, holding this back. All told, lovely veer."

The nose is mild caramel malt and not much else.

Malty sweet up front, maybe a bit of toasted character in midstream. Almost zero hops. 

Creamy and smooth. Not sticky but a little heavy even for the style.

It looks and smells like a great bock. It's too heavy, malty, and unbalanced for the style, unfortunately."
1770,beergoot,Samuel Adams Winter Lager,3.44,"Ultra clear, dark copper body; excellent carbonation; fair head, thick at first then recedes to a half-finger thickness, khaki colored, semi-creamy texture. Nice yet muted aroma, primarily caramel. Interesting flavor; malty but with a strange bitterness aftertaste; mild caramel flavor; somewhat tannin-like character; woody herbaceousness. Medium body; smooth and velvety on the palate.

I wasn't overly impressed with the original version of Sam Adam's Winter Lager (earned a 3.48 BA overall score from me), and this one doesn't leave me wowed either. For a bock beer, it seems a bit weak and lifeless, and the supposed coriander, ginger and orange peel used in its creation seem AWOL.

1773,CantDrinkEveryBeer,Samuel Adams Winter Lager,3.44,"Purchased in the 2023 holiday pack. Bottle has a pretty gold and blue color scheme, but shares the same generic graphic as all the beers in the collection. Some years ago each bottle had a unique piece of artwork, and the Winter Lager was one of my favorites. Poured into a Samuel Adams Perfect Pint glass.

Look: A rich, dark maroon, opaque on the table but translucent and bright when held to the light. Slightly tan head. A small amount of bubbles rise continuously.

Smell: The weakest part of the beer. Musty with some sweetness; cedar shavings and maple sap. Not super-appetizing.

Taste: Some odd bitterness upfront, redolent of unripe nuts. Then comes some toasty, wheat malts. Finishes very sweet. Cinnamon butter, warm milk, a bit of caramel. Lingers warmly on the tongue very pleasantly, inviting another sip.

Feel: Initial carbonation is harsh and soda-like; is that where that non-hoppy bitterness comes from? After the bubbles dissipate, the body is smooth and buttery, sticking to the teeth after swallowing. Just like the taste, weak at first but finishes much better.

Overall: When I first started drinking beer this was one of my favorites. I don't know if it's the new recipe or just growing more experienced, but I definitely am not as smitten. I did still enjoy the brew and will continue the yearly tradition of getting a few cases of the holiday sampler.

Edit: After letting the beer sit and warm up and lose some of its initial carbonation, the bitterness receded and became much more like the beer I remembered. Raised the score a bit but with the caveat that you give it some time to rest before drinking. Or maybe I just got an overly fizzy batch. Cheers!"

Taste: A tangy, brightly juicy, fruity flavor of tangerine, pineapple, passion fruit and apricot. Leans a tad sweet. Underneath are some florals, more citric pith and a faint veggie hint. Bitterness is fairly slight. Warming alcohol presence. A smidgen of chalk. Pureed fruits by the bitter, the booze, the pith on the mouth-coating finish.

1784,JohnniEMc,Built To Spill,4.29,"Spilled into a clear glass liter mug, the erstwhile contents of a pint can next reside there, temporarily. The color of the brew is lemonade like, only more opaque and with a sustaining modest off-white head. The aroma is more like cold oatmeal, with a little citrus and isn't pronounced. But the taste is. This has an absolutely wonderful hoppy bite. Maybe pine and citrus augmenting each other, with a sum greater than the two parts. The mouthfeel is nicely softened by the oats, but not overly so. It drinks lightly and cleanly, but with a body that's substantial. There's not a great deal of glass lacing and as mentioned, the aroma is mild. Other than that, this is outstanding. If you like a nice clean and sharp hop bite, you'll love this one. The ABV is nicely incorporated into the overall taste and mouthfeel. It has the mouthfeel of a New England IPA, with the bite of a West Coast IPA. This is highly recommended to all that enjoy hoppy beers."
1785,dbrauneis,Built To Spill,4.28,"A: Pours a milky hazy bright pale orangish yellow in color with moderate amounts of fine active visible carbonation rising along the edges of the glass and moderate pale yellow + lemon yellow + pale honey + apricot + peach colored highlights. The beer has a three finger tall dense creamy sudsy foamy white head that slowly reduces to a medium sized patch of medium thick film covering approximately 30% of the surface of the beer surrounded by a large patch of slightly mottled thin film covering the remainder of the surface of the beer and a medium thick ring at the edges of the glass. Significant amounts of lacing are observed.

S: Moderate to strong aromas of juicy citrus/grapefruit + tropical/pineapple + citrus/tangerine + gooseberry hops over the top if light to moderate aromas of biscuit + pale + oat + wheat malts with a light amount of sugary sweetness.

T: Upfront there are light to moderate flavors of biscuit + pale + oat + wheat malts with a light amount of sugary sweetness. That is followed by moderate to strong flavors of juicy citrus/grapefruit + tropical/pineapple + citrus/tangerine + gooseberry hops which impart a hint of bitterness which fades away very quickly leaving moderate lingering citrus + tropical hop flavors.

M: Just shy of medium bodied with moderate amounts of carbonation. Slightly crisp initially with light to moderate amounts of creamy soft/fluffiness mid-body and a light amount of dryness in the finish.

O: Easy to drink with well hidden alcohol and a pleasantly soft/fluffy mouthfeel. Enjoyable citrus + tropical + gooseberry hop profile."

1789,Ozzylizard,Green City,4.27,"Green City – from Other Half Brewing. A 16 fl oz can was purchased from Franklin Beer, Franklin, PA on 08/12/23 for $ 5.00 (Including tax), $ 0.3125/fl oz. Reviewed 02/01/24 (Review 3208). Note that I use DD/MM/YY protocol.
Bottom of can stamped 09/08/2022. Stored at 34 degrees at home. Served at 47.8 degrees F in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. The final temperature was 54.5 degrees F. 
Appearance – 4
First pour – Pale Straw (SRM 2), hazy and opaque.
Body – Straw (SRM 3), opaque. Under direct light, same. Rear-lite, same.
Head: Average (Maximum four cm, aggressive center pour), white, high density with a rocky top, average retention, dropping to a 0.5 – 1.1 cm jagged crown with initial prominences of lacing.
Lacing – Excellent! Wide band of tiny to small bubbles with vault having short stalactites.
Aroma – 4.5 – Strong grapefruit. No malt, no yeast, no alcohol (7% ABV as marked on the label).
Flavor – 4.25 – Slightly sweet grapefruit quickly becoming bitter before a slightly sweet finish. No malt, no yeast. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl. Mild gastric warming. 
Palate – 4 – Full; creamy; soft but lively carbonation.
Final impression and summation: 4.25 For being a year past date, the Simcoe hops have held up well, bring a delightful grapefruit flavor and bitter/sweet/bitter taste sensation to my taste buds. I rolled this can a few times before opening to make sure I got the full effect of the haziness. Unfortunately, any peach flavors were long gone, but for what it is (an old can of beer), it’s still good."
1790,TCgenny,Green City,4.19,"Pours hazy yellow golden with a really beautiful creamy froth merengue head. Aroma of citrus peel, grapefruit . Tasting grapefruit , peachy, hint of pine. Creamy and delectable feel with a tad of smacky smacky dry in the finish. Overall a very delic ipa form our friends at OH!"
1791,Bloodbuzz99,Green City,4.51,Can from Merchants Nov 2023
1792,Whiteweasel,Green City,4.63,"Poured from a pint can into a pint glass. 

A: Really really nice looking. Thick, creamy, borderline opaque. Super hazy. Pale goldenrod, and looks just like a lemon square, with the yellow body and the dusting of white foam on top. Frothy, heterogeneous head. A rare 5 star appearance. 

S: Tropical fruits; white peach, pineapple and mango, with just the right amount of piney resinous hop character. For a moment I felt like I was smelling a Douglas Fir. Freshness and balance. 

T: Rich in tropical fruit: pineapple, peach, Meyer lemon. Lacks the drawbacks of other, inferior IPAs, like over-aggressive bitterness, cloying sweetness, or too much alcoholic bite. Falls a bit short of perfection, especially compared with the other characteristics, but still extremely enjoyable.

M: Rich mouthfeel with excellent viscosity and carbonation. Settles nicely. Lingers, but doesn’t overstay its welcome. Wonderful, and another perfect score. 

Overall: Spectacular IPA. Easily one of the best beers I’ve had, full stop. Better than any IPA I’ve had out of Portland, and goes toe to toe with Russian River’s Pliny the Elder."
1793,eppCOS,Green City,4.58,"L - Orange foam creamsicle; lace, retaining but not huge head.
S - oranges, more foam, citrus floral expression.
T - A bit more kiwi/blueberry, and almost a ... what, smarties candy impression on the palate? What just happened?
F - Good, balanced, mouthfeel but not the stand-out on this beer. 
O - My favorite of the OH beers we recently got here in Colorado, I presume, because of GABF. I like this more than AllCitraEverything"
1794,JohnniEMc,Slow Melt,4.14,"Looks good, the pour to empty a pint can's contents into a clear glass liter mug. There's a modest just-off-white head atop an only slightly cloudy, but bright and light golden-amber liquid. The head sustains. It smells like good beer, with some malt and mild hops, but there's nothing pronouncedly aromatic. That's its taste. There's some malt and there's some mild hopping. This is just nothing more than a basic American IPA. Well, it is a bit more. In an age of overly hazing, adding milk sugar, adding fruit and/or trying to get beer to taste like fruit juice and using wheat as a backbone for an IPA, this is a welcomed return to basics. It lacks a little bite and some barley malt provided body and taste layering. It's a light IPA version and that’s OK. It brings enough to be a decent representative of the style. Flat out, It's immensely drinkable and there's even some pretty stratified glass lacing to look at."
1795,FRANKHAZE,Slow Melt,4.29,"This is a phenomenal IPA. Great clean drinking here, very well made."
1796,Luscious_Malfoy,Slow Melt,4.29,"poured from a 16oz can into a narrow gauge willi becher pint glass. pours fairly golden clear with a firm two fingers of white foam head. good looking beer. sexy foam and i’m kind of glad it’s not hazy. grapefruit plus pine and honeydew on the nose. taste mostly follows with grapefruit leading the way but also get a touch of pine, honey and even like lager-style cracker biscuit malt notes. really good. crisp, clean, refreshing. barely bitter and just hoppy enough. thick, full mouthfeel. i feel like this isn’t going to do much for a true hop head but for me, the balance of malts and hops is marvelous. this seems like a terrific winter IPA but i’d drink this anytime of year. well done HA."
1797,GuyFawkes,Slow Melt,3.43,"I had this on draft 1/10/24 @ Half Acre. 

See-through dull orange/yellow appearance. 

Big khaki head; strong lacing remained. 

Dry grass & watermelon Jolly Rancher notes in the nose. 

Medium mouthfeel. 

Watermelon Jolly Rancher & dry grass flavors up front; tangy grapefruit notes on the finish. 

Too much for this timid soul, but it was ultimately drinkable."
1798,TheWaySheGoes,Slow Melt,4.12,"Gorgeous golden color, great lacing on the glass. Notes of candied fruit on the nose, same follows for the taste plus blueberry with a dry finish. A bit of shame the hops used were not mentioned anywhere on the can."
1799,jakecattleco,Slow Melt,3.96,Very bright tropical modern IPA. Restrained bitterness.
1800,zeff80,Silver Morning,3.99,"On draft at Sycamore, Columbia, MO. Poured a dark, dark brown color with a small, khaki-colored head of foam. It left minimal lacing. It smelled of roasted malt, sweet toffee and caramel. Nice roasted malt taste with some bitterness. Toffee and caramel sweetness add balance."
1801,whynot44,Silver Morning,4.13,"Clear but very dark reddish amber color with a respectable and lasting tan head with some nice lacing. 
The aroma is toasted malt, pumpernickel bread, raisins, caramel and brown sugar/molasses. 
The taste is along the same lines with possibly a little more fruit - plums, black cherries as well as raisins, mildly sweet. The finish dries out with some herbal hops and a bit of white pepper. 
The body is light/medium, decent level of carbonation, almost oily smooth and very drinkable. Altogether, this is a tasty and enjoyable brew, very nice, I would not mind having this again."
1802,Brutaltruth,Silver Morning,4.04,"From the 16 oz can in a snifter. This nice doppel pours a nice
dark brown mahogany with a decent head of khaki foam that settles 
to a thin ring, thin dusty layer, and sports some faint lacing. Nose 
of toasted malts, brown sugars, dark bread, and subtle dark fruits. 
Flavors hit the mark with dark breaded malts, toffee, brown sugars,
raisin, dark cherry, and nicely placed herbal hops. Mouthfeel 
is medium, medium light carbonation, smooth, rich, lightly
warming, and finishing nicely balanced and subtly dry.

Overall, a very nice doppelbock

Cheers"
1803,NeutroMan,Silver Morning,4.1,16 oz can into a tulip. Dark reddish-purple-ruby tinged color with a foamy tan head. Bready malt nose with some dark stone fruit and brown sugar. Sweet dark malt carries through in the flavor complemented with some peppery bitterness. Medium-bodied; very smooth.
1804,GuyFawkes,Silver Morning,3.94,"Canned 11/22/22; drank 1/4/23 @ the Yarchives. 

Mostly see-through brown/purple appearance. 

A rough pour yielded a big tan head; frothy, tree-rung lace. 

Mild notes of cream soda & oak notes in the nose. 

Brown sugar, root beer & faint mint flavors. 

Light on the nose, but pretty flavorful on the palate. I'd have another!"
1805,Franziskaner,Silver Morning,3.84,Dark brown to amber in color with a fingernail of brown around the rim and covering three quarters of the top. The aroma is of caramel and dark malt. I’m tasting tasting caramel and toffee. The mouth is crisp and refreshing.
1806,emerge077,Silver Morning,4.25,"Dark reddish auburn, ruby glint in the light. Ample tan foam and lace. Aroma is mellow, light malt sweetness and roast, malt complexity and mild coffee. Smooth taste, malt forward, light roast and dark fruit, tiny hint of alcohol. Very mild peppery, earthy hop bitterness in the finish. Medium bodied, light carbonic bite, very smooth and round feel. No detectable spices, odd claim. Nice doppelbock, enjoyed it quite a bit."
1807,WoodBrew,Silver Morning,4.21,"I am trying this beer off the tapper at Rare Chophouse in Mount Vernon, Illinois. It poured a clear dark mahogany amber with off white head that is leaving some lace. The scent had rich dark bread malt notes with hints of dark chocolate. The taste was nicely balanced and easy to drink with common bock malt base supported by chocolate and molasses flare. The creamy mouthfeel was medium in body and had good carbonation. Overall it is a solid beer."
1808,MNJR,Silver Morning,3.27,"Not a good example of a ""dopplebock."" This is not true to style. What you get is more like a winter warmer. Heavy spice flavors: cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, ginger. Some fruit: raisin, prune, some kind of rind. Thinnish feel with coarse carbonation. Have to say I'm disappointed in this. If they labelled it for what it is and set that expectation then it might not be too bad - as a holiday beer or winter warmer - but this is no bock, and bears no resemblance to a dopplebock, other than the color and appearance."
1809,BEERMILER12,Silver Morning,4.13,"A: Pours a dark brown color with 2 fingers of head that fades down to a thin cap that leaves decent lacing

S: Toasted malt, caramel, dark fruit, molasses, toffee, and some grainy/husky tones

T: Follows the nose. Starts off with a mix of toasted malt, husky grain, toffee, and caramel. Picks up some lighter molasses and dark fruit. Some lightly bitter earthy hops present as well. Finishes with lingering toasted malt and toffee

M: Medium-full bodied with moderate carbonation

O: A super solid winter lager/doppelbock that makes for a nice sipper. Definitely on the complex side lager-wise. Worth checking out"
1810,Newbeergeek1,Indulge Me,4.34,"Pours darker than the ace of spades, almost no head and not much lacing. Wild ABV at 14.9 but to Prairie’s credit they cover a strong ABV with tastes that reasonably cover it. Might be a little to chocolate in it for me but not by much. This beer is up to their standards of stouts and I would but more. Also LOVE their labels"
1811,Powderhornphil,Indulge Me,4.5,"Black as night with a thin mocha head. 

Sweet coconut. Bitter dark chocolate. Vanilla and boozy bourbon notes. Caramel sauce.

Very nice pastry stout."
1812,clayrock81,Indulge Me,4,"Poured a black body with minimal khaki head that left almost no lace. Aroma is like chocolate coconut bar (thinking like a candy bar) with hints of booze and wood as well. Smooth, the coconut aspect makes the beer slick like coconut milk and then this is balanced with a dry yet sweet burnt chocolate sweetness (which has touches of booze) that feels like slightly dry chocolate cake mix (I should not that I am not a huge chocolate cake fan). Perhaps only complaint is that I found the booze took over this beer as it warmed (and I slowly sipped on it) and started to overpower the other aspects of beer."
1813,pathman,Indulge Me,4.75,01/01/24 bottle @ home
1814,Luscious_Malfoy,Indulge Me,4.4,"poured from a 12oz bottle into a TG DBA tumbler. pours a fairly thick and shiny black with just a little less than a finger of mocha brown foam. bourbon barrel, coconut, faint vanilla frosting and some chocolate on the nose. as it warms up i do get an aroma and flavor of yellow birthday cake. in addition to the yellow cake i get chocolate, vanilla and bourbon on the taste. not really getting the coconut in the taste. sweet from the cake mix but the bourbon barrels cut it fairly well. full mouthfeel. definitely on the sweeter side but this was damn tasty."
1815,Roguer,Indulge Me,4.4,"Very nice head production, especially considering the ABV, barrel treatment, and additives. Retention, however, is lacking. Still, for such a big flavored stout, it looks excellent.

Aroma is delectable, and implies tons of bourbon and chocolate.

Flavor follows. It's hot; this is not a beer that hides the ABV, but it's still very drinkable. Absolutely decadent, rich, and delicious. On the sweeter side, but far from cloying; it's more like a rich chocolate cake than it's like a sugary treat.

Another absolutely fantastic BA flavored stout from Prairie."
1816,jngls,Indulge Me,4.42,"2 years old. Bottle to tumbler.

Look: Pitch black in color. Thin fast-fading foam.

Smell: Strong bourbon notes. Vanilla up front. Sweet milk chocolate in the background. Also coconut.

Taste: Chocolate cake sweetness with an underlying booziness and hints of coconut and vanilla. Bourbon barrel clearly detectable. 

Feel: Full and sticky. Somewhere between oily and creamy.

Overall: Very nice BA stout with the typical boozy bourbon notes. All adjuncts are present and well balanced in a classic combination with the cake batter sticking out a bit. Drinks like a liquid dessert."
1817,AElfwine_Nerevar,Miller High Life,3.3,"Tallboy BB: May 2024

L: Pours a pale straw color with excellent clarity. The pour gives two fingers of fine, white head with a bit of legs. As the beer goes down it actually leaves a good bit of lacing on the glass. It's actually a pretty good looking beer.

S: Corn grist, hint of grain, and very light hop character.

T: It's an American adjunct lager. Pretty close to the nose. Corn, light graininess, and a barely there nondescript hop character.

F: Light body with medium plus carbonation. Mouthfeel is a bit smooth with a very light dryness on the finish.

O: Pretty ok. Not a drain pour. If this is all you have then go for it."

1819,ClinkClankBeerTank,Miller High Life,3.46,"Not perfect, but what macro is, better yet, what cheap macro is? Applying IPA standards to a lawnmower shows a deep lack of appreciation for imperfection.. Miller High Life is imperfection at the highest level...no real standards, just lawnmower appeal. 
Who cares about mouthfeel when it's chugged? What's the value of smell when it's crack the top and chug? What's the value of taste when it's so cold it feels like someone jammed an icepick in your forehead?
Good for Gramps, good for Pops, good for me. 
Save your micro judgement for a micro...this ain't it."
1820,Mardinae,Miller High Life,2.9,Beer
1821,John_M,Miller High Life,2.14,"Recently sampled during a blind tasting of various AAL macro swill. Poured from a 16 ounce can into a 20 ounce wine glass (about half the can). 

The beer pours a solid golden amber color with fair at best lacing and pretty decent lacing. Visually, there wasn't much difference in appearance between this beer and the Coors I tried before it, except the MHL had slightly better head retention and lacing. On the nose, I thought the aroma profile a bit odd. While I picked up the expected sweet corn and light pepper, I also got a hint of lavender initially (glasses were all well rinsed and cleaned, and I didn't pick this aroma component up in any of the other AALs I sampled). That aroma seemed to fade as the beer sat in the glass and I didn't pick up any lavender on the palate. As for the flavor profile, this beer was a bit sweeter than the other AALs I tried during the tasting (Coors, PBR and Bud), with more sweet corn on the palate. However, the most pronounced flavor component was once again a seltzer water like aspect that seemed to dominate the finish. There was very little bitterness on the finish, and this really came across as a one dimensionally flavored beer. Otherwise, the finish really drops off with a thud in this lightweight beer. Mouthfeel is light, with a short, sweet creamed corn finish. Alcohol is undetectable, but I still wouldn't call this beer very drinkable. 

Again, if this was the only beer on the market, I would stop drinking beer. This is a very bland, boring and insipid drink."
1822,vette2006c5r,Miller High Life,2.76,"Miller High Life pours a very clean, pale yellow with a fizzy head that goes right away. The aroma is sweet used corn water. The flavor is sweeter, but overall, just neutral, with very little going on. Fizzy feel. Overall, it's a very natural beer, not good, not bad."
1823,Athener56,Miller High Life,3.36,"Faint aroma of sweet corn. Ice cold out of 16oz can it is refreshing and crisp. taste follows the smell, it is sweet and has a corn taste. light mouthfeel. overall not bad for a adjunct lager."
1824,Danimal522,Miller High Life,2.97,"After pouring this beer it’s easy to understand why it’s known as the champagne of beers, there is a ton of carbonation that will form a thick head that lasts for much longer than most other American adjunct. Stronger in scent as well I find the aroma to be of sweet corn with maybe a touch of grass clippings, but that could just be the result of which activity this beer is best enjoyed after doing. As for taste, corn also dominates with only the slightest hint of acidity. The beer finishes clean but can easily leave you bloated thanks to the high carbonation. We all know this beer won’t be winning any best of show awards but it can always be counted on to be cheap, available, and refreshing."
1825,Philosophy223,Miller High Life,2.28,tastes like burnt popcorn tbh
1826,James_Gravelle,Miller High Life,4.03,"I know people say that this beer is a cheap American beer or something. That's a popular beer. So to say, unlike Miller light or MGD, this beer is actually pretty good after drinking a few pilsner's from Europe.

This one actually has a pretty good taste.

For a cheap beer I would give it a 4 and 1/2.

I tried many different domestic beers and I have to say this is one of the best.

I do not drink it out of a can. I will put it in a glass.

Ice ice cold.

And is a very refreshing middle beer.
Pairs well with everything.

Don't knock it until you've tried it and actually try a couple.

In a glass or in a bottle ice cold not out of a can."
1827,randyw41,Miller High Life,3.88,"I'm 64 years old, but I have been drinking this since my late teen years. Always consistent in flavor and appearance, when served ice cold, it continues to be in my top 5 favorite lagers. The price is usually pretty friendly too..."
1828,Dylan184183,Miller High Life,3.25,A good cheap lager style beer. I swear the bottle version is 100x better. I find it somewhat acidic though.
1829,nasal,Two Hearted IPA,4.28,"I've always been so swayed by the brook trout on the can. I just love the fish, okay? Women love me & fish fear me. No, sorry, that's not true. I'm a woman. I just like fish. Did you know that trout have two hearts? Anyway. I like it better than most beers. There's nothing going on in the nose. However, the taste is a pleasant and balanced bitterness with enough malt to provide the necessary depth. It's not overly bitter for the sake of making a point; it just tastes good. I would happily drink this any day. Not sure whether I prefer this, which showcases the bitterness of hops and has a ""natural"" smell, or Bell's Cold Hearted, which showcases the green, herbaceous, pine-y hops flavor with that strange green apple-y note. Both are just really solid beers at their price point. I've had Bell's Two Hearted more times than I can count, so it's hard to review. Try it. Do it for the fish."

1831,Danmooney40,Two Hearted IPA,4.43,"This is one of my favorites. OG WC taste and feel to it . Good complex taste profile showcasing hoppy bitterness without being jarring. 

Also widespread distribution and availability makes me gravitate towards it even more."
1832,mcgiants,Two Hearted IPA,4.27,"This one is sort of the Beer Advocate OG for me. Someone told me it was rated #1 before I had any idea what BA was.... fairly long time ago and a lot of beers have come & gone since. I have relatives in Michigan and was on this one early, but this one is pretty well distributed now where anyone can get it anytime.

12 oz bottle poured into an Angler's Pint. Color is a nice orange, copper. Beautiful, foamy head. Taste is hop forward with a bitter follow. Nice lacing as I drink it. Very smooth and very well done."
1833,KP7,Two Hearted IPA,4.16,"Pours deep gold with moderate clarity. Nice amount of pine and grapefruit aroma. A good amount of malt characteristics balance the hop bitterness. I'm usually not a fan of IPAs but this isn't bad, not bad at all."

Rich, chocolate-like flavor; bitter with a cocoa sweetness softening things. Medium-heavy body; smooth and lightly silky.

An enjoyable oatmeal stout, rich and soothing on the palate.

Pouring temperature: 43 °F; canning info: ?3/13/23
Source: local purchase"
1841,teromous,Backmasking,3.03,"From the bottom of the can: ""PKGD 07/29/23 Q0947""

Appearance: It is a black-bodied beer with a very large khaki head. The head is pretty huge despite trying to pour the beer carefully. The texture of the head is both creamy and lumpy with various sized bubbles. It stands for a long time with great retention and it leaves excellent sheets of lacing on the glass.

Aroma: The beer has an odd floral aroma which smells a lot like potpourri. It is a nice smelling beer but it's just a bit strange. It's hard to place the aroma exactly but there are incense sticks that smell just like this.

Taste: There is a strange candy sweetness up front. A bit of a retronasal perfume character that comes across as the aroma and flavor of patchouli. A bit of a cola flavor comes through towards the middle with a light bit of char. A hint of cocoa to the back of the palate.

Mouthfeel: It feels light bodied and a bit thin. It has a medium bitterness which comes across as both an herbal bitterness and a charred bitterness. The beer is a bit difficult to drink given some of the awkward characters of the beer.

Overall: It's a weird beer that is too perfume-like. The herbal and floral aromas and flavors that the beer has are prominent but they just don't seem to work with the charred flavor of the beer. The body also feels too thin. As a whole it's a pass. I wouldn't buy it again or recommend it."

1848,jadpsu,All Night IPA,4.17,"LOOK: Pours a totally dark brown, that light dosn't pass through with a light brown head that has superior retention and plenty of side glass lace.
AROMA: Alot of heavy malts, bakers chocolate, cocoa, burnt brown sugar, caramel.
TASTE: Moderate pine and herbal hop upfront. Molasses and brown sugar, and roasted malts. 
I always have been a fan of brown ales with their roasty malts but have not had many black IPA's. Hop presence and hop bitterness certainly IMO take a back seat to the malts in this IPA.
Regardess of style, I enjoyed this brew."
1849,CHickman,All Night IPA,3.93,"This was nice and roasty with piney hops, smoked malts, grapefruit, biscuit, orange peel, tangerine and dry hop notes.

1850,allengarvin,All Night IPA,4.31,"Been a few years since I've seen a black IPA. 

This one pours very dark: not jet black, but holding up to the light I see little but brown. It has a dense head, over a cm tall. The nose offers a rich caramel scent: hops are behind it, but you have to look for them. Very pleasant malt aroma, though! Very nice taste. I don't know if it really hits the black IPA style on: bitterness is high, but hop flavor is not really to be found. It has some good roast notes that weren't present in the nose. Personally, I'd guess it as more of an American stout than a BIPA. But regardless, it's good!"

1852,MrOH,Age Of Otters,3.65,"Slightly hazy orange-gold, dense white head, great retention, rings of lace
Mango, pineapple, and a hint of coconut aroma
Big tropical flavor, tastes like it smells, sweet but not sticky
Medium bodied and appropriately carbonated
Lowest common denominator beer"
1853,whitro17,Celebration IPA,4.52,"Look - deep amber, creamy head, excellent lacing 
Smell - pine resin, tangerine
Taste - piney, tangerine, resinous
Feel - med body, well carbonated, pleasant bitterness
Overall - Bought a boat load of Celebration and have been hammering them down for a few months. Enjoying my last one before the Big Game. This one was canned on 10/27/23 and it still kicks ass. Nice bitterness in this year's batch. Just so damn good. Pairs well with Tornado of Souls by Megadeth."
1854,GaryPro,Celebration IPA,2.85,"Doing my weekend search for untested beers, I was excited to find Sierra Nevada's Celebration Fresh HOP IPA. Don't get me wrong; any beer with taste and hops makes me happy! But to my tastes on this cold and windy day in central Wisconsin, this beer was nothing special. I didn't detect much citrus or pine.
I will try again to see if the second time is a charm, but no raves from me."
1855,asouth12,Celebration IPA,4.22,"The color is a deep, rusty amber. A Small white head on the pour with some lacing. Tasting notes are hop forward pine with some caramel and spices. A solid beer for the cold weather."
1856,jonphisher,Celebration IPA,4.54,"Rusty amber, cloudy clear; slightly off white head, great retention and lacing. 

Rose forward nose, sappy bite with some orange skin; caramelized and lightly browned malt. 

Nice malt presence, lightly sweet with some toasty quality; hops are very present; pine needle and some grapefruit bite. 

Medium body, lively but very smooth carbonation, big bitter and clean bite on the finish; each aspect enhancing the other, a thing of beauty."
1857,KP7,Celebration IPA,3.96,"Pours an amber/orange with a two-finger off-white head that lingers a bit and leaves a thick coating.

Big hop aromas are obvious from the start with pine preeminent along with floral and earthy notes. There is also a surprising (to me) amount of malt sweetness coming through.

The taste is far more balanced than I expected, though it does still lean more bitter than I prefer. Malt sweetness comes through first as brown bread with honey and slight caramel, then the hops make themselves known with a piney, resinous bitterness. There's a slight citrus character as well, but for me it is overwhelmed by the lingering pine throughout a bitter finish and aftertaste. As it warms, a caramel sweetness comes through near the finish to lend a foil to all that pine bitterness. 

Medium-light bodied with some soft carb that results in a pleasant feel.

Overall, this is more enjoyable than I expected and I can see why those who love WCIPAs rave about this beer every fall. It might not make it into my regular rotation, but I definitely won't shy away from it again."
1858,TwentyDimes,Celebration IPA,4.21,"Canned Oct 12.
Clear amber, thick creamy foam slowly reduced to thin and stays, lace coating and lingered to the end.
Citrus, malty, touch of sweet dried fruit and forest pine nose with hint of floral tone, quite engaging.
Nose follows to palate with excellent hop/malt balance, moderately long rich malty finish with serious mouth coating hoppy pine.
Medium body, excellent weight and carbonation, no hop burn.
A classic for many reasons, a beautiful beer to look at, smell, and taste. The 2023 version seems less intense than 2022's, but a touch more balanced and refined."
1859,crazyspicychef,Celebration IPA,4.6,"A yearly tradition.
Beautiful red ale with an in your face hop smack.
Very citrus and evergreen prominent aroma but also a hefty malt backbone to somewhat balance everything out.
Overall a great West Coast Red IPA."
1860,Whyteboar,Celebration IPA,4.18,"Not sure why I waited so long to try this as it’s been praised annually for as long as I can remember.
The appearance isn’t anything special, and the aroma is lost on me as Covid took my sense of smell.
The taste though, it’s pretty much everything I want in an IPA, apparently west coast style is what I prefer in that regard.
The feel is just right for the style, eminently quaffable.
Definitely will have it again next year, but next time I’ll get it as soon as I see it."
1861,DuaneL,Celebration IPA,4.25,This is a very nice malt – forward IPA that is great at Christmas time!
1862,DoctorZombies,Maple Bourbon Barrel Paradise,4.13,"Bottled 11/1/23. Poured at 54°. Fizzy dark tan head with a few rocks; cap dissolved quickly leaving small islands of micro dots, a thin ring and flecks of coconut; small spots of lace on agitation; no legs; dark brown body with ruby edges. Nose is chocolate and maple; no maple or coconut. Entry is sweet maple sugar candy and chocolate; some coconut; a little vanilla as beer warms, but could not find bourbon. Full minus body; smooth viscous/adjuncty feel; some mouth warmth from 14.3% abv; light carbonation. Overall, very sweet; base plus maple sugar mainly; very little coconut and vanilla; no bourbon."
1863,Beersnake,Maple Bourbon Barrel Paradise,4.49,"Poured at fridge temp. Pours a really thick black with minimal brown head. The nose is incredible. Maple, vanilla, chocolate, bourbon, figs, and prunes. Super smooth.

The taste is insane. Tons of maple, brown sugar, vanilla, slight coconut, rich chocolate truffle, a touch of bourbon, raisins, marshmallow, slightly burnt caramel, prunes, and dark bread. Lovely.

The mouthfeel is thick and creamy. The aftertaste is sweet toffee. What a wonderful creation."
1864,MJSFS,Maple Bourbon Barrel Paradise,3.97,"Molasses water is the best description I can come up with for this beer. It’s very thin, with little to no carbonation, and the maple sweetness overpowers everything. The aroma is really good, but unfortunately it’s the best quality of this brew.

Prairie consistently puts flat stouts into the market. Apparently they are against beers that pour and sustain a head of foam."
1865,Brutaltruth,Maple Bourbon Barrel Paradise,4.43,"From the 12 oz bottle in a snifter. This solid little brew pours a 
pitch black with a moderate head of tan foam that sizzles to a thin ring
but sports some nice legs. Nose of subtle bourbon, maple, vanilla
cream, and dark chocolate amongst waves of dark roasted goodness.
Flavors nail it! Dark chocolate dances about bourbon, vanilla cream, 
brulee, moderate char, deep roast, and dark berry notes of blackberry 
and blueberry. Dark brown sugars also show up with warmth as does
dark coffee and rich maple notes. Mouth feel is full, smooth, rich, caoting,
slick, light carbonation, and a sweet finish.

Overall, another winner from a great brewery that does the sweeter brew styles
with class without being overly cloying!

Cheers"
1866,Luscious_Malfoy,Maple Bourbon Barrel Paradise,4.71,"poured from a 12oz bottle into a TG DBA tumbler. pours a shiny black with a thin dark brown foam cap that quickly fades away. aromas of rich chocolate, sweet coconut and vanilla, caramel and bourbon. not sure i get maple but damn the nose on this is incredible. taste mostly follows. i get more maple in the taste than the nose but it’s hardly prominent. i can’t put my finger on what the combination of maple, bourbon, coconut and vanilla reminds me of but its almost got like a german chocolate cake thing going on. thick mouthfeel. this was excellent. wish i had another."

1868,Mr_Brown,Trappist Tripel,4.09,"hazy gold, thin foam
smell of apples, cider, sugars, some pines. 
starts very dry for 9.5% alc, finishes with lingering sweetness.
Feels similar to cider or natural wine, hazy and dry, but with sweetness
O: a great triple, starts dry and finishes sweet. Lacks some funkiness in taste compared to triple karmeliet from Bosteels. Natural-wine-like feeling is what I love about it."
1869,UWDAWG,Trappist Tripel,4.13,"Poured from a 330ml bottle with a bottled on date of 2-21-22 and a best by date of 2-21-24 into a teku glass at 52 degrees.

Look- Pale gold, moderately hazy, plentiful large visible particulate, white sudsy head, above average head retention, average lacing.

Smell- Ripe banana, floral, apple, medium strength of scent.

Taste- Ripe banana, apple, black pepper, clove, grassy malt character, mildly sweet, medium strength of flavor.

Feel- Medium body, average carbonation, moderately bitter, highly creamy, mildly sweet, moderately dry finish.

Overall- Not a style that I tend to drink, but this beer is regarded as one of the best of it’s kind. I like to be introduced to new styles in this fashion so I can be assured I’m giving myself the best possible chance of properly assessing the style. That being said, this beer provided a new and interesting drinking experience that was pleasant and enjoyable."
1870,nasal,Trappist Tripel,4.4,"Hot, high abv flavor. Love it, but would need to try it side by side with my other favorite tripels to know if I prefer this funkier tripel over a sweeter tripel like Fin du Monde."
1871,txaudiophile,Trappist Tripel,3.77,"High quality Tripel but not my favorite. A little thinner in body and more bitter than I like, but it is still highly enjoyable, and you would never know the ABV is this high. A trappist masterpiece, just not the best for me."
1872,MadMadMike,Trappist Tripel,4.29,"33 cl bottle poured chilled into a taster’s snifter. 9.5% ABV. Brewed within the abbey walls. Bottled 24/08/2023, best by 24/08/2025. 
Great dense foam pops up over intense gold brew, withdraws to sponge, leaves fair lace.
Aroma is lemon, lychee, touch of honey.
Taste follows, with banana and black pepper in tow. Hop and caramel malt play well together. Not as sweet as many tripels can be. Dry, tingly, peppery, long finish.
Mouthfeel is medium with prickly carbonation.
Overall, lighter than most, better than a few."
1873,Sparty1224,Black Sun,4.24,"Brief Review:

O: Looks like this beer has actually been around a while, surprised I've never had it. Looks like a re-brew, first since 2016 maybe? Interesting beer here, says it's an Irish Dry Stout? Very hoppy on the nose and finish, almost like a Black IPA. Not sure roasty or thick. My first impression wasn't very strong, but now knowing what style they're going for, I guess it's pretty decent. 

Recommendation: Interesting style you don't see much anymore, so if you're curious for an Irish dry stout with an extra hoppy twist, I say go for it."
1874,Stooven,Black Sun,3.77,"There's a poetic symmetry to how so many of those mid-period FFF beers (Space Station, LazerSnake, etc) all tasted about the same. . . that Black Sun tastes exactly like how the brain remembers other FFF stouts. If you like those hoppy stout bastages, you'll like this one."
1875,MrOH,Black Sun,4.29,"Very dark brown, not quite black, big tan head, great retention, rings of lace
Roast, coffee, slight herbal (tobacco and mint) aroma
Cold coffee, herbal flavor
Medium-light bodied, appropriately carbonated, very drinkable for the ABV
I like it"
1876,Tsar_Riga,Black Sun,4.11,"Dark, opaque body with splashy head and lacing, dry roasted malt nose. The open is toast, dry chocolate, coffee in the middle, and a very dry close. Superb stout."
1877,Luscious_Malfoy,10 Year Barleywine,4.93,"poured from a gold-waxed 750mL bottle into a SP stemmed bulb glass. pours thick and dark brown with the faintest dark brown foam bubbles that are quick to fade away. huge bourbon up front on the nose as well as caramel, toffee, light chocolate and vanilla, and even a hint of leather and dark fruit. the barrel is insane on this thing. taste pretty much follows with toffee/caramel soaked in bourbon up front followed by oak, chocolate, vanilla and just the slightest hint of dark fruits. huge mouthfeel. insanely thick. i assume this isn’t bottled still but it’s damn near there. this is like a damn near perfect barleywine. rich, luxurious, bourbon-forward and monstrous yet balanced and drinkable. it’s a sipper for sure but man is it good. wow."
1878,lucius10,10 Year Barleywine,4.72,"Sweet milk chocolate and caramel candy malty, chocolate covered raisins, a hint of rye spice, and a balanced bourbon barrel nose on this one! Taste follows exactly with some well-integrated bourbon barrel heat on the finish! As it warms, that barrel heat starts to make itself more present...but, it is not overpowering or overwhelming in any way. This is a world-class barleywine! The only thing that is keeping this from being an all-timer for me is that I needed the mouthfeel to be a touch heavier on the palate...especially as it warmed. The mouthfeel is great, but it leaned more full/soft than heavy/decadent IMO. Great stuff!"
1879,WickedBeer,10 Year Barleywine,4.99,"Absolute banger. Similar but with more noticeable barrel integration than MJK. Caramel chews, Raisinet candy, hints of Bordeaux cherry. Time and temp bring bourbon-soaked oak staves. Finishes long, warm, and mildly dry."
1880,Dicers,10 Year Barleywine,5,"L: Jet black and very viscous
S: Dark fruits, brown sugar
T: Dark fruit, molasses, with booze present but not overpowering throughout
F: Heavy on the tongue
O: Top 3 barleywines to come out of SP"
1881,edthehead,Double Barrel Anabasis - 10 Year,5,"Black oily appearance with a faint faint collar of tan head. Bold bourbon notes complimented by an array of molasses, raisin, fig, and brown sugar notes. Thick and silky! Beautiful!"
1882,WickedBeer,Double Barrel Anabasis - 10 Year,4.83,"Fresh oak, burnt caramel, & a hint of smoke on the nose. Palate brings heavy barrel but it’s never overbearing; notes of baking chocolate, neat bourbon, raisin, & Werther’s caramels w/ a mild lingering hop bitterness. Long, warm, mildly dry finish."
1883,drdiesel9483,Double Barrel Anabasis - 10 Year,4.92,"Look - dark haze black brown very slight rim and lacing
Smell - so much char barrel, booze, dark malts, tobacco, dark dried fruit
Taste - basically the same fantastic
Feel - thick slight syrup lighter carb
Overall - probably the best barley wine yet!"
1884,Luscious_Malfoy,Double Barrel Anabasis - 10 Year,4.69,"poured from a gold-waxed 375mL bottle into a SP BBT22 snifter. pours brown but gathers in the glass a darker, more menacing brown with a dark khaki colored thin, crackling foam head that reduces down to nothing but a few swirls here and there. heavy bourbon, dark fruits and toffee on the nose but it’s hard to detect much but straight bourbon even at room temperature. taste offers a bit more depth than the nose with bourbon, oak, leather, toffee, caramel and raisins. it’s really good. a slow sipper to be sure. everything about it is soaked in booze. thick, full mouthfeel. sits heavy on the tongue and in the finish. bourbon sting on the finish. i think i like this better than DBA 2020. that or i just wasn’t ready for DBA 2020. either way, this one hits hard. the barrel is the star, the connecting line, the common theme, etc.. but it doesn’t get old or played. instead, it adds layers of complexity to an already complex (and great) barleywine."
1885,REVZEB,V.S.O. Gravedigger,4.59,"Medium brown body with a large beige head. Aromas of molasses, bourbon, caramel malts, slight earth, some dark wood and date. Taste adds some sassafras, dried cherries and mild yeast. Feel has plenty of smooth malt and barrel character, but the yeast in combination with high carb create an elevated finish with a little snarl. This is a unique new world barrel treatment meeting an old world style and it working beautifully. The wife liked it"
1886,mschrei,V.S.O. Gravedigger,4.6,"I understand how this is the number one Scotch ale, as it really ticks all the boxes. It’s strong with the barrel, it’s got the dark fruit and caramel notes, and it’s the perfect balance of sweet and boozy. Excellent!"
1887,Roguer,V.S.O. Gravedigger,4.24,"Good head production; retention is poor, although that's to be expected.

Aroma is massive and impressive, giving off strong impressions of whiskey, oak, caramel, honeycomb, and brown sugar. Lesser notes of chocolate, dark fruit, nuts, and coffee.

Very similar on the palate, albeit less impressive overall. Nothing is remotely off, but the whole may not be greater than the sum of its parts. On the plus side, those individual parts are pretty great on their own. Tasting notes are similar to the nose, with bourbon definitely leading the way. Quite hot on the palate - again, expected, but noteworthy."
1888,Franziskaner,V.S.O. Gravedigger,4.15,"Black in color with no light penetration. No discernible head. There’s a wallop of sweet malt, vanilla, and bourbon. I’m tasting a lot of sweet malt, bourbon, and vanilla. The mouth is sticky, chewy, boozy."
1889,stevoj,V.S.O. Gravedigger,4.41,"12oz can from Tavour. Dark brown pour, still. Aroma is sweet and malty, raisins, bourbon. Taste is sweet, light peated malts, prunes, tobacco, molasses, whiskey and can initial blast of warmth. Smooth, sweet, slick, with a touch of dryness at the finish."
1890,Luscious_Malfoy,V.S.O. Gravedigger,4.46,"poured from a 12oz can into a revolution deep woods tumbler. pours a chestnut brown but gathers in the glass nearly black with almost two fingers of sandy brown foam. always crazy to me how much head these rev deep woods cans throw. the foam is quick to fade into nothing leaving this looking like a dark barleywine. aromas of bourbon, oak, molasses and caramel. get a little wet cardboard and leather as it warms. taste mostly follows. it’s as massive as it is drinkable, which is quite impressive. it’s the perfect fall or winter strong ale. it’s like a mix of a barleywine and a winter ale on steroids aged in bourbon barrels that are also on steroids. medium-full mouthfeel. certainly nowhere near thin but also carbonated enough to give it some zip. this was really good. very ambitious as this was always going to be an outcast in the VSO (pricier) lineup."
1891,mothman,V.S.O. Gravedigger,4.5,"Can. 2023z Tan head that fades. Dark brown color.

Figs, plums, caramel, toffee, vanilla, baker’s chocolate, raisins/grapes, oak, lots of whiskey and rye. Maple and char. Warming. Strong but smooth. Lots going on here. Very complex. Smokey, fudge coconut bourbon finish.

Fantastic scotch ale."
1892,stortore,V.S.O. Gravedigger,4.55,"12 ounce can into a snifter. Canned 4/4/23, had 8/27/23. Also had on tap at April release.

Pours a ruby brown color, semi opaque, with a half inch foamy head and light foamy lacing. Aromas of bourbon, caramel, figs, rye, malt, dates, some vanilla and oak. Smells slightly smoky. Flavors of bourbon, figs, rye, caramel, malt, dates, leather, vanilla, some oak and brown sugar. Smooth, semi dry, a very good medium body, well carbonated. 

Excellent. Has a big barrel presence overall, and the spicy and bold rye barrels add a lot of character. Has an array of distinct and expressive aromas and flavors. This is a top level Deep Wood entry- which says a lot."
1893,REVZEB,For Cory,4.62,"Matte pitch black pour, no head save a dark brown ring. So this is an angry ADWTD blend, daring to show off the depth and potency of both the barrels and the underlying ales. Nose captures the blended barrels, cognac in particular shines through the waves of bourbon, with huge dark fruit, molasses, barley, and cocoa, it is barrel candy. Taste focuses on dark fruit, molasses, raisin, caramel, prune, vanillin, and barley, all set in rich barrels, again it is barrel candy. Feel is warm, rich, smooth, heavy, sticky, chewy, and shaped by rich barrels. This is an amazing strong ale"
1894,drdiesel9483,For Cory,4.81,"Look - Black thick syrup with slight rimming and nice lacing
Smell and taste - so much barrel followed by brown sguar, raisin, prune and booze. The taste is a step above the smell!
Feel - full body light crisp carb
OVerall - Just incredible!!!"
1895,lucius10,For Cory,4.63,"Sweet caramel and molasses malty, chocolate covered raisiny dark fruits, hint of rye spice, and a vanilla-bourbon barrel nose on this one! Taste follows with some chocolate covered caramel upfront...and then a prominent, bourbon boozy heat finish. As it warms and opens up, a little more boozy heat starts to creep out on the backend. This is great!"
1896,maximum12,For Cory,4.85,"Considering my name is on this bottle, you’d think Anchorage would’ve tossed a few my way. 375ML, pink wax. Thick pink wax. 

Since I’m color blind (I can’t tell really dark brown from light black – or gray, as my wife tells me) I am unable to verify the color. The head is fizzy & lives the life of sickly mayfly. The nose is bursting with bourbon.

For Cory is decadent. Rich beyond the meaning of the word, there is some Bag of Holding (Bottle?) warping of reality to allow so many malts in so tiny a bottle. The barrels come swarming like tasty locusts: mostly bourbon, with a spittle of rye spiciness. Molasses, layers of oak, booze that I can’t taste but can surely feel. Thick. Luscious.

This blast reached the upper deck, maybe the third deck. More alcohol doesn’t always translate to better beer, but this, well, wow. Top-flight experience."
1897,Roguer,For Cory,4.7,"Remarkably good head production from a strong pour, all things considered. Decent retention, although before long it's mostly faded to a thin brown ring atop a very dark black body.

Oh, the nose. THE NOSE. So much bourbon and oak, along with notes of chocolate, molasses, toffee, caramel, red grape, and cherry. It smells big, and potent (but somehow not anywhere near the 16.8% ABV it actually sports); it smells rich and wonderful.

Immediately and amazingly thick on the palate. Full bodied is an understatement, although it's not chewy. It's like a winter warmer riding a Zamboni over frozen molasses.

Tasting notes: unreal. Sweet, bordering on very sweet; hot, but not aggressive; thick, rich, decadent. Tasting notes are very similar to the nose. Bourbon (mostly sweet mash), port wine, cognac, rye, caramel, toffee, red grape, cherry, chocolate, molasses.

Absolutely phenomenal."
1898,dafla67,For Cory,4.6,"Pours very dark brown. Aroma is dominated by chocolate, bourbon, oaky and hints of vanilla. Taste is intense chocolate, caramel, bourbon and some dark fruit. Mouthfeel is full. Incredible stout."
1899,Luscious_Malfoy,For Cory,4.66,poured from a pink-waxed 375mL bottle into a SP LC tumbler. pours very dark brown with barely a finger of dark brown head. foam fades quickly and the beer in the glass has sections of dark maroon when the light hits it just right. a surprising amount of fudge and chocolate on the nose as well as strong bourbon and oak aromas. there’s some faint vanilla and figs as well. taste offers more toffee and caramel as well as chocolate all surrounded by bourbon barrel from start to finish. there’s some figs and raisin and port-like grapes qualities to the taste too. really good. a total supper. full mouthfeel that costs the mouth and leaves a sticky feeling on the finish. super good stuff.
1900,REVZEB,Abraxas - Barrel-Aged - Vietnamese Coffee,4.75,"I have been found most of the Abraxas variations recently to be good not great, but this one changed the narrative! This is absolutely fantastic, beer of the year candidate. Midnight black with a light brown head. Lush coffee, chocolate and vanilla meet cinnamon and peppers with an elegant barrel backing with solid malt and fudge sliding down the back on the sip. Smell focuses on the all but the back portion, full and potent yet so complimentary. Lush and warm with great textures, full bodied but not heavy or sticky, decently dry allowing the barrel and adjuncts to star. Waaaay better than ba abraxas!"
1901,dafla67,Abraxas - Barrel-Aged - Vietnamese Coffee,4.71,"Pours deep, jet black. Aroma is incredibly intense & intoxicating. Well balanced chocolate and coffee with complimentary notes of whiskey, cinnamon and vanilla. Taste matches the high bar set by the aroma -- coffee and chocolate with more present whiskey, cinnamon (it is Abraxas after all) and clear vanilla. Full mouthfeel. Best Abraxas version I've tasted."
1902,mschrei,Abraxas - Barrel-Aged - Vietnamese Coffee,5,"I love Abraxas and have always wanted to try the barrel aged version. Haven’t been able to get that, but when Tavour had this, I had to get it. Pricey, but so worth it. I’ve always thought the best thing about Abraxas has been that the flavors are sublime and balanced. The chocolate and vanilla bring a sweetness, the cinnamon and chiles bring the spice, and nothing overpower anything else. And now this one has coffee and whiskey barrel added, which only add to the experience. Feel is big and bold with quite a boozy presence. There’s just a bit of oily thickness, but I honestly don’t think it’s anything I mind. Really, I don’t see a single fault with this one."
1903,Luscious_Malfoy,Abraxas - Barrel-Aged - Vietnamese Coffee,4.67,"poured from a lime green-waxed 750mL bottle into a perennial snifter. pours thick and oily black with a thin dark brown foam cap. foam recedes into a thin collar around the glass plus a few small swirls scattered throughout. rich chocolate and coffee on the nose with whiskey barrel, faint cinnamon and even fainter vanilla. the coffee, peppers and whiskey barrel all combine to work with the base stout in a marvelous fashion. it’s chocolate-heavy, slightly peppery coffee beans aged in whiskey barrels with just the faintest touch of cinnamon and vanilla. the cinnamon comes off more flavorful than spicy, which i like. thick, almost creamy mouthfeel. sits heavy on the tongue and in the finish. really good BAA variant. i think the first i’ve ever had to my recollection. to me the coffee adds another layer that while the cinnamon and vanilla and even peppers have to play second fiddle to, they all reach a harmonious level at or near room temperature. really good stuff."
1904,Sabtos,Abraxas - Barrel-Aged - Vietnamese Coffee,4.53,"Glossy black with a short but creamy tan head settling to a flat collar with a ridged cling.

Abraxas unsurprisingly makes itself plenty apparent here with a shoryuken of its characteristically sweet, not spicy cinnamon to the dome, but with a unique angle that reminds me more of rice pudding than the Vietnamese rice pudding-themed stout we had a few pours heretofore. The added coffee somehow seems to encourage a creaminess I'm not used to from Abraxas.

I've got a bottle of this ($60 yikes!) and am really looking forward to digging further in to its nuances, as this was quite a unique variation on a classic stout I've otherwise had several encounters with."
1905,edthehead,Heady Topper - 20th Anniversary,4.5,"Murky pale orange appearance, small pour but seemingly fluffy white head, good retention, limited lacing. This beer pits the fruity hoppy character of regular heady against malty and piney undertones not present in regular heady. The result … a multi-dimensional IPA that is very good but not as good as the regular IMO. Maybe I’m just more used to the regular. We’ll see how the next batch compares."
1906,Gatch,Heady Topper - 20th Anniversary,4.64,"Lucky to have a great friend in judkinst who snagged me a four-pack since he lives locally and held onto this for a month or so. Obviously a big time beer, seeing as Heady is one of the greatest of all time. This is a heavy hitter, no doubt, both flavor and ABV%. Unfiltered and deep golden yellow. An onslaught of hops with heavy emphasis on the dank and resinous West Coast favorites. This is almost like a hybrid between NEIPA and WCIPA, which is fitting bc this beer changed the game. For the style and intention, this is really special. And appropriate for a 20 year anniversary. Legendary."
1907,jmdrpi,Heady Topper - 20th Anniversary,4.31,"16 oz can

pours a fairly clear orange yellow golden, thick white head. strong fruity and dank hop aroma. similar taste, a touch boozy, bitterness in the finish. sticky mouthfeel"
1908,Holderness,Heady Topper - 20th Anniversary,4.45,"On DRAFT(!!) at Blackback Pub in Waterbury. It's as advertised: Heady turned up a notch. The result is certainly more pungent and abrasive while still maintaining a smooth mouthfeel, although the ABV is also more prevalent. I'd definitely give the edge to OG Heady but glad to be able to give this a try

90/100"
1909,PSanger,Heady Topper - 20th Anniversary,4.43,Delicious beer that has the perfect balance between a ton of flavor but also being able to minimize the 10% alc that is contained within. The flavor is similar to the traditional beer but is a bit smoother with those delicious hops blowing the doors off! Great hoppy/piney flavor and the body/mouth feel is smooth. I Recommend.
1910,bubseymour,Heady Topper - 20th Anniversary,4.53,This comes across almost like a punchy West Coast high octane IPA. Very aggressively hopped and chewy piney. Not boozy and not to sweet or malty. Dialed in nicely. Enjoyed.
1911,GratefulBeerGuy,Heady Topper - 20th Anniversary,4.87,"Heady Topper 20th Anniversary

The Alchemist

IPA - Imperial / Double

That's the aroma I'm looking for! Just like freshly plucked and crushed up, hops off the vine. Husky lupulin sticky goodness. The flavor is immensely potent and deep: earthy, peppery citrus, and dank wet earth. The peppery effect is off the charts. Wow."
1912,superpete93,Heady Topper - 20th Anniversary,4.5,"Solid Imperial IPA. Drank it from the can, smell was hoppy with citrus--was definitely dank smelling! Tastes really mellow for an imperial IPA at 10% abv, very light bodied with a smooth finish. Not very boozy tasting at all--overall one of the better imperial IPA's I've tried."
1913,GreesyFizeek,Heady Topper - 20th Anniversary,4.37,"This one pours a mostly clear dark orange color, with a small head, and lots of lacing.

This smells quite spicy and dank, with marijuana, orange peel, grapefruit pith, and pineapple.

This does not improve on Heady Topper, but it’s still a fun beefing up on the classic. It’s a bit sweeter, naturally, but it’s surprisingly not all that boozy tasting, given the addition of 2 more ABV points. It’s super dank, bitter, and weedy, with grapefruit and orange peel, pineapple juice, and not all that much maltiness, which is a pleasant surprise.

This is kind of light bodied, with a pretty crisp finish, and a smooth bitterness on the back.

This was definitely better than some of their other bigger IPAs, like Crusher, and was a treat to be able to try."
1914,ovaltine,Heady Topper - 20th Anniversary,4.75,"The first thing that jumps out - this is almost clear. Like nothing but the most minimal hop haze possible, with a bit of floaties, certainly less than little brother.

It sits in the glass a beautiful orange color and sports a significant, soapy off white head that provides a decent amount of lacing. Absolutely gorgeous beer, and something I didn’t expect (the clarity).

The nose features that weedy Heady dankness, it’s just amped up. There’s gotta be a LOT of Simcoe in this, and I love that varietal, so I’m good. There’s tangerine, grapefruit, and pine on the nose, and I’m in heaven.

The taste is all about the interplay between the dank citrus and the resiny, bitter pine, as in Heady - the flavors are just bigger in this “big brother” iteration, and perfectly balanced with a bit of alcohol that settles in your chest as you drink the beer.

The mouthfeel has the gravitas expected with a 10% ABV beer. All of this verbiage is simply an attempt to illustrate The Alchemist’s prowess as a brewery, because they are tippity top world class."
1915,drdiesel9483,Beer:Barrel:Time (Rye 2023),4.8,"Look - black thick with nice lacing
Smell - bourbon barrel, rye, roasted malts, chocolate
Taste - about the same with booze and more spice
Feel - full body but lighter than expected with a medium light crisp carb
Overall - pretty outstanding"
1916,MJSFS,Beer:Barrel:Time (Rye 2023),5,"Light, fluffy liquid cake. Dark chocolate, leather, tobacco, coconut, vanilla,rye barrel char. Simply perfect…"
1917,lucius10,Beer:Barrel:Time (Rye 2023),4.58,"Dark/Baker's chocolate, barrel char, hint of molasses, and a rye-spicy, bourbon barrel nose on this one! Taste follows with a dark chocolate malty, hint of dark fruit, and a balanced bourbon barrel boozy finish. This is very smooth and has a velvety mouthfeel to it. Well done and great barrel representation! Great stuff!"
1918,minterro,Brew 7000,4.56,"Bottled on 04/22/23, consumed on 12/23/23 (review from notes).

A&S: The head is tan and dies very quickly when being poured. The head maintains in a faint ring. Dark brown beer. Super powerful raisins aroma when first cracked. Probably the most raisin aroma I have ever smelt in a beer. Once it is poured out that powerful raisin aroma dissipates a little. More bourbon and bitter figs.

T&M: The front taste is similar to the aroma (bourbon and figs). However, this morphs as the beer enters the back end of the taste, moving towards a super toffee and sweet side. Very drinkable, a little boozy, but well hidden for almost 14% ABV. Good carbonation, but still very smooth and on the lighter side of full-bodied.

Overall: Extremely good. Unless something changes in the next couple of days, this is my highest-ranked beer of 2023! Worth the price. Would recommend it if you can still find it. Fremont seems to be one of these breweries where I haven't tried as many of their beers as I should have by now. They are a hugely popular and seemingly great brewery, but I had a few beers I didn't love from them initially and I think that caused me to be unfairly biased. Looking forward to trying more of their special beers in the future."
1919,Beersnake,Brew 7000,4.49,"Poured at fridge temp. Pours very dark brown with almost no head. The nose is insane. Absolutely blown away. Huge notes of vibrant toffee. So much bourbon comes through, but this perfectly compliments the toffee. Vanilla, red wine, slight maple, and figs. 

The taste is intense as hell. Bourbon comes first, which brings notes of vanilla and oak. Figs, raisins, toffee, milk chocolate, and prunes. Lovely. Smooth, and the ABV is not detectable at all. 

Mouthfeel is medium bodied. The sweetness is MUCH lower than I got on previous versions. This is just creamy smooth and perfectly balanced."
1920,StonedTrippin,Brew 7000,4.21,"really fire, i kind of forgot how good this is, this special barleywine series, after missing 4000 and 6000, hope to one day find those, but drinking this fresh was a cool experience, its one to share for sure, definitely one for festive occasions, sweeter than i recall these ever being, but its been ages, brown sugar and toasted hazelnut and molasses all through it, a ton of whiskey, tons of alcohol in general, hot in aroma and in flavor and this is super intense overall at temperature. it has wonderful woody richness, decadent, toffee and maple, raisin and fig, and it feels oaty and bready and creamy and frothy, enough body and length to carry all this flavor, which i think is uncommon at this size, its quality is evident in this way. some whiskey spiciness, natural vanilla, a cola type note, some real definite nuttiness, praline maybe, and just the lightest smoke and char thing, could be from the barrel, lots of wood here. perhaps a shade darker on the grain side than a lot of barleywine, but its not into the roast range or anything, just a ton of grain depth, dark bready density. i also get some real umami here, an almost soy aspect, among all the sugar, gives it some real depth, and its kind of buttery and slick feeling while also having all the body imaginable. obviously this will age well, but i feel like i always have beers like this on the old side, so it was enjoyable to bust one out at its early peak, although some slight oxidation wouldnt hurt a thing. cigar and raisin notes at the end, cooked apple, good brandy, palate coating sweetness, warming me up front the inside out. fantastic overall, even if i cant drink a ton of it. a total treat for this time of year!"
1921,hmf05,Brew 7000,4.6,"This reminds me of a Tawny Port if it were aged in bourbon barrels. Big toffee, raisin, fig, and bourbon notes throughout. just a fantastic barleywine."
1922,mothman,Brew 7000,4.6,"Bottle. Little tan head that fades. Caramel hued dark brown.

Caramel, toffee, oak, vanilla, molasses, apple skins, figs, warming bourbon. Brown sugar and baking spice. 

Incredibly smooth and so much flavor. Very complex. Another winner in the Fremont series."
1923,sulldaddy,Brew 7000,4.39,"Sampling a waxed 22 oz bottle from April 22 2023. Beer is part of a BIF package. Sampling with my fremont stemless tulip sample glass.
the beer pours a rich , deep mahogany color with the little light that passes through reveals some garnet highlights. A dense beige head of about 1 cm foams up but is gone not long after the pour has filled my glass.
The aroma is pretty robust and malt driven with toffee and brown sugar and a good dose of bourbon. I dont get any wooden barrel notes on the nose and there isnt any fusol boozy notes, just bourbon hints. Also no hop characters on the nose.
First sip reveals a medium bodied and sticky textured beer. the carbonation is very fine and only slightly tingly. Drinks as a sipper because of the stickiness.
Flavor is definitely on the sweet side of things. I get some brown sugar and toffee with a bit of vanilla and bourbon notes too. Brown sugar seems to carry the flavor a little more than on the nose. Again no hop presence here. I do get some warmth from the booze on each swallow, but there isnt any accompanying pepper booze bite though.
The beer is tasty and enjoyable, maybe not the most complex barleywine as I dont get a lot of fruitiness or tobacco or anything , but I do enjoy it for what it does have sweet malts and some warming booze. Nice beer"
1924,DIM,Brew 7000,4.2,"This is on the sweet side but there is a lot here to like. I get a very strong date note along with brown sugar, figs, woody cinnamon, and plenty of smooth brown liquor. The body is a bit more thin than I expected. This might not quite live up to others in the series but it's worth seeking out."
1925,Sabtos,Derivation Blend #17,4.45,"No head builds over a tar black body that stains the glass brown.

A nose of Oreo ice cream and cream cheese cupcake gives way to a palate of vanilla bean drenched dark chocolate.

A fairly viscous constitution finishes with a touch of heat, and maybe a little cherry cordial.

It's times like these I wish I was as enamored with vanilla as others."
1926,REVZEB,Derivation Blend #17,4.72,"Glad we came back for a second night at the cellar because this was incredible! Shimmering black body with a brown ring. Takes the usual rugged SP blended stout with the char, earth, leather, etc with a willet emphasis but here the cognac brings out vanillins and vanilla beans in a creme brulee way, caramel and molasses too, dark fruits and dark chocolate fudge are enriched. Rich and rugged, full and heavy, chewy and warm, not sweetened in texture. Creative and intentional use of everything involved. This was a star of the whole trip to STL!"
1927,Luscious_Malfoy,Derivation Blend #17,4.69,"poured from an orange-waxed 375mL bottle into a SP BBT22 snifter. pours a dense black with virtually no foam. a few mocha colored swirls here and there. lots of barrel on the nose with this one. some muted vanilla but the spirit barrel dominates. the taste offers more chocolate and vanilla than the nose would suggest. there’s still some spirit barrel heat to it and an almost graham cracker flavored finish to it. insanely thick mouthfeel. sits heavy on the tongue and on the swallow. lower carbonation. i’m pleasantly shocked as the vanilla does not seem to be the star here, rather it compliments the base stouts and barrels perfectly for an exquisite combination of flavors. i remember feeling like D11 and 13 were just too vanilla forward for me. however, since then i have also grown a little fonder of vanilla BA stouts. but with this one i feel like the real mvp is the cognac barrels. adds just enough heat and contrast to the bourbon barrels. really well done BA vanilla stout. bring on the derivation that’s 100% cognac barrel-aged with vanilla!!"
1928,drdiesel9483,Derivation Blend #17,4.68,"Look - Black thick syrup with slight rimming
Smell - vanilla and barrel but fairly subtle
Taste - a lot of barrel and vanilla with some chocolate, subtle cognac. Really nice balance 
Feel - full thick body light carb slight creamy
Overall - Outstanding"
1929,tdm168,Dread & Breakfast,4.3,"Pours pitch black with a short lived brown head. The nose is complex. There is caramelized sugar, molasses, brown sugar, and barrel. The flavor has layers. At first there's caramelized sugar, dark fruit, and molasses followed by rich stout characteristics of chocolate, coffee, and roast. The barrel is present but not over powering as is the alcohol. Overall this is a really nice, complex offering. The sweetness slowed me down while sipping on it but pleasing nonetheless."
1930,FRANKHAZE,Dread & Breakfast,4.04,"This was nice, but wouldn't go for another. Much preferred 'Deth by Cherries'. Body/mouthfeel is rather on the weak side here."
1931,SpeedwayJim,Dread & Breakfast,4.31,"12oz. Can into a Side Project snifter. 

Pours pitch black. A touch thin. A coarse layer of bubbles dissipates quickly. Slick oily legs. No legs. Nose is maple syrup, smoke, roasted coffee beans, and chocolate. Deep and rich. Very aromatic. Beer opens maple syrup, roasted coffee beans, and a touch of smoke. Some brine, chocolate, and more syrup in the middle. Roasted malt, cocoa powder, and coffee at the end and finish. Body is medium with moderate to low carbonation. Some bubbles on the palate and prickly going down. Sticky, lingering aftertaste. 

The body is a bit lacking here and hurts what is otherwise a near perfect beer."
1932,drdiesel9483,Dread & Breakfast,4.4,"Look - Black and thick, quickly disappearing head but nice rimming and lacing
Smell - coffee maple chocolate barrel and smoke
Taste - Sweet maple blended with a roasty coffee along with the chocolate and woody barrel with the smoke in the rea. Nice blend, not overly done on anything
Feel -Medium full body with a lighter carbonation
OVerall - Really solid. More body and this would be lights out!"
1933,Herbabee,Dread & Breakfast,4.75,"pretty ramped-up concoction! opaque raven-brown with a light edge, yielded a bubbly, tan capper when poured, nose of sweetness, cinnamon, and oh the fumes!
pretty sugary on the tongue upon first impression, but the strong coffee, smoky roasts, barrel woods (and requisite fumage) cut right through. (a later revisit brings forth a noticeable coconut presence and even an incense-y burn upon the palate. really chocolaty too. wait, a nuance of dried prune in there also. Shape-shifting and complex)

this should be a one-and-done deal for tonight."
1934,CarolinaCardinals,Dread & Breakfast,4.59,"Received a 12 oz Mystery can from @DIM 12-7-23.

Beer pours a brown with a very nice off-white head. 

Nose is giving me caramelized or mildly roasted malts along with strong notes of cinnamon or cassia bark. Can’t get much past the cinnamon and not detecting a discernible barrel presence.

Taste is a large warming mildly roasted malt base, getting notes of light and dark fruits so I suspect there is a barrel presence, perhaps brandy or cognac. Cinnamon/Cassia is definitely the dominating flavor. Each sip ends in a semi-intense warming which suggest perhaps a bourbon barrel aging. Finishes balanced, each sip so damn good! Guessing the ABV is in the 11-14 range.

Mouthfeel is medium bodied with each sip being smooth.
Overall this is a delicious beer that I find myself already wanting a second one!

The reveal:
Revolution Brewing’s Dread & Breakfast which weighs in at 15.9% abv, a wonderful cuvee of 5 different beers and finished on French Oak, 2.5 lbs per barrel coffee and part of it on Amburana wood which was obviously very fresh! Canned 7-7-23, this beer is irresistible as I am getting wine notes and cinnamon city but not getting discernible notes of coffee nor bourbon, in which a great cuvee blend does! Thanks Dan for sharing this wonderful beer!"
1935,Whyteboar,Dread & Breakfast,4.43,"Poured stout black with a light brown head of 1 finger which was both less dense and shorter lived than expected.
Of course, considering the ABV, I should be surprised it had a head at all.
The aroma is sadly lost on me, stupid Covid.
The taste was so well blended and balanced that the bourbon, while present, was more an essence than a flavor. Sweet malt base which flies in the face of the other BBA stouts from them that I have tried; the smooth dark fruit and coffee and chocolate. Really nice.
The feel belied the ABV. A little less viscous than I would have expected but still well within specs.
OA, I drank it a bit faster than I should have but enjoyed it so much that I had trouble stopping. Good beer."
1936,REVZEB,Dread & Breakfast,4.26,"Pours like a stout with a beige ring. Smells strongly of dark roast coffee with strong maple, bittersweet chocolate, bourbon soaked raisin, and wet dark oak supporting, very potent. Taste is laced with the coffee, maple is firmly less here, molasses, cocoa, and earth, not as balanced as nose, ending is bitter with the coffee triumphing. Feel is very warm with moderate coffee percolation pushing through the smooth viscosity of the body, lighter than expected, sticky. Overall it has a sweetness that adds but it hit by the booze and more so coffee to pull back, interesting"
1937,Beersnake,Dread & Breakfast,4.46,"Poured at fridge temp. Pours a nice thick black with an inch of quickly disappearing head. 

Nose is spice, maple syrup, graham crackers, walnuts, coconut, cocoa powder, and some vanilla. What's odd is that I'm not getting much coffee or bourbon on the nose, although I will say that a hint of coffee comes through as it warms. 

The taste is really nice and smooth. Sweet bourbon, vanilla, pancakes, maple syrup, baking chocolate, amburana, nuts, oak, anise, slight marshmallow, lightly roasted coffee, and caramel candy.

The mouthfeel is pretty thick and creamy. The aftertaste is a sweet chocolate cake frosting."
1938,edthehead,10 Candles,5,"Black oily appearance with no head and oily fingers. Bold yet smooth bourbon barrel flavors, and masterful mildly sweet bakers vanilla. So well balanced between the barrel and the adjunct, and the ABV so nicely masked. Thick and smooth as silk. Can’t think of a better representation of vanilla in a stout than this. Lovely!"
1939,WickedBeer,10 Candles,4.9,"Insane viscosity; the leg retention is off the charts. Zero carb.

The nose is one of the best I’ve ever experienced. Chocolate cake w/ vanilla frosting. Hot chocolate w/ marshmallows. 

Barrel really features on palate. Vanilla is present to cut the character from being overbearing. That said, good barrel heat with baking chocolate, bourbon-soaked oak, and a touch of drying tannin on the tail.

Great viscosity, smooth and slightly syrupy with a mildly tannic, hot finish."
1940,drdiesel9483,10 Candles,4.84,"Look - black thick syrup
Smell - vanilla, chocolate and barrel 
Taste - same as smell, sweet slight booze
Feel - full body creamy light light carb
Overall - fantastic"
1941,swid,10 Candles,4.9,"10 Candles is just a brownish hint on the rim short of being completely black. Served still. Swirling it around leaves fingers that remain on the (alas, plastic) glass. The aroma is very vanilla-forward, with dark chocolate becoming noticeable later. The taste is also very vanilla-forward; combined with the barrel notes, it turns out with a marshmallow flavor. It’s a dessert in a glass, and is very delightful."
1942,edthehead,Cuvée De Grâce (2023),4.5,"Dark brown black appearance with a modest tan head. Bourbon and fig on the nose, with flavors of bourbon, oak barrel, fig, molasses. Thick rich mouthfeel, moderate to light carbonation. Listed as a strong ale but could easily pass as a stout. Highly recommend this one."
1943,REVZEB,Cuvée De Grâce (2023),4.51,"Blackish and almost reddish brown body, tan collar. Aromas of dark and bright wood, leather, smoke with a hint of peat, rye, bittersweet chocolate, blackstrap molasses with hints of dark cherry skins, wet earth, and barley. Taste features the molasses and caramel tones seeping into bourbon soaked oak made famous in deep woods series, with surrounding leather, smoke, rye, char, with mild anise, barley, licorice, black cherry, dry earth, and bitter chocolate. Feel is smooth and boozy with sharp woods in a good way, yet this is robust like the nose foretold, carb is higher for style, massive beer, warming but a little thin on the finish. God I love this series, strong ales this refined and complex on the palate are a marvel to behold"
1944,stortore,Cuvée De Grâce (2023),4.47,"12 ounce can into a snifter. Canned 7/7/23, had 9/16/23. Also had on tap at the release.

Pours a somewhat opaque dark ruby color, with a brief head and light foamy lacing. Aromas of bourbon, figs, tobacco, caramel, rye, raisins, oak. Has a spicy smell. Similar flavors: bourbon, oak, caramel, rye, figs, malt, some tobacco. Has a spicy taste. Smooth, a very good medium body, appropriately carbonated. 

Every bit as good as the two previous versions, this one with more spicy rye than the others. So many flavors and aromas. Best fully warmed."
1945,beergoot,Cuvée De Grâce (2023),4.2,"Deep, dark mahogany red body, clear pour, opaque in the glass; thin head, khaki colored. Fantastic smell; roasted grains, dark pitted fruits, tobacco, charred oak. Richly sweet flavor; figs and dates; tobacco; black licorice; brown sugar; low-key whiskey flavor. Heavy body; viscous and sticky.

A unique take on blended barrel aged beers. The beer oozes richness and depth with a deep yet very approachable bourbon undercurrent.

Pouring temperature: 48 °F; canning info: 07-07-2023

1946,mschrei,Cuvée De Grâce (2023),4.47,"Dark brown/Ruby pour. Smell is brown sugar, dark fruit, mild barrel, a bit astringent. Taste isn’t as strong. Not as big and bold as I expect, but boozy and tasty. Excellent."
1947,Rug,Cuvée De Grâce (2023),4.47,"Canned 7/7/23

This is a massive cuvée, using a blend of 7 different component beers. Given the lineup of beers in the blend, I have a hatd time believing that this will be anything short of amazing. Let’s crack it open and see what it’s all about

Pours almost completely pitch black with 2 fingers of creamy dark tan head that slowly fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing

The nose is definitely sweet, but in a complex way that doesn’t become cloying. I’m picking up on aromas of dates, toasted oak, toasted walnut, molasses, black cherry, sweet bourbon, brown sugar, milk chocolate, light caramel, and orange peel

It’s even a touch sweeter in taste but still so well executed. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting black cherry, molasses, cocoa powder, dark toast, burnt caramel, brown sugar, raisin, toasted oak, sweet bourbon, and poached pear. The swallow brings notes of toasted oak, molasses, sweet bourbon, black cherry, orange peel, cocoa powder, brown sugar, vanilla, toasted coconut, and light raisin

A medium full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a smooth beer. Finishes mostly dry and drinks well below its abv

This is so damn good. I’m not surprised given Revolution’s reputation for massive barrel aged beers, but I’m just happy to be drinking it"
1948,DokiDokiLitFam,Cuvée De Grâce (2023),4.53,"The appearance is the color of a barleywine, but the opacity of a stout. Light brown with very little translucence at the edges. Nose is oak for days, accompanied with bourbon, caramel, vanilla, roasted malt, coconut, dark fruit, and ethanol for sure. Taste is similar. Strong oak presence, slight dark fruits covered in confection, roasted malt, bringing a very faint chocolate and coffee, and some hop presence. The ethanol heat doesn't seem to be too strong on the palate. It is drying, but it doesn't illicit images of deserts in your mind. The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied. Almost no carbonation. Overall a great brew. I didn't realize this was a whopping nearly 16%. I thought it was around 14%. Seeing as I've finished this can and my vision is swimming, I can say that, while this brew does not hide its power on the nose, it does it better while drinking. Which I feel matters just a little bit more."
1949,papposilenus,Golden Fern,3.1,"From a 16oz can, dated 10/10/23. ‘He who has the gold makes the rules.’ Well, fair enough. Served in a spiegelau IPA glass.

Pours thick-appearing and seemingly orange juice-like with a scant half-finger of soapy suds. Retention is unremarkable, leaving a creamy collar and a rousable spattering of slippery lacing.

Nose is vaguely vinous. Aromas of white wine and gasoline fumes.

Taste is not dissimilar to the nose. White wine and gasoline with hints of citrus peel. 

Feel is juicy with a thick, creamy body. Bright, prickly carbonation. Boozy warmth in the gullet.

Overall, not utterly awful - despite my having described it as white wine and gasoline. Not terribly interesting. Still, at 8.2% abv, it gets the job done."
1950,brodyonthecorner,Golden Fern,4.44,"L: beautiful light orange haze with a thick white head
S: somewhat vegetal and herby, notes of peach, melon, orange
T: super creamy and juicy, notes of orangsicle, dry and a bit herbacuous, some general grape, peach fruitiness, touch of bitter finish
Overall another excellent treehouse neipa. Not as flavorful as others but still very good and unique"
1951,tigg924,Golden Fern,4.29,"Had ontap at Sandwich. Pours milky, pale gold in color with one quarter inch head. Taste is white grape, oak, starfruit, dank hops, and peach. Heavy body, moderate carbonation, slightly bitter. Way better than Silver Fern. Nice showcase of New Zealand hops."
1952,Damian,Spacetime Continuum - Ultimate Coconut,4.55,"Drank from a 12 oz. sparkly midnight blue wax dipped bottle purchased at Tree House Brewing Company, Tewksbury, MA
Served in a tulip

The beer poured a shimmery, oily and dense, complete pitch black. A frothy, near finger-tall, burnt sienna colored crown topped the liquid, but it quickly disappeared. There was no lacing whatsoever. As the beer receded, thin legs trickled all down the glass. Oily droplets could be seen floating atop the body initially, but they melded into the liquid rather quickly.

The aroma was a total coconut bomb. Toasted coconut specifically. Semisweet chocolate also came through strong. Big, boozy, bourbon notes were also apparent. Loads of brown sugar sweetness too.

The flavor profile followed the nose to a T. Coconut came through strongest. Semisweet chocolate was also quite noticeable. Loads of rich caramel malts and brown sugar in the center. Big, boozy bourbon notes appeared on the back end and crescendoed in the finish. The alcohol was quite punchy initially, but it mellowed as the beer sat.

Excellent rich, dense, oily mouthfeel. Full bodied for the style. The liquid contained a super fine, mellow effervescence that turned creamy, slick and smooth on the palate.

Spacetime Continuum - Ultimate Coconut is an excellent coconut-forward pastry stout and a perfect celebratory beer to ring in the new year. While I am not certain that this is notably better than most of the other offerings in Tree House’s barrel-aged series, I am glad I got to try it."
1953,TheeWarPig,Spacetime Continuum - Ultimate Coconut,4.72,Outstanding! Coconut bomb! Well executed.
1954,drdiesel9483,Spacetime Continuum - Ultimate Coconut,4.87,"Look - black thick slight initial head and rimming and very sticky
Smell - coconut chocolate coffee vanilla barrel
Taste - same as the smell, sweet but not overly sweet
Feel - thick creamy slight carb, perfect 
Overall - really fantastic"
1955,lucius10,Spacetime Continuum - Ultimate Coconut,4.63,"Sweet milk chocolate, raw coconut flesh, and a balanced, bourbon barrel nose on this one! Taste follows with some milk chocolate covered coconut upfront...and then some vanilla and a well-integrated, bourbon barrel boozy finish. Yum! As it warms and opens up, a slight cacao and coffee roasty bitterness peeks out, but this stays contained as it balances out the chocolate and coconut sweetness upfront. This is fantastic!"
1956,DokiDokiLitFam,Spacetime Continuum - Ultimate Coconut,4.64,"Wow, this one is a treat. It reminds me of a Anchorage Stout. The huge coconut profile combined with the huge malt profile comes together to make a chocolate coconut ice cream quality. The partial barrel age blend does a good job to make it even more complex. Getting a slight almond note on the nose. Perhaps the malt? The roast is still pretty prevalant considering the sweetness. The mouthfeel is massive. Thick and fullbodied. Like melted ice cream. Delicious brew by Tree House. This is absolutely a dessert brew. Share with a friend."
1957,Holderness,Spacetime Continuum - Ultimate Coconut,4.17,"Basically a cross between a liquid coconut macaroon and a liquid tub of vanilla frosting. Really close to being overly cloying, but the velvetiness of the mouthfeel and the depth of the bourbon barrel character keep it from going too far over. Definitely a sipper, best shared with at least one other person.

84/100"
1958,Roguer,Spacetime Continuum - Ultimate Coconut,4.53,"Very small head, but an attractive beer overall.

Nose is rich and inviting, featuring bourbon, oak, chocolate, coffee, molasses, caramel, toffee, cream. The alcohol stands out quite a bit, but not unpleasantly.

Flavor is just as rich and decadent as the nose promised, but not overly sweet. Tasting notes include coconut, bourbon, chocolate, vanilla, toffee, oak, brown sugar, sherry, cherry. Lingering caramel and vanilla notes on the finish, along with a very mild and comforting alcohol heat in the back of the throat.

Thick and chewy. You can tell it's a big, boozy beer, but it's incredibly mild and approachable. Very easy to sip, sit, chew, and savor. Not so sweet that it demands to be seen as a dessert beer; more on the rich and decadent side of things."
1959,DavetotheB,Silver Fern,4.63,"From a 16oz can dated 11/7/23 into a pint glass. There's a can message but it's half on and half off the bottom of the can.

Pours a thick opaque pale yellow with about one finger of white head. Pretty good retention and excellent lacing. Beautiful looking NEIPA.

Mainly pineapple, grass and earth on the crack of the can. A little warming gives some peach and grapes and maybe a hint of orange.

Some good vibes of sweet white wine and tropical fruit in the taste. But there's also a strong bitter backbone. Earthy and grassy.

Thick, full-bodied mouthfeel. Medium carbonation. Nice bitter aftertaste.

These are the best Tree House beers to me. Strong juice up front with strong bitterness on the back end."
1960,brewme,Silver Fern,4.5,"Had a single draft at Tree House in Sandwich for eight dollars. My three hundred and thirty ninth brew from these guys. Great beer, will try in cans."
1961,TheeWarPig,Silver Fern,4.68,Underrated. Outstanding!!
1962,WunderLlama,Silver Fern,4.34,"Brewers notes: New Zealand contains a kaleidoscope of changing landscapes and terrains, each peak and valley offering its own unique world. All that the sun touches is ablaze with otherworldly hues, and pink and purple mountains crest and devolve into fertile plains and thickets of dense jungle. Wandering under the shadows of these mountains and hills, the moon chasing the sun into powdery dusk, mysteries bloom against the darkness.
The Silver Fern, steeped in indigenous and modern New Zealand culture, is a sight unlike any other across the globe. The undersides of this primeval flora reflect silvery light, illuminating paths with haunting electricity and revealing trails to hunters as they are bent towards the canopy.

Silver Fern is a delicious Double IPA showcasing the magic of New Zealand's terroir when observed in the right light and wielded with proficient reverence. With a vigorous pour, Nelson and Peacharine Hops meld the sweet perfume of white grape and floral summer peach. Underneath this bouquet, Motueka bursts with sweet tropical fruits, and Waimea provides an undercurrent of citrus peel and subtle woody aromatics. We hope you enjoy this dangerously quaffable treat and ponder what treasures lie hidden in plain sight.

16 oz Canned on 11/7/23. 

“Beer of the year?“

Yellowish orange hazy liquid , one finger white foam cap , streaky lacings 

Aroma is orange citrus, white grape ,pineapple, lime , whiff of peach 

Taste is peach, white grape, pineapple, orange

Smooth mouthfeel, soft hop kiss at the finish

Good beer"
1963,Rug,Silver Fern,4.34,"Canned 11/7/23. “Beer of the year?“ stamped on the bottom of the can. I sure hope so

And we have yet another Tree House New Zealand hopped beer. They seem to be all the rage lately and although I quite enjoyed God Of The Forest I had yesterday, I didn’t really find it to be up to snuff with the rest of their NEIPAs. Let’s crack this one open and see if it’s any better

Pours a hazy milky yellow with 2 fingers of soapy off white head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing

The nose here is very vibrant, nicely balanced between tropical and bitter. I’m picking up on aromas of pineapple juice, weedy hops, lime zest, papaya, white grape, bready malt, toasted coconut, light passionfruit, and pithy grapefruit

It’s not quite as impactful in taste, less balanced and strangely herbal but still damn good for what it is. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting pineapple juice, line zest, bready malt, mango skin, grassy hops, peach skin, white grape, and light white pepper. The swallow brings notes of mango skin, toasted coconut, woody hops, lime zest, mango skin, dank weed, pineapple juice, bready malt, and light basil

A medium body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a smooth beer. Finishes mostly dry and nicely balanced

This one is damn tasty. It strikes the balance of fruity and spicy quite nicely"
1964,thebeers,Silver Fern,4.08,"Crazy cloudy light OJ color with a dense off-white head. Decent retention and thick lacing.

Pungent aroma with orange juice, underripe pineapple and distant jungle flowers.

The taste follows. Spearmint and other sweet herbs, white wine, orange citrus and light bitterness in the finish.

Super soft, creamy mouthfeel. Just a hint of carbonation barely cutting through.

A very high-quality brew."
1965,Sheppard,Silver Fern,4,"Pours a Minute Maid orange juice pale opaque yellow. It's got unripe orange and sour mango on the nose. It's got a zesty punch of unripe orange, some Tropicana banana/tropical juice in the body, with a residual resiny edge to it. I've found Tree House's recent run of Southern Hemisphere interesting to great and this falls more on the interesting side. The execution is still good. This isn't a bad beer. It just doesn't wow."
1966,DVMin98,Ultimate Machine,4.62,"Deep murk. Mild head. Some residual lacing. Deep, pungeant hop aroma. Taste is a hop punch in the face. Lots of tropical fruits. Delicious. Feel is moderate bodied. Can almost chew the haze. Great beer."
1967,WickedBeer,Ultimate Machine,4.66,"Canned 6/13/23, ‘I AM INEVITABLE I AM ULTIMATE MACHINE’.

Saturated golden color; frothy white carb. Nose loaded w/ ripe orange, pineapple, & hints of guava. There’s a distinctly potent overripeness to the overall aroma, w/ undertones of sweet, floral hops. Palate is full, tropical, grassy, & mildly bitter."
1968,brewandbbq,Ultimate Machine,4.36,"16oz can dated 6/13/23.

1972,lucius10,Ultimate Machine,4.36,"Sweet tropical hoppy, orange juicy citrus, and a slightly malty nose on this one! Taste follows with a soft and creamy, tropical hoppy, and an orange juice citrus bitter finish. This is darn near crushable for a triple and drinks really easy...big ABV is well-hidden. I haven't sought out many Tree House Beers lately, but this one makes me rethink that approach. This is not the most super expressive in the hop department, but it is really enjoyable to drink!"
1973,Ushouldbeworkinh,Ghost Prime,3.55,"Nice appearance, smell and taste are just lacking. One not citrus, lacking in potency. It must have been stored at room temperature for those 2 months, just not enough flavour."

Beer opens pear, starfruit, and citrus. Some pine, pineapple, and more pale citrus fruit in the middle. Juicey sweet end with a lightly waxy, tropical hop sweetness in the aftertaste. Body is light to medium with moderate to ample carbonation. Soft but prickly on the palate and goes down crisp and dry with a long, lingering, dry aftertaste. Some powderiness. 

This is excellent and well worth trying if you're a fan of the original."
1978,mschrei,Ghost Prime,4.59,"I will drink any and every iteration of Ghost in the Machine Parish will ever make. Orange juice like appearance, foamy head and lacing. Smell is strong citrus, tangy and dank. Taste follows, a bit of a West Coast piney aftertaste. Medium bodied, full mouth watering feel, subtle booze. An excellent juice bomb."
1979,BEERchitect,Ghost Prime,4.46,"And just like that, I ain't 'fraid of no ghosts! Now I embrace them.

Taking their ghosts to the prime level, Parish's Ghost Prime transcend the machine and goes Prime starting with a totally foggy haze tha's saturating with pastel golden and matte orange hues. Crowned with a creamy lather of white foam, it's aromas tease the senses with even more of the radiant juiciness of grapefruit, blood orange, pineapple, mango and passionfruit than its preceding ghosts. Its radiant fruit scent soon carries over to an early palate sweetness of cereal, honey and poundcake.

As the taste develops, the ale slowly trends toward a drying finish, laying down glimpses of tantalizing citrus, tropical and orchard fruit in its wake. Passionfruit, papaya, cantaloupe, lemon, lime and apricot complete the fruit-forward cocktail as the beer's hop-centric grassiness begins to rise. Fresh grass clippings, freshly shaven spruce and hints of hemp pull from the hop's juiciness and create a smooth bitterness to out-duel the malt sweetness late on the palate.

Full bodied, smooth and creamy on the palate, the ale's charming roundness of cream-sickle seems to retain its maltiness well to offer a firm counterpart to the hops. Both ride off into the finish with a gentle hop grip in the throat that slimly outlasts the candied malt."
1980,Seanjohnhunt,Bourbon Barrel Double Paradise,4.68,"Pours dark as hell. Smells of coconut and vanilla. Rich, chocolatey, coconut, vanilla goodness. This one is boozy! I like it but wish it had another flavor profile added to it and the mouthfeel was just a little more chewy. Dam good pastry stout."
1981,mothman,Bourbon Barrel Double Paradise,4.5,"On tap. Tan head. Black color. Leaves legs.

Strong, bourbon, oak, char, fudge, coconut. Warming. Big barrel flavor. Chewy oak. Smooth and doesn’t have a pastry mouthfeel which is nice. Delicious."
1982,maximum12,Bourbon Barrel Double Paradise,4.32,"It’s been a spell since my last new Prairie stout; too long a spell. When they arrived in MN it was in force & we’ve since become a distribution backwater. 12 oz. bottled 10/31/23. 

Stout black, just like the watercolor of the same name. The nose is chocolate dipped bourbon. OK by me. 

Bourbon Barrel Double Paradise scorches. The bourbon is intense, not harsh, but smooth. Smooth. It’s an interesting effect. That comes from the vanilla, layered on with no seams or bumps or potholes, filling any passing cragginess from the bourbon. Nice chocolate, low levels of coconut, with a sinus-clearing level of booziness (oh; I see the ABV now). Better than NyQuil. Thick. Lovely. After one my judgment would be impaired enough to pop open another. Luckily, the other one is room temp. 

When on their game, this is what Prairie does: top-notch barrel aged stouts. This hits the spot. An excellent beer."

S - mango and orange soda. Honeydew and ice water. Smells simultaneously refreshing and body-hurting. 

T - bright and tropical. Mango lassi, bitey orange cream citrus, and a tart twang. Resiny hop oils contrast with soft, billowing melon-flavored bubblegum. Jam-packed with fruit but balanced by pungent hoppy bitterness, although it's more of a lingering electricity. 

F - silky, creamy, and dense. Like the carbonation is actively fighting the heft within. 

O - perhaps a bit oily and bitter for Julius, but I will never tire of these variants. Long live Tree House."

1989,Smakawhat,Liquid King,4.62,"Poured from the can into a Spiegelau IPA glass.

Creamed off white vanilla colored head, easily reaching three to four fingers with fine bubbles and a soft top. Pale orange and opaque to hints of dull brown and yellow along the edges with a simple but pleasant body enough to the eyes. Sheets of nice little ring lacing while drinking like coated tiger stripes.

Rich beaming aroma. Creamsicle orange with thick rich vanilla and even a big aroma of white chocolate that is oh so to die for. Tangerine and citrus juice hinting on the edges making for an absolute knockout combination. Fruit angle is surprisingly something you have to dig around which makes it even more of a pleasure amongst this cake and chocolate like cream decadence.

And as if that wasn’t enough the beer delivers more. Rich creamed orange followed by hop notes of mint and sage. Creamed vanilla and ice milk, with spicy orange and oils that hits like sweet perfume. Light bodied even almost truly liquid but has so much texture somehow. Literaly rolls off the tongue like silk, with hints of some faint mango and tropical sweetness.

Real dang impressive stuff. Even the lighter body, makes for easier drinking even if it somehow manages to still feel and taste creamy and rich."

1993,gbiello,Eleventh Anniversary,4,Too much Mosaic
1994,agreenman19,Eleventh Anniversary,4.65,"L - milky faded yellow with one finger of off-white head that dissipates into a thick ring of lacing. Quite a lot going on with this can label!

S - immediately out of the glass it's like cracking a fresh container of chopped fruit. Mango, berries, melons. Keep catching wafts as the glass sits within arm's reach. They should make candles or Febreze out of this stuff!

T - mix of juicy and hoppy. There definitely be hops in here, not-so-subtly hinted at by what feels like intense dry-hopping. Earthy overtones balance a peppery spiciness of grapefruit rind and pithy orange citrus. Pineapple twang gives way to warm, cozy booziness that dances delicately with the bitter hoppiness. 

F - smooth criminal. Creamy, pillowly, and silky. A joy to swish between the teeth. 

O - surprisingly, not as flamboyantly juicy as I'd expect for an anniversary beer. But it is robust and conveys a powerful presence. Warm and inviting. This is a strong entry into TH's lineup, probably never to be seen again. Oh well."

1997,TheeWarPig,Space Between Truths,4.69,Very smooth. Excellent!
1998,Damian,Space Between Truths,4.39,"Drank from a black wax dipped 12 oz. bottle purchased at Tree House Brewing Company, Charlton, MA
Served in a tulip

Pretty extreme appearance. The beer poured a super summery and viscous, total pitch black with no head nor any lacing. This looked nearly identical to a glass of used motor oil.

The aroma was terrific. Really rich, malty and boozy. Quite intense overall. Huge dark fruit presence. Bourbon soaked raisins came to mind. Moderate amount of char and roast. Some vanilla was also noticeable. Touch of burnt sugar too.

The flavor profile was similar to the nose but even boozier. Super malty and bourbon forward. Roasted malts were most prominent. Touch of caramel malt and brown sugar-like sweetness too. Charred raisins were also noticeable. Hint of vanilla. The bourbon/boozy notes crescendoed on the back end and in the finish. This definitely drank hotter than I anticipated given the modest 10% ABV.

Terrific oily, full bodied mouthfeel. Creamy and slick on the palate. The liquid contained a super fine and mellow effervescence that worked nicely for the style.

Space Between Truths is an impressive, boozy and intense, barrel-aged imperial stout by Tree House that really showcases the complex array of bourbon barrel threads. While this brewery is often lauded for its pastry stouts, they have been releasing more pure barrel-aged bangers like this lately, and that is definitely a good thing in my book."
1999,SawDog505,Space Between Truths,4.58,"Poured into a 13 oz Teku glass not sure when it was bottled. Pours near pitch black with a half finger sticky light brown head that leaves a few thin streaks of lace with solid retention. 4.5

Aroma is roasty coffee, char, vanilla, dark chocolate, back strap molasses, and a healthy dose of bourbon. 4.5

Taste follows deep dark chocolate, vanilla, coffee, char, back strap molasses, and bourbon lingers after each sip. 4.5

Mouthfeel is above average, maybe a tad dry, gentle carbonation, and not sure what the ABV but it drinks rather large, but because it is so complex it goes down easy enough. 4.75

Overall this is a beast and crazy complex, very expensive, but worth the try. Impressive stuff. 4.75"
2000,drdiesel9483,Space Between Truths,4.9,"Look - black thick very slight head and rimming fantastic lacing
Smell - dark chocolate vanilla char woody
Taste - slight sweet vanilla dark chocolate char woody slight coffee
Feel - full body creamy light carb
Overall - pretty fantastic!"
2001,GreesyFizeek,Space Between Truths,4.56,"This one pours a very dark black color, with a small head, and a little bit of lacing.

This smells like dark chocolate covered espresso beans, caramel, fudge brownies, maple bourbon candies, and oaky vanilla.

This is absolutely tremendous. There’s a lot of barrel – mostly spicy oak with some vanillin, and a nice candied bourbon like flavor. There’s tons of dark chocolate here, with some roasty coffee notes, and a touch of caramel sweetness.

This is medium bodied, creamy, and rich, with very little booziness.

This is really quite good – Tree House stouts lately are just so on point"
2002,Roguer,Space Between Truths,4.56,"Incredible bourbon-forward aroma. Notes of chocolate, molasses, coconut, vanilla, toffee, caramel, brown sugar, oak, red grape, corn, toast, light char.

Similar on the palate, albeit not quite as thick and rich as expected. There is a very light sharpness to the barrel aspect (and no doubt the ABV, which I suspect is quite high, although not disclosed on the bottle), but it's not exactly sour, either. Tasting notes are similar to the nose - almost identical. I would prefer a bit more richness and depth, but that's very much nit-picking; this is world class, and among the best blended BA stouts I've ever experienced from Tree House."
2003,Holderness,Space Between Truths,4.5,"Anything with Truth in it seems destined to be a winner -- it's just a really great base barrel-aged stout both alone and when blended with friends. The blending with Space and Time reduces the sweetness and gives it a nice roasty complexity without being too char-forward or bitter. Very nice although pricey

90/100"
2004,lucius10,Platinum Fern,4.55,"Sweet tropical hoppy, slightly malty, a hint of white wine grape, apricot-peachy, and a lemony-orange citrus nose on this one! Taste follows with a super-soft and creamy, tropical hoppy and a slightly earthy, stonefruity citrus dank bitter finish. Really nice mouthfeel here! I just needed the malt profile to be dialed back a bit to let this great hop profile shine more...seems like the hop expression was slightly smothered here. Outside of that, this is great!"
2005,brewandbbq,Platinum Fern,4.5,"On tap in Tewksbury.

Presents cloudy gold with plenty of retention and lacing. Pungent in the nose with heaps of tropical fruit and a hint of vanilla. Medium bodied with a soft mouthfeel. Mouthfull of hops and zero heat. Finishes with minimal bitterness or malt. 
King of the Fern series!"
2006,jrc1093,Double Barrel Benthic (2023),4.19,"Canned on 3/28/2023; consumed on 11/2/2023

Pours a viscous, oily midnight-black body capped with a temporary finger and a half of soapy, hazelnut-hued foam, dissipating quickly to a near-blank surface, slim, creamy collar, and minimal-no lacing holding to the walls of the glass.

Aroma opens to a distinctly chocolatey roast sporting heavy wafts of oaky bourbon against a lush coconut macaroon background; a subtle air of dark-roast coffee meets a vanilla tinge, while notes of toasted coconut shavings phase into bolder char on the latter end of the bouquet.

Taste brings cocoa and an intense but level bourbon imbuement upfront, easing to fragrant char balancing a coconut mid-palate, followed by an oaky cherry aspect and a tinge of burnt coffee on the finish.

Mouthfeel shows a medium-full body pronouncing silky, rich textures over a building background char, leaving the minimal carbonation producing a faint, roasty prockle ceding to burly warmth and creamier undertones toward a slightly sticky, largely dry finish.

Heavy oak softens refined coconut decadence to balance, with malt char and coffee roast developing in suit toward an adept intersection of adjuncted savvy and broader bourbon influence."
2007,mpruden,Double Barrel Benthic (2023),4.69,"8 oz nitro pour into a tulip glass at the brewery.

Appearance: Very dark brown, with a 1” brown head that lingered, leaving abundant, smooth lacing.

Nose: Dark roast, coffee, chocolate, and coconut.

Mouthfeel: Smooth and creamy, adequate carbonation.

Attack: Follows the nose perfectly but even more fully, plus alcohol that does not overwhelm the flavor, even with the 16.6% ABV. Remarkable!

Finish: Just enough bitterness.

Overall: Outstanding job, Half Acre! This is comparable to a Founders CBS — this is one of the finest BA Imperial Stouts I’ve ever had."
2008,REVZEB,Double Barrel Benthic (2023),4.4,"Had on tap. Pitch black pour, finger of brown foam. Honestly I found regular benthic to be much better. The smell here is great with amped up coffee, coconut, and most of all bourbon barrel, with vanilla and chocolate fudge supporting, all good but not as rich as regular. Taste this is more true, partially because some sips are boozy coffee forward, others boozy coconut, harder to get all together with the potency, light vanilla and regular benthic notes abide behind this tug of war. Drinks cooler than it tastes though, thick, heavy and smooth as always with coffee, booze, and coconut textures are popping out"
2009,Jw13,Almighty Julius,4.65,"Definitely Julius, but more so. The look is a bit off-putting being a sort of dirty orange and completely opaque, which reminded me of one batch of Julius that was oxidized, but fortunately the beer here was fine. Smell and taste are mango, orange juice and orange pith. Finishes with a little more bitterness than julius, with no hint of the 9.4% ABV"
2010,Bachus24,Almighty Julius,5,Almost burnt orange. Clearly Julius franchise. Nice mouthfeel with a zippy sting at the end. Not boozy. Amazing beer.
2011,WickedBeer,Almighty Julius,4.65,"Bright, ripe citrus, peach, and hints of pineapple on the nose. Flavors of orange pith, fresh cut grass, and an underlying bubblegum sweetness. Richness from the malt bill drives the underlying body, finishing out alarmingly smooth and slightly bitter."
2012,JohnWesolowski,Almighty Julius,4.82,Full flavored without being too strong in any dimension. The aftertaste is exceptional.
2013,CHickman,Almighty Julius,4.52,"Pours opaque brown/orange color with a 2-3 finger thick foamy beige colored head that lasted for a few minutes and left outstanding camouflage foamy lacing coating the Teku. Smells like guava, apricot, fruity candy like Haribo gummy bears, orange peel, fresh hops, biscuit or yeast, citrus fruit and some tropical notes. Not much in the spice category with an overall fruity nose, I expected it to be more dank smelling based on it’s looks.

Tastes of tangerine, pineapple, grapefruit, apricot, fresh squeezed orange juice, wet citrus hops, guava, caramel, a sweetness like brown sugar, graham cracker, honey and faint flowery hops or floral spices as it fades. There’s a nice level of bitterness, a tangy feel overall and no sign of the ABV, which is very impressive for a triple IPA."
2014,Roguer,JJJuiceee Project - Citra + Citra + Citra,4.73,"An unsurprisingly beautiful beer in the style. Good head production and retention; very nice lacing.

Aroma is absolutely bursting with the expected citrus-forward notes of tangerine and orange, along with melon, mango, and papaya, but also a surprising amount of herbal notes (oregano, fresh basil) I normally associate closer with New Zealand hops than Citra.

Super smooth on the palate. Tree House IPAs aren't always soft and pillowy, but when they are, they present arguably the best mouthfeel in the style.

For a beer advertised as Jjjuiceee Project, it certainly delivers on the palate. This is an explosively juicy beer, primarily tropical (mango, papaya, passion fruit) along with some citrus (mandarin orange), with just enough sweetness to emphasize and reinforce these fruity notes. Very low astringency and bitterness; no noticeable expression of the herbal notes from the nose.

With as many amazing IPAs as Tree House has put out, it's easy to dismiss their beers as, ""Ehh, it's good, but it's nothing new."" This beer may indeed not be anything particularly novel, but the execution is simply so near perfection that it's hard not to be blown away. This beer tastes and feels nothing less than awesome."
2015,Sheppard,JJJuiceee Project - Citra + Citra + Citra,4.25,"Pours a yellowish orange. Mango and orange on the nose. Mango, orange, and grapefruit. Nice rounded mouthfeel in that classic Tree House fashion. Maybe lacked the depth of the Julius family but a really nice beer."
2016,ovaltine,JJJuiceee Project - Citra + Citra + Citra,4.5,"Pours a very hazy mango color that swallows light and sits under a creamy white head that coats the glass as you enjoy the beer. Beautiful hazy.

The nose is preposterously citrus laden, with loads of ripe oranges and mango, and a nice scoop of passion fruit and some sweet oats following. I like where this is headed.

The taste is all about the Citra hop flavors as represented by the juicy oranges and mango, with some passion fruit and sweet oats at the back of the palate to balance the surprising bitterness present in this juice bomb.

One note: the can references “liquid hop product called Spectrum,” which, as a curious old guy beer nerd, I naturally used the Googler to find the following information:

1. SPECTRUM® hop extract is the easy and efficient way to dry hop your beer.
2. SPECTRUM® disperses even into cold beer so it is easy to dose and dial in your recipe.
3. SPECTRUM is 100% natural and captures all delicate hop aromas. SPECTRUM is variety-specific and is available in Citra® and Mosaic® to start, but with more varieties on the way!

So us beer nerd that love Citra and Mosaic hops have THAT going for us.

The mouthfeel is full, soft, and pillowy as expected. Tree House continues to amaze me."
2017,TheIPAHunter,JJJuiceee Project - Citra + Citra + Citra,4.24,"Deep orange haze. Nose is watermelon, orange peel, and sweet florals. Taste is bubblegum, passion fruit gummies, mango, and citrus rind. Light bodied. Soft, lingering bitterness."

2020,WunderLlama,Tree Of Fortitude,4.57,"Brewers notes: Tree of Fortitude is our signature barleywine that has been aged in a variety of flavored Rum barrels between 14–20 months. It utilizes several distinct ingredients to both enhance and elevate the base beer to new, intriguing places.By implementing careful doses of vanilla, coconut, and lime, it carries flavors and aromas of sweet brown sugar, soft candied coconut, and a delightful underlying hint of lovely citrus. Once combined, these independently recognizable flavors harmonize into a pleasant blend that may just transport you to a more tropical locale. Wherever you find yourself drinking Tree of Fortitude, we hope you enjoy it in good company and in good health.

The base beer and barrels create a base that tastes primarily of creme brulee like brown sugar with a hint of caramel. The additives are all noticeable but deftly well incorporated. In descending order of prominence, vanilla, coconut, then lime. I am surprised by how well the lime works in such a sweet beer. It's subtle and maybe I'd prefer it not to be there at all but it really does work. Then again maybe I am glad it's there, it's just so unique. The body is thick and sticky sweet just other BA Tree House offerings. My glass is almost empty and I'm sad, I want to have this again."
2023,Roguer,Tree Of Fortitude,4.5,"Absolutely stunning beer that delivers waves and waves of flavor. Malt-forward and fairly sweet.

Every component comes to play, and not all at once. Vanilla, coconut, lime, rum, oak, molasses, brown sugar, salted caramel, chocolate. It's really remarkable.

The fruit is restrained enough - both the coconut and the lime - that this doesn't come across as some sort of tropical fruit beer. The malt base is dark and sweet, very stout-like, and perfectly complementary to the rum barrel treatment and flavorings.

Absolutely wonderful beer."
2024,GreesyFizeek,Tree Of Fortitude,4.21,"This one pours a dark-ish golden brown color, with a small head, and a little bit of lacing.

This smells like caramel, toasty rum, a touch of coconut, breadiness, chocolate, and toffee.

This is not adjuncted into the atmosphere by any means, and it works well because of that. On the finish, there’s just a hint of lime, more of a lime vibe than an actual lime taste, if that makes sense. It says it’s aged in flavored rum barrels, but I don’t really get that, just regular old toasty and spicy rum. There’s not really any vanilla, just a hint of a coconut, some oak, and lots of caramel and toffee.

This is medium bodied, creamy, and not too boozy.

This very well could have been a complete failure, as it’s ambitious and kinda weird. But it was successful, and well balanced."
2025,lucius10,Tree Of Fortitude,4.52,"Sweet brown sugar malty, a hint of vanilla covered raisins, and a coconut rum barrel nose on this one! Taste follows with some vanilla and caramel candy, and a balanced vanilla-coconut rum barrel boozy finish. Not much lime initially, but that is A-OK! Ha! Not the biggest fan of additions to barleywine, but this actually works! I was okay with the vanilla and coconut additions, but actually bristled at the lime. Thankfully the lime was used with a deft hand. As it warmed, some lime notes peeked out, but it wasn't intrusive or off-putting. Good Bwizzle!"

2033,papposilenus,JJjuiceee Project - Peacharine,3.75,"From a 16oz can, dated 09/21/23. Served in a spiegelau IPA glass.

Pours an opaque dull orange with a scant finger of creamy, cream-colored head. Retention is middlin’ poor, leaving a creamy collar and a rousable but slippery spattering of lacing.

Nose is fruity-yeasty but not especially robust. Aroma of peach pie and then something more like a wine cooler.

Taste is juicy without any significant bitterness. Tasting underripe peach/nectarine flesh, tangerine, lime, white wine and wood ash. There’s a bit of fusel character but otherwise a fast, clean finish. A little watery if truth be told.

Feel is clean and juicy, relatively thin bodied with fine, bright carbonation.

Overall, a mixed bag. I found the flavour to be about as interesting as an out of season supermarket peach or, more likely, the water it was washed in. Also, there was a little fusel in the aftertaste, which is a new thing in TH NEDIPA’s, I guess. OTOH, I drank the whole can so maybe I should just shut up. And you’d never guess that the abv was 8.7%, so there’s that."

2035,Holderness,JJjuiceee Project - Peacharine,4.18,"Canned 26 days ago.

L -- Pours a very opaque muted orange with a finger of off-white head produced with gentle pour. Not too much retention or lacing; a bit unusual for TH, but this has been becoming more common as they continue to wander into more hop-saturated territory
S -- Peacharine definitely lives up to its name in the aromas. Predominantly yellow peach, orange sorbet, elderflower, mango, and a lot of creaminess from the yeast and malt combination
T -- Tastes are a little more generic new-age citrus-forward hops. The peach/pale stonefruit character is maybe a little more pronounced but there is still a lot of pithy grapefruit bitterness, white grape, and some mango sorbet
F -- Fluffy and chewy. This thing has a lot of hop matter in it

Served in a tulip

The beer poured a complexly opaque and almost milky looking, yellow ochre hue. A thin, frothy, bright white crown topped the body, but it quickly dissipated. A wall of sticky, spiderweb-like lacing coated the glass.

The nose was absolutely spectacular. Super hoppy and intense yet soft and perfumey. Tropical fruits dominated. Passionfruit came through big time. Loads of Meyer lemon too. Some dank cannabis was also noticeable. Bit of guava and juicy orange as well.

The flavor profile was nearly as impressive as the aroma. Big tropical fruit presence. Passionfruit again came through strongest. Lots of citrus too. Nice mix of juicy orange flesh and zesty orange peel. Tart lemon notes appeared in the center. Touch of dankness. More citrus peel on the back end and in the finish. Some rind-like bitterness lingered after the swallow.

The mouthfeel was the only aspect of the beer that did not blow me away. It was medium bodied for the style. A touch thinner than I anticipated. The liquid contained a fine, subtle effervescence that gave the beer a nice suppleness on the palate.

Heavier Mettle Cut was one of the most unique and overall impressive hoppy beers I have tried in a very long time. It takes a lot for a DIPA to get my attention, but this one certainly did. Kudos to Trillium and Fidens for collaborating on this absolutely fantastic release."

It contains an adjusted base recipe specifically designed to balance said hop charge, with incredible stone fruit notes layered throughout the experience.

Flavor follows. It's very juicy, and the dankness is restrained but present. Milder notes of sharp green kitchen herbs. Huge tasting notes of papaya, mango, mandarin orange, ruby red grapefruit, lemon, pineapple, lemon gumdrops.

Juicy, tropical fruit-forward aroma with minimal herbal notes. A bit of a melange, with the dominant notes coming across as mango, melon, papaya, and orange.

Similar on the palate. There's a slight herbal sharpness, but the predominant notes are tropical fruit with a bit of citrus - not unlike a slightly boozy fruit salad. Slightly less prominent yeast expression than Tree House's typical IPAs. Surprising amount of bitterness (in a good way). Tasting notes include melon, mango, white grape, orange, grapefruit peel.

One of their best in terms of mouthfeel: absolutely creamy and soft, full bodied, while maintaining a noticeable bite.

From just about any other brewery, this would be among the best in their lineup. From Tree House, it's another phenomenal IPA that yet fails to standout from the rest of their massive lineup of phenomenal IPAs, both in terms of quality and flavor profile."

2062,Rug,Coco King Creamsicle,3.79,"No canning date, odd for a Tree House IPA

I haven’t had one of these fruited King Julius variants in quite some time, so I was very happy to see this one was available when I stopped in at Tree House the other day. I will say that both coconut and vanilla in a NEIPA could be overkill, but I trust that they kept it balanced. Let’s crack it open and find out

Pours a hazy dark gold with 3 fingers of creamy off white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing

The coconut definitely dominates the nose here, but thankfully the base beer is still able to shine through a bit. I’m picking up on aromas of coconut milk, cedar, vanilla bean, overripe cantaloupe, mango skin, bready malt, light grass, papaya, and pineapple juice

Unfortunately in taste the coconut starts to overwhelm the other notes, almost feeling like an overuse of Sabro hops instead of actual coconut. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting toasted coconut, woody hops, papaya, weed, bready malt, orange rind, and light pineapple juice. The swallow brings notes of woody hops, toasted coconut, vanilla bean, orange rind, bread crust, and light papaya

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a slick beer. Finishes dry and astringent

I can’t help but feel this can is slightly off or maybe just old since it’s undated. I’m disappointed but if the other can is any better I’ll update this review to reflect it"

2066,GreesyFizeek,Coco King Creamsicle,4.5,"This one pours a hazy golden yellow color, with a small head, and lots of lacing.

This smells like orange tangerine creamsicle, pineapple juice, toasted coconut, stone fruit, and creamy vanilla.

This is decadent but done quite well, with some definite added sweetness from the coconut/vanilla - but not *too much*. There’s certainly a strong creamsicle vibe here - that feeling was absolutely nailed.

This brew pours liquid black, with no carbonation what-so-ever. I'm pretty sure I can hear light screaming as it hits the brew. Nothing is getting through this. Aroma is...well, I opened the can and even being as far away as I was, the ABV smacked me on the forehead. I can detect chocolate, coconut and graham crackers. Taste is nearly all ABV, but faintly I detect chocolate and coconut. This is a thick brew and I am one that likes me a stout brew. This brew will separate the adults in the room with no questions asked. A wonderful pastry stout but be warned."

Served in a tulip
05.02.2023

The beer poured a fuller bodied, dark brown hue that approached black. A frothy, half-inch tall, mocha colored crown topped the liquid and quickly dropped to a thin collar. Eventually, the head dissolved completely and the liquid looked surprisingly oily and viscous in the glass.

The aroma was boozy and somewhat nondescript initially. Big, boozy, bourbon notes came through big time. Really malty and sweet as well. Caramel malts were most apparent. Touch of roasted malt character too. Some chocolate was also noticeable. Chocolate fudge or chocolate syrup came to mind. Touch of vanilla and brown sugar. As the beer warmed, both the chocolate and vanilla intensified and the booziness mellowed. Some coconut was also noticeable. The pecans were undetectable however.

Like the nose, the flavor profile was also super boozy. The beer literally tasted like a shot of bourbon was dropped into it. Malty up front. Caramel and roasted malt notes were apparent. Bit of chocolate fudge and vanilla in the center. The boozy bourbon notes intensified on the back end and in the finish. I definitely tasted all 14.7%.

The mouthfeel was solid but somewhat nondescript. Fuller bodied for the style. Oily and slick on the palate. The liquid contained a fine, subtle effervescence.

I usually love Prairie’s stouts, but Pecans In Paradise - Bourbon Barrel-Aged was definitely a bit of a letdown. Not only was this beer drier and boozier than their typically stouts, but the coconut was quite subtle and the pecans were completely undetectable."

2075,Roguer,Pecans In Paradise - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.2,"Not much head to speak of. Otherwise, this is a very attractive beer, and surprisingly free of floaties.

Wonderful and potent aroma, with a hint of oxidation that is probably more from the pecan and coconut. Dark and sweet, with notes of molasses, chocolate, pecan, coconut, caramel, roast, and bourbon.

Although this beer is very still in the glass, it's lively on the palate - although some of the sting is simply the alcohol heat, which is respectable (and appropriate for the ABV and barrel aging).

Tasting notes match the nose. The coconut doesn't particularly stand out, and the pecans are nearly (but not quite) lost in the mix, but the vanilla, bourbon and huge rich malt base are all prominent and delicious."
2076,NCSapiens,Pecans In Paradise - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.3,"This beer is really good, and I love pecans. That said, I find it’s missing a certain je ne se quois to make it outstanding—maybe chocolate? Still, there is a nice pillowy vanilla, delicious pecan, and a quality barrel that imparts the right amount of oak and heavy booziness. On draft the nuanced flavors of the vanilla and pecan come through more clearly than in the bottle. Another solid stout by Prarie."
2077,REVZEB,Pecans In Paradise - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.01,"Jet black body with a hint of dark brown on the horizon, head vanishes immediately. Aromas are like a baker's kitchen: pecans, coconut, chocolate, and vanilla are strong, then bourbon, molasses, caramel, and a hint of coffee. Taste is much sweeter with the coconut and vanilla running the show up front, bourbon and baker's chocolate is the next wave, finishing caramelized pecans are a weaker ending tone. Thinner body but never looses its way, good balance of the sweet adjunct textures and barrel considering the taste. Prefer others in their stout portfolio but this was ambitious and pulled it off enough to please you for dessert"

A&S: This beer has a very pretty ruby amber color. Good head when poured, off-white. Pours a little more than a half finger. hangs around with some specks in the center and a ring around the outside. Smells like a wheat-wine. More fruity than I would expect: Apricots, bananas, cantaloupe, and amaretto. Little boozy in the aroma. 

T&M: The taste has gotten a lot better as it has warmed. Sweet, but not overwhelming. You get booze and melon in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is very fizzy when poured but becomes smooth and velvety later on.

Overall: This beer was a very pleasant experience. I didn't know what to expect from this beer, but it beat my expectations. Very soft and warming characters."

Caramel, toffee, sweet malt and oak barrel in the aroma. 
Vanilla, big malt flavors of toffee, caramel, some dark/dried fruit and booze. 
All very much akin to the description provided by FW...they nailed it.
Full body with low to medium carbonation and a smooth mouthfeel. Some heat but short lived. Lengthy finish that isn't dry or sweet - there is a swirling sweetness and a bit of (maybe?) hop and the heat that keep it tamed. 
Outstanding."

2085,Victory_Sabre1973,"Double DBA - Batch 10,000 (2023)",4.41,"From a 12 oz bottle:

Upon opening the beer I get a nice bit of smoke rising from the bottle. The pour is quite a dark amber color. When I hold it to the light it's fairly clear looking. I see a cascade of carbonation bubbles rising in the glass. The head that formed is 2 finger, and light tan in color. The head retention is decent. There's a small bit of lacing on the glass as the head dissipates, but not much lacing. 
Aroma is strong with dark fruit notes. I also get some green apple notes. Tons of vanilla and caramel also shine in this beer. There's a hint of oak that also tickles my nose. 
Taste - The flavor Is a lot like the nose, though I'm not getting much green apple in the flavor, just the faintest hint on the back. I get lots of vanilla and oak in this beer. I get some caramel and toffee notes, along with some dark fruit, more plum like to me. 
There's a bit of a burn to this beer, but it's really not a harsh burn. The body overall is quite good. There's a bit of a bubbly feeling to this beer. 
Overall it's quite delicious, and a nice take on their regular DBA."

2087,micada,"Double DBA - Batch 10,000 (2023)",4.47,"Poured cellar temp to a FW branded Glencairn glass. Color is an attractive clear light amber, with a fair amount of carbonation that yields an erupt Ive head, followed by a pencil-thin ring. Aroma is subtle, so the nose goes deep into the glass for a better whiff of what to describe. There’s a subtle caramel bite along with what reminds me of an autumn yard full of wet leaves…in a good way. The flavor is crisp and dry, bringing up the caramel note, a mild malt, finished by a slight hop cleansing. The Weller profile stays quiet up front, but visits for a while once the sip is gone. Barrel wood seems to play into the dryness. As with most FW boxed series, the high ABV seems tamed and mellow, but it has a kick. First time with this one, hopefully not the last."
2088,chinchill,Juicy Tiles,3.9,"On tap at the Blue Ridge Beer Garden in NC. 

Appearance. Wow! This came with a huge frothy head over a cloudy golden straw colored body. The head left lots of lacing sticking to the glass. 

The aroma is quite dank and the aftertaste is loaded with grapefruit and suggestions of other tropical fruits. The flavor is strong and bitter for the style It has some pine, a modicum of funk, and notes of tropical fruits."

2091,Rug,Juicy Tiles,4.44,"Canned 11/21/23. ""Honey heist"" stamped on the bottom of the can

It's been a while since I've had anything from WeldWerks or Trillium. It's quite the interesting collaboration, and I'm always a sucker for honey in beers so I'm sure I'll enjoy this one. Let's crack it open and find out what it's all about

Pours a hazy orange gold with 3 fingers of soapy off white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing

The honey is present in the nose but it's rather subtle. I'm picking up on aromas of orange zest, pineapple juice, earthy hops, peach rings, overripe cantaloupe, wildflower honey, white pepper, and papaya

It's more honey-forward in taste, and it's damn delicious. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting orange juice, pineapple juice, wildflower honey, mango skin, bready malt, grassy hops, white pepper, overripe cantaloupe, papaya, and dank weed. The swallow brings notes of orange zest, pineapple juice, crackery malt, mango skin, grassy hops, orange blossom honey, dank weed, peach rings, papaya, and white pepper

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a smooth beer. Finishes mostly dry with a firm yet balanced bitterness

I enjoyed this one more than I had expected to. Truly awesome stuff"

Flavors of caramel, malt, brown sugar, figs, some cherry and raisins, spices- again, clove. Smooth, a little dry, a very good medium body, appropriately carbonated. 

Has a different flavor profile than typical for the style and it really works. It’s spicier and there seems to be some impact from the dark candy sugar. Very enjoyable."

2096,MutuelsMark,30th Anniversary Quadruple,4.75,"Super dark in color like prune juice. Not much head could be created. Nose was similar to prune juice however not offensively. Taste was dried fruit and possible raisins. Also notes of horehound candy. ABV is only evident after swallowing, the slight burn down the throat, but not overwhelming at all. Very good Quad."

2098,TheOccasionalBeer,30th Anniversary Quadruple,1.83,"Ripe banana, a hint of cotton candy or those banana-flavored bubble gum cigars, and maybe some brown sugar came out as an aroma when I popped the can open. Pouring a deep translucent mahogany into the glass yielded a vigorous and deep cafe au lait head nearly filling the glass. The scent in the glass was more brandy and lilac and banana. Smooth and slightly round at the front of my mouth, it slightly prickled my tongue and ended with a roughness going down my throat. The flavor is bitter almost sour green banana as an aftertaste. This followed a sour bitter slightly cloying cotton candy sweetness. I'll drink this one... I think. The taste is growing less palatable with every sip. Hopefully, my pizza will mask it if it gets any more pronounced. Update: I'm actually not going to finish this because it's setting off some extreme gastric distress (which I know it is the cause of). I know it's sacrilege for a Wisconsinite to say, but I've never really liked New Glarus and this isn't helping their cause."

2100,Bouleboubier,30th Anniversary Quadruple,4.42,"(12 oz can, I253 0940 R; purchased single at their Beer Depot last week... poured into my St. Bernardus goblet)

L: claret-ruby red, clear liquid; tentative tuft of fleeting foam atop... absolutely no lacing, tis a shame, but more or less on point for its ilk

S: bubble gum, brown bread dough, currant jelly... little booziness, but a clear hint of medicinal berry-pomme lozenge... bold, malty/sugary to a pleasing degree... just short of a 9; senses stunned

T: I taste for banana rum in Quads, and it's there here but in the back there I suppose... dominant candi sugar frontal; dry, dried-fruity bright up front, dried fruit in the aftertaste; cut dry, concentrated sugar sourced; parts dark rum and port wine... its alcoholic strength does much to boost the arguably short-of-iconic flavor spectrum... oh, huh, some chocolate angles do rise from the flatitudes along the way... sea of dark fruit atop which spicy sea spray simmers; the yeast is to blame and be celebrated... dense brown bread, drenched in berry brandy

F: potent, pinging the top-back of the palate; soft sultry roll on the floor, dry heat fanning it out in the finish... doesn't approach viscousness, syruprosity, but slaps against the cold, stony wall...

O: Dan seems to prefer brewing dry but with teasingly sweet artifacts, and so do I... honestly, this is real subtle adjustments from achieving what my Quad ideal has long been; on the other hand, this tastes/drinks like a fruity doppelbock... but as an American-soil Quad, done well; does NOT taste like an import (unless double-plus holiday bock is the style feelings)... yet yet another I wish I bought two or three of instead of one (2210)"

2102,brentk56,30th Anniversary Quadruple,4.41,"Appearance: Pours a clear burnt caramel color with a one finger tan head; good retention that leaves squiggles of lace

Smell: Fruity with holiday spice tones; notes of fig, raisin, brown sugar and banana mingle with clove, cinnamon and nutmeg

Taste: Fig, raisin and brown sugar forward with a hint of banana building; holiday spice tones of cinnamon, nutmeg and clove add complexity, with a touch of chocolate in the mix; the aftertaste is fruity and spicy

Mouthfeel: Medium to full body with moderate to high carbonation

Overall: This exempifies what a brewery should produce for a major anniversary beer - something complex and enjoyable both now and in the future"
2103,BEERchitect,30th Anniversary Quadruple,4.1,"When you've been legal for nine years, the palate has the opportunity to mature and leverage sophistication and complexity. And that's what New Glarus does in their 30th anniversary Belgian-styled quadruple ale does.

30th Anniversary Quadruple kicks off the celebration with a deep garnet and foggy appearance. As a billowing creamy froth builds toward the rim, the nose is struck by the strong fruitiness of tropical, dried and stone varieties. With a twinge of holiday spice and warming alcohol, the scent is bold and complex. Sweeter on the tongue, a robust malt impact seems of brown sugar, coffee cake and hard candy.

With a slow fade of sweetness, the malts continue to provide a dense pillow of maltiness throughout the session; a perfect foundation for the bold fruit profile of pineapple and banana. Complementary flavors of raisin, date, apricot and fig round out the fruitiness in anticipation for a balance of clove, cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger to give balance and complexity. Low in bitterness, the late palate is slightly bitter, allowing the spices to carry the balancing load.

Full bodied, creamy and lush, the bold beer carries greater heft than classic abbey versions along with a sweeter and fruitier tone. Warming with hints of red wine and rum as the taste wanes, the ale finishes malty-sweet with a long linger of dark fruit and holiday spice."
2104,Tsar_Riga,30th Anniversary Quadruple,4.46,"A - Pours dark, cola black-brown, with a short tan head that fades quickly. A few bits of lacing and a line of fine bubbles and a cast of a cap are all that persist.

S - The nose is a powerful blast of banana esters, with mild dark fruit and spun sugar underpinning it.

T - Open follows the nose, with banana foremost, vanilla, plum and raisin beneath, a tannic tea and spice note rising in the middle, soft but continuing through some mild acidity and ongoing sweetness as increased alcohol presence comes forward in the finish.

M - There is moderate weight, fairly light weight for a Quad, but that increases drinkability. The warm presence in the close signals the heft of this brew, which is not a beer to be trifled with.

O - I like a good Quad, and this definitely qualifies. I love this rendition, and the huge banana bread quality it delivers. Tasty, drinkable, and warm - great for a winter night."
2105,vette2006c5r,30th Anniversary Quadruple,4.26,"Pours a dark red almost brownish color, with a small fizzy head. The aroma is earthy spices and sweet cherries. Flavor is sweet and bright, earthy spices, a hint of cinnamon and cherries. Good feel. Overall a bit brighter, and fruity sweet."

Overall - Great look to this brew. It looks real juicy. The smell comes thru very easily on this one too. Wonderful scent of dank citrus and hoppy menthol, woody aromatic tones.

2122,jrc1093,Very Pink,4.03,"Canned on 6/29/23; consumed on 7/24/23

Pours a turbid, dingy gold body capped with three fingers of fluffy, eggshell-white foam; great head retention leaves over a sizeable layer of level cap, a moderate, frothy collar, and myriad spattering of sudsy lacing spread generously across the walls of the glass.

Aromas of lime bubblegum and tinges of banana peel meet a musty, resinous dank as citrus-forward undertones of orange oil each a cracked white pepper stank, leaving mango and white grape residuals on the back end of the bouquet.

Taste opens with lime sorbet and a bready malt subtext, showcasing accents of white pepper, tangerine, and hints of guava pith through the mid-palate as white grape must settles into the finish.

Mouthfeel brings a medium body and a taut, moderate carbonation; slight resins attenuate a maintained juiciness over the mid-palate before a crisp back end welcomes suggestions of bittering fading through the finish.

Well-rounded, even understated at times; a comprehensive balance of deep, fruity resins remain composed, though just shy of a higher-tier distinction for the style."
2123,dafla67,Kill The King,4.6,"Pours deep black. Aroma is wonderful combo of molasses, vanilla, bourbon, oakiness with hints of booziness, caramel, vanilla, dark fruit, chocolate and hints of coconut. Mouthfeel is medium and perfectedly matched."

2125,REVZEB,Kill The King,4.49,"Black barleywine indeed, looks like a sludgey stout. Smell is laced with bourbon, oak, vanilla, coconut, and molasses, with supporting caramel, barley, faint char, and raisin. Taste is sweeter with molasses leading the toasted caramel, raisin, and coconut then an earthy and barley wave backed by oak comes smoothly over before finished by vanillins, more coconut, bittersweet chocolate, bourbon and artful rye. Feels warm with booze, heavy and thick but silky smooth. Less sweetness would elevate an already great ale"
2126,mschrei,Kill The King,4.77,"Boozy. Sweet. Great blend of stout and Barleywine, as characteristics of both assert themselves strongly. Coconut is present in extreme, super sweet. Big barrel notes, strong alcohol on the feel. Slightly syrupy. Great beer."
2127,DokiDokiLitFam,Kill The King,4.66,"Wow. This is one of the last Anchorage brews I have in my collection, as I haven't purchased many at all recently from Tavour.

Appearance is as usual.

Nose is huge on the bourbon. This is the most bourbon forward Anchorage stout I've had. Bourbon, oak, coconut, chocolate, ethanol, roasted malt. The ethanol comes jumping out of the glass, but not in an abrasive manner, if that makes any sense. Coconut dominates on the nose. That tropical fruity richness that coconut has in great quantities. 

Taste is very much a carbon copy of the nose. Bourbon and oak up front, followed quickly by a chocolate coconut mixture that emanates a dessert quality. The booziness of this brew is apparent on the palate which is why it took me two hours to drink it. Towards the end, letting the ethanol evaporate, it mellowed out considerably and for the better. At the 1 and half hour mark it became accomodating rather than aggressive. 

Mouthfeel is like all of the others. Thick, viscous, dense, coating, enveloping, silky. 

Overall this was a fantastic Anchorage brew. Reminiscent of Blessed, but with more power behind the barrel aging. It has less nuance, but more focus and energy. I didn't get much of a Black Barleywine in here. It just seemed like an Imperial Stout through and through. But even Anchorage Barleywines are dark enough and rich enough to come close to stout territory.

I drank this while reading the ending of Brandon Sanderson's Yumi and The Nightmare Painter.

2129,zeff80,Actias Luna,4.41,"16oz can. Poured out a cloudy, golden orange color with a small, khaki-colored head of foam. It left thin rings of lace on the glass. It smelled of grapefruit, guava, peach and sweet caramel. Great tropical fruit taste with toasted caramel and a piney bitterness."
2130,mntlover,Actias Luna,4.34,"Pours a murky yellow with some orange highlights. Small white head leaves some light lace.

Aroma is nice hazy passion fruit, melon, pink grapefruit, with some dank pine resin mingled in.

Taste is fruity on the front, melon, passion fruit, moves to pink grapefruit and dank pine resin fairly quickly that lingers through out the finish. Alcohol is well hidden thought it warms a little also a touch of spiciness that emerges in the finish with the resin. Very nice interesting brew.

Mouthfeel is big medium with slightly peppy carbonation.

Overall a good hazy with a nice pine resin kick for the best of both worlds."

S: Some serious dark fruit, Port & Bourbon notes in abundance once warm 

T: Follows the nose, molasses, figs, salted plums a little caramel & vanilla with some super smooth Bourbon notes up front. Some Cola notes, along more vanilla & caramel sneak in, along with leafy hop notes, plus pleasant oaky Bourbon notes, the Char isn't a determent, really works great with the flavors blended here as this beer warms up & the run-on sentence continues. Finishes chewy with Bourbon & coke vibe, plenty of barrel presence, plus some caramel & figs

MF: Rich body, with enough smooth carbonation to push the flavor forward 

I see only remote aspects of a RIS, but this is a great offering. Thankfully, I can't remember how much I paid for this & because of that, I will say it was worth every cent!"
2138,Victory_Sabre1973,Parker’s Heritage Heavy Char Darkness,4.4,"From a 16 oz can - canned on 10/26/23

This is a pitch black pouring beer, as expected. No chance of any light shining through it. The head that formed is quite thick at 3 fingers, frothy and fluffy looking, brown in color, and very long lasting. As it dissipates, it forms a good deal of lacing on the glass. 
The nose is strong even from a far. I get lots of brown sugar notes pouring this beer, and sitting typing this. As I move in close I still get that brown sugar, but I get so much more. I get tons of dark fruit. I get vanilla, caramel and toffee. I also get a faint hint of a roasted aroma, that is quite pleasing. 
Taste - I get a whole ton of vanilla in this beer. It hits right away and lingers. I get a roasted malt flavor that also morphs into a chocolate flavor with notes of caramel and toffee. Some dark fruit hits more toward the back. The finish has a bitterness that I was getting in the base beer this year, but, the barrel mellowed the bitterness out a lot. It might be a bit much, but not crazy like the base this year. 
This is a thick and full bodied beer. Somewhat soft feeling. There's a slight burn that does kick in the end to warm my throat. 
This is way better than this year's base beer, and I'm excited to try the other BA version that I haven't tried yet."

Taste follows, quite sweet, slightly bitter, faint bourbon burn. Excellent mouthfeel, overall world-class. Aged in heavily charred 15-year bourbon barrels. Definitely allow this to warm."
2140,Taybeh,Parker’s Heritage Heavy Char Darkness,4.1,"At the brew hall, into a snifter. Not a huge bourbon drinker but this seems legit: mellow but distinctive and deep barrel notes, some roasty-toasty warmth, a hint of juicy tobacco and even more juicy chocolate. No bitterness (which, tbh, is a little disappointing) but a lot of depth. Not a ton of char that me. A little too syrupy for me to totally love. I had this side by side with the coco variant on nitro, and this wasn’t nearly as good, but it was solid."
2141,mothman,Parker’s Heritage Heavy Char Darkness,4.54,"On tap. Tan head black color. Nice lace. 

The charred barrels show. Parker’s heritage is quality bourbon and you can tell the difference in the barrel flavors. Char, roast, toasted notes. Vanilla, burnt marshmallow, fudge, chocolate, oak. Dark dried fruits. Molasses and raisins. 

Smooth, warming, full bodied. I think this is better than the 10 yr heavy char Parker’s darkness."

T - an amalgamation of bubblegum and tropical fruits. Sweet, ripe pineapple and orange sherbet. Splash of vanilla cream complements the lighter citrus flavors of satsuma and tangerine. Bright cantaloupe and strawberry kiwi smoothies. Finishes zesty and pithy, perhaps a bit hot, drying out the mouth for another sip.

F - mealy and subtly chalky. Thick, creamy, and chewy. 

O - overall a lot going on here. Tons of different flavors that can be difficult to separate out. But you know what that means... good replay value!"

T: Flavor explodes and redeems the somewhat weak nose with a salvo of coffee, medium and dark caramel, vanilla, and light oak dryness in the finish. I don't like tannins much, and this skirts right at the edge of aky and dry without the puckering quality I hate. The bourbon sweetness and heat is a great finish.

M: Dangerous feel but plenty sticky yet smooth with full body and light carbonation.

O: An excellent beer but I think I stil prefer BOMB! more."

S: Strong coffee, caramel, bourbon barrel, and vanilla. Dark chocolate. 

T: Coffee roast, dark chocolate, bourbon barrel, and roasted malts up front. Sweetens up with caramel, vanilla, and some toffee towards the middle. Finish is barrel heat, oak, char.

F: Chewy, thick mouthfeel with decent carbonation. Sticks to the tongue, some warmth in the finish.

O: Superior beer, with a hefty ABV which is well-concealed. Great flavor profile, but the mouthfeel really elevates this beer. Prairie knows stouts."
2150,JohnniEMc,Foster (IPA),4.1,"Served in a clear pint glass after being drawn from a tap, it presents a murky apricot-amber color. A tint of the color appears in the nearly perfect half-inch head created by the pour. It's obviously oat inclusive, which almost always dampens the aroma of a beer. So, for the nose, it gets oats and some muddled and vague hopping. As with an oat based brew, the body is solid. It's rich and smooth, yet somehow light and refreshing. As the liquid drains, there's some wonderful stratified glass lacing. The backbone is a one layer cereal one, just oaty. But the hop delivery is solid, bitter in an earthy way and very clean at the finish. Maybe not the best from this brewery, but way ahead of many from others."
2151,PaulyTarmac44,Foster (IPA),4.51,"Great pint, great friends, merry Christmas Happy New Year"
2152,MikeWard,Foster (IPA),4.41,"On tap at Sabatinis in Exeter pa this evening.

Splendid looking pint. Hazy yellow body with a strong white head. Superb dripping rings of lacing. Dull fruit aroma. On tasting, despite the look, this is no NE hazy. Grapefruit bitterness attacks the mouth, mixed tropical fruit balance it out. The finish is a wonderful lasting citrus bitterness. Outstanding beer. Had to have another."
2153,papposilenus,Foster (IPA),4.58,"From a 750ml growler, filled at the brewery 10/05/23. Served in a spiegelau IPA glass.

Pours a heavily hazed orange-gold with two-plus fingers of soft but sturdy, pouffy suds. Retention is epic, leaving a heavy cap of foam and a tattered curtain of fat, sticky lacing.

Nose is sharp and earthy. Aroma of oily orange peel, grapefruit peel and, like, maybe rocks, like the smell when you smash two rocks together and one breaks - I don’t know what that’s called. Minerality? Ozone? Rocks.

Taste is so similar to the nose that I could almost save myself the trouble. Grainy, sharp and crackery. Tasting bitter orange and grapefruit pith, some kiwi and lime bring a tart note to the minerality [rocks] at the finish.

Feel is clean and quenching, relatively light bodied and dry with bright, spritzy carbonation.

I think this was described as Edward’s big brother (?) and that seems about right. I’m drinking further down the abv ladder than I have been maybe for a while and so this is seeming to straddle the line between APA and IPA for me. Certainly it’s way more balanced than any IPA I’ve had lately. Anyway, tasty as the dickens and I hope it gets brewed often. Next time I’m getting a 2L fill because the 750ml wasn’t enough."
2154,Sabtos,Foster (IPA),4.5,"A uniformly suspended haze comes to near full opacity of sunrise yellow-orange under a tall and dense off-white head that leaves wavy layers of lacing.

Especially apparent after a Monkish draft, this is an exercise in balance that exhibits a more delicate flavor profile while still being fluffy and full of body. This iteration of Foster shares characteristics closer to tropical fruits with hints of kiwi accompanied by a soft shortbread malt that brings hints of vanilla whip before finishing semi-dry.

Damn, the drafts in Denver during GABF weekend are insane."
2155,brewandbbq,Foster (IPA),4.25,"16oz can dated 9/12/23.

2156,Damian,Doppio Affogato,4.71,"Drank from a 1 pint .9 fl oz (500 ml) bottle purchased at Trillium Brewing Company, Boston, MA
Served in a tulip

Shimmery, near pitch black appearance. The oily looking body was topped by a half-inch tall, super tight and creamy, saddle brown head that dropped to a thick, lasting collar. A curtain of streaky, spotty lacing coated the glass.

The aroma was outstanding. Espresso notes came through big time. Slightly roasty. Loads of vanilla as well. Fresh vanilla bean perhaps. Sweet brown sugar notes were also apparent. Bit of creamy lactose character too. The vanilla intensified as the beer warmed.

The flavor profile was nearly identical to the nose but not quite as rounded or as intense. Big espresso notes led things off. Moderately roasty. Fresh vanilla bean followed. Brown sugar notes were also apparent. Some lactose-like creaminess as well. More espresso and roasted malt character on the back end and the finish. A subtle booziness lingered after the swallow. As the beer warmed, rich chocolate notes appeared in the center.

Excellent robust, full bodied mouthfeel. Creamy, slick and smooth on the palate. The liquid contained a finely beaded, moderate effervescence that fluffed up nicely.

Affogato and Barrel-Aged Affogato are two of my all-time favorite beers in Trillium’s portfolio, but Doppio Affogato might be even better. Despite the beer’s name and ingredient list, it was surprisingly balanced. I look forward to the day when a bourbon barrel-aged version of this is released."
2157,brewandbbq,Doppio Affogato,4.45,"500ml bottle. 

Pours solid black with a short head of brown. Bakers chocolate and espresso in the nose. Full bodied with a thick, chewy mouthfeel. Chocolate cake batter with an espresso reduction on the palate. Finishes a bit sweet with a strong coffee finish."
2158,WunderLlama,Doppio Affogato,4.49,"Brewers Notes: Pouring dark black with creamy, glass-coating viscosity, Affogato leads with assertive notes of freshly baked brownies, vanilla icing, sticky toffee chocolate, and light roast coffee. Upon the first sip, vanilla bean engulfs the palate with complimentary flavors of espresso, caramelized brown sugar, molasses, and milk chocolate. Full bodied and creamy, yet soft and slightly warming, Doppio Affogato's gentle sweetness is kept in check by the roasty-coffee bitterness.

I hate to see a 10 from them, as this is just about perfectly what you'd want from a smooth dessert sipper. Very heavy vanilla tones on the nose and palate both, as expected, with rich brownie batter and maybe a hint of banana near the finish. Some roasted grain bitterness at the end which is actually welcome, cutting through some of the otherwise nearly-overwhelming sweetness."
2162,maximum12,Intrepid Observation,3.97,"OK Bottle Logic, let’s bring the better side of your house. 500ML bottle marked as Batch #1, 2023. 

The pour I’d have to call black, though I’m searching for brown or red or something to indicate this isn’t a purebred stout. Un-not-found. Nose is crushing vanilla backed by bourbon. 

Intrepid Observation is a smooth vanilla dress for your palate. Vanilla sonic boom up front is followed closely by a wave of bourbon & booze. Caramel & oak follow, but the taste profile is clipped short. Sharp. Taking this 500ML might have been a mistake. Or maybe not. 

A very good beer. With the description of how it was made I expected more depth and/or complexity, & it just didn’t show up."

This is best fully warmed. It’s more stout- like when colder, edges to a barleywine when warmed. The overall feel is more stout than barleywine. Vanilla is quite prominent and the barrels show well. Really enjoyable, although I expected maybe a little better."

As it warms, there is a vanilla bitterness that shows up and interferes with the barleywine/stout notes. The aromatics are much better than the taste here..."
2171,GreesyFizeek,In A Dream,4.39,"This one pours a fairly hazy golden yellow color, with a small head, and lots of lacing.

There’s lots of citrusy orange and mandarin on the nose, perhaps clementine if you’re feeling spicy? There’s grapefruit too, and a nice floral hop bitterness.

I’m not super familiar with Eclipse hops, but they seem to give this a very pleasant tangerine/mandarin/blood orange/who knows hop character, with a nice floral and soft piney bitterness. There’s some creamy peach and grapefruit as well.

This is light bodied, but creamy and full while remaining light on the tongue.

Tree House makes approximately 500 new IPAs a week, and honestly I want to try most of them. I don’t even like IPAs that much anymore, but Tree House is still just suplexing my tongue here."

2175,Mxsluis,Barrel Aged Midnight Toffee Stout,4.1,A very good base stout. Unfortunately too sweet. I would welcome them to try again with a little less toffee and a less sweetness.
2176,StonedTrippin,Barrel Aged Midnight Toffee Stout,3.89,"neat that this is a collaboration with angry chair, their stuff is hard to come by in these parts, but im not in love with the beer, its thick as taffy, a little forced and over flavored to me, not as natural seeming on some of the elements, perhaps a little overdone overall, with some exposed alcohol adding unneeded intensity to an already really bold drink, fun to sip on a few ounces of, but thats darn near the upper limit of this one for most mortal men i have to think. inky and viscous and leggy in the glass, seriously dense, with very little head and an oily sort of slickness to it. big vanilla in the nose, molasses and the brown sugar coming out, a lot of malt richness, concentrated maybe boiled forever, faint coconut, dark cocoa, cola, tobacco, and coffee beans, lots going on but real boozy and sweet is my main impression here, not poorly refined or anything, just colossal. the taste hits all at once, and for how big and ingredient driven it is, its kind of monotone to me, espresso and dark chocolate, the candy sugar and the brown sugar together with the sticky middle malt, vanilla all through it, chocolate fudge, subtle maple, but like its there and then its permanent, not a lot of evolution until some late onset roasty bitterness doing its best to give this some semblance of balance. sweet on the teeth, hot in the throat, heavy in the belly. definitely a wintertime beer, good without being amazing, less barrel character than anticipated but i get more and more of it as this warms. this seems kind of just huge for the sake of it, not a passion project or anything, it feels trend chasing rather and inspired and artistic, even if the overall execution is solid. is that overly critical? perhaps, but thats the vibe i get from this. a little goes a very long way, i think its a bit overrated here on BA..."
2177,Scotchboy,Barrel Aged Midnight Toffee Stout,4,"16oz can pours out midnight-black with a small ring of khaki head. Strong, sweet impressions of candi sugar, molasses, brown sugar, toffee, caramel, and dark chocolate. Vanilla pops onto the scene on the palate as a nice warming oak/spirit barrel characteristic blends with that ever-present brown sugar and toasted caramel toffee. Borderline cloying but the barrel is an excellent addition to this one, brings some warming balance and complexity to a brew that was really just sugary sweet toffee originally."

Similar flavors: brown sugar, caramel, toffee, malt, bourbon, chocolate, some oak. It’s fairly sweet. Smooth, a very good fuller body, appropriately carbonated. 

The brown sugar is too dominant, and it’s pretty sweet, but overall this is really good. The barrels are a little restrained, but effective. Well worth a purchase."
2179,MacMalt,Barrel Aged Midnight Toffee Stout,4.45,"Canned on 2/4/2023. Poured into a snifter at 61°. The color is dark walnut. The medium-mocha cap fizzed away almost immediately. Great nose featuring dark chocolate, toffee, vanilla, nutty char, and noticeable bourbon. The flavor is equally outstanding with sweet dark chocolate, brown sugar, and roasted nuts. I think the term ""toffee"" is overused but it's spot-on here. The flavor reminds me of a Heath Bar. The bourbon influence is strong but it doesn't overwhelm the other flavors. There is a slight bitter char at the finish. This Stout has a moderately thick and creamy feel with a low level of carbonation, and it's impressive how well the 14.9% ABV is hidden. It's neither hot nor obviously boozy. Overall, this Stout is a true work of art made by two breweries renowned for the style. I was thrilled to find it locally."
2180,RichardB26,Barrel Aged Midnight Toffee Stout,4.79,"2-Pack from the Minneapolis area, $8/beer. Beer was served at 40-50 degrees in a 12oz cocktail glass.

Opening the can gives a nice pop but not much carbonation release. Initial scent is coffee-like mixed with brown sugar. It does give the toffee vibes like the name suggests. The alcohol is detectable pre-pour but it isn't overpowering. 

The pour resulted in a 1cm head on top of a sea of dark chocolate with caramel colored edges. The head dissipates rather quickly and the aroma isn't as powerful as one would think. 

The first sip gives way to a moderate, but not too sweet and velvety smooth experience. The prickle from the carbonation and alcohol is miniscule. There is a slight roasted flavor, a gentle warmth despite the ABV being 14.9%, and the brown sugar makes an appearance and lingers after the swallow. The Candi Syrup flavor shows up to the party about 30 seconds after the swallow with emphasis on the syrup. At first I thought it reminded me of cough syrup but that sense went away quickly. I'm not sure which syrup they used but it is probably either the D180 or D240 Candi syrup. There is zero sediment in this beer but I wish there was. 

This beer seems to me to be in the more neutral category for imperial stouts. It's a BA but with a broadly appealing flavor profile that I think most stout lovers would enjoy. The ABV being higher means you only need 1 can to feel good and the overall beer is an enjoyable sip. This is a hit and I would buy again."
2181,ovaltine,More Jasper Than All Jasper,4.42,"Pours a hazy, almost turbid straw color with a creamy white head that grips the glass. Gorgeous hazy. The nose is led by ripe orange notes, some peach, and a nice lychee note. Dank!!!

The taste is also quite dank, with the ripe orange and peach flavors most prominent and absolutely delicious, with some lychee mid-palate and a really nice sweet oat finish. 

The mouthfeel is substantial and very soft, per the style. This is really well executed and more than worthy of both of these excellent breweries (Other Half and Fidens)."
2182,lucius10,Curiosity One Hundred Thirty Two,4.49,"Sweet tropical hoppy, stonefruity peachy, slightly malty, and an earthy-citrus nose on this one! Taste follows with a tropical hoppy, sweet ripe peach, and a subdued citrus bitter finish. This is nice and soft on the palate and is such an easy-drinker. The hoppy bitter bite is more subtle on this one, but it works well with the peacharine hops here. This is really good!"

This is orange zest with an undercurrent of strawberry and banana. Some grapefruit peel as well. A rare New England IPA that has some complexity. Really enjoy this one."
2186,Bluerabbitbell,Barrel Aged Imperial Amber Lager,4.5,"12/28/23 On tap at Great Lakes Brewing.... Special Christmas gift trip with DW.

First BA lager!

Looks... Beautiful, dark brown. Reminds me of the color of a strong Belgian ale!

Not a whole lot in the aroma, may get more as it warms up, but definitely getting some anise and dried cherry. Yep... As it warms, getting caramel, spice, and bourbon.

The taste is surprisingly good... The flavors light up on the tongue right away!..for a lager! Bright and spicy, this is definitely reminiscent of a Belgian! Deep alspice, caramel, bready, toffee, dried fruits-especially cherry, and bourbon alcohol burn.


We are stunned by the goodness of this!

Is this the best beer we've had? Possibly..... At least one of them."
2187,VABA,Barrel Aged Imperial Amber Lager,4.25,"Pours a very nice clear reddish amber color with a slight head and little lacing

A light bodied decently carbonated beer
A good bourbon aged lager"
2188,JayQue,Barrel Aged Imperial Amber Lager,4,"Good strong lager!! Light, crisp body but a powerful bourbon barrel flavored punch!!!! Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass, this beer was a beautiful clear very dark amber color with a lot of golden light coming through. The head was small, fizzy light cream color that appeared and disappeared quickly. No lacing. Pretty typical for a strong beer. Aroma and taste were dominated by the bourbon barrel flavoring. Not much else up front, but as you get used to it, some caramel and vanilla are also present. Mouthfeel was light and somewhat crisp as you would expect with a lager, but the bourbon barrel flavoring and the slight alcohol bite give this beer more body up front until the taste buds adjust to the flavoring. A slow sipper to be sure, but I had it with a steak dinner and enjoyed it just as much."
2189,cwm51662,Barrel Aged Imperial Amber Lager,4.28,"Man, there are a lot of layers to this! Bourbon definitely, bitter caramel, vanilla after. I can't argue with the lovers here. Not quite barleywine to me, but darn close."

A lot of oak aroma. I get toasted caramel with hints of vanilla and some booze.

Caramel and vanilla followed by dry oak flavor. Toffee with some brown sugar and hints of molasses. Booze.

2194,Damian,Two Hundred Thousand Trillion (2023),4.65,"Drank from a 1 pint can purchased at Trillium Brewing Company, Boston, MA
03/15/23
Served in a tulip

Solid appearance. The beer poured a fuller bodied, yellow-orange hue that looked very similar to Tropicana orange juice. A small, creamy white head rose above the body, but it quickly broke apart. After a few minutes, a dollop of froth sat in the center of the liquid and a fine collar encircled it.

The aroma was impressive. Tropical fruit notes dominated. Really juicy and dank. Loads of ripe pineapple and mango. Good dose of passionfruit too. Subtle lime notes were detectable as well. Not sure I would pick out the guava however. Beneath all the fruit additions was a fantastic base beer that was led by dank, mosaic hop notes. As the liquid warmed, the fruit presence mellowed and the hops intensified.

The flavor profile was similar to the nose but perhaps even punchier and more fruit forward. Pineapple came through big time on the front end. Juicy mango and passionfruit notes were apparent as well. The beer was anchored by a dank, mosaic hop base. Pink grapefruit appeared as the beer moved along the palate and intensified on the back end. The beer finished with a zesty lime kick. Overall, nicely balance between sweet and tart.

The mouthfeel was very solid. It was medium bodied for the style and contained a fine, moderate effervescence that turned creamy, slick and smooth on the palate.

Many fruit-infused IPAs seem like a novelty, but Two Hundred Thousand Trillion was impressive in every regard. With this beer, the fruits merely provided an accent to an already terrific double IPA. I would gladly drink this again, especially when the warmer weather months arrive."

2197,TheManiacalOne,Two Hundred Thousand Trillion (2023),4.5,"Poured on 4/2/2023 from a 16oz can into a US tumbler pint glass.

A: The beer is a very hazy deep yellowish gold color, with a short white head that fades slowly and leaves a thin lace on the glass.

S: The aroma contains strong grassy and dank hops, strong juicy citrus and tropical fruit, caramelized malts.

T: The taste likewise starts out with a strong grassy and dank hops bitterness that is quickly followed by a strong juicy citrus and tropical fruit sweetness. The malt character is hearty but not too heavy and brings a very good balance. The after-taste is slightly hoppy and slightly sweet. 

M: Very crisp and very smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is slightly sticky.

O: Very tasty, goes down quite easy, not too filling, strong kick, very good representation of style. This is an excellent DNEIPA to drink for a long time."
2198,GreesyFizeek,Tree of Possibility,4.57,"This one pours a very dark brown color, with a small head, and a little bit of lacing.

This smells like rich sweet caramel, brown sugar, breadiness, molasses, bourbon, oak, and vanilla.

This is absolutely stupendous, and one of the best Tree House barrel aged beers yet. It’s super well balanced and constructed, with the vanilla and oakiness of the barrel dovetailing seamlessly into the luscious barleywine base. There’s dried dark fruit, tobacco, caramel, molasses, honey drizzled on dark bread, and chocolate.

This is medium bodied, pretty creamy, and quite rich, with very little booziness.

I’ve been absolutely in love with most of what Tree House has been putting out lately. This is a bit of a stunner."
2199,Roguer,Tree of Possibility,4.6,"Modest head production, quickly fading into essentially nothing. Body is apparently clear and dark brown. Lacing is spotty at best.

Aroma is potent and inviting, prominently featuring the bourbon influence without losing sight of the huge malt base. Notes of leather, toffee, caramel, vanilla, bark, bourbon, vanilla, oak, molasses, chocolate, and dark fruit. The oak really shines, in particular.

Immediately and unbelievably rich and thick on the palate, nearly syrupy. Hot but easy enough to savor and chew.

Notes of brown sugar, pecan, bourbon, vanilla, prune, raisin, chocolate, cherry, grape. Definitely on the sweeter side; very much EBW/BBW style, focusing much more on the malt than the hops, which are there mostly for balance, although they do contribute to some pine and leather flavors.

Absolutely phenomenal barleywine, one that frankly dances the line between BW and stout."
2200,drdiesel9483,Tree of Possibility,4.6,"Look - black and thick with slight tan head great rimming and lacing
Smell - dark chocolate fudge with grape in the back
Taste - same as smell with brown sugar lots of barrel
Feel - full body light carb creamy
Overall - complex and outstanding"
2201,SpeedwayJim,Tree of Possibility,4.12,"500ml waxed and capped bottle into a Tree House wine glass. 

Pours almost flat. Dark mahogany. Thick, oily, almost filmy legs that don't go away. No head or lace. Nose is booze, brown sugar, and molasses. Hints of raisin and prunes too. Sugary, hot, but well integrated. Beer opens brown sugar, molasses and breakfast syrup. More brown sugar and a touch of dried dark fruit tartness. Super sweet. Oak, tobacco, and custard in the finish. Body is full with little to no carbonation. Thick and chewy on the palate and goes down warm and sticky. Long, lingering aftertaste. 

If there's such a thing as too thick, this is it. Flavor is great and so is the barrel presence but the fact that I can almost chew on this beer takes a bit away from it."
2202,Holderness,Tree of Possibility,4.08,"L -- Deep tawny brown with lots of viscosity. Looks still in the glass
S -- Caramel, butterscotch, toffee, bourbon, fig, prune, raisin, chocolate liqueur, maple
T -- Equal balance of milk chocolate syrup and caramel/butterscotch. Hints of apple juice, bourbon barrel, and tobacco leaf, but honestly not much
F -- Thick, chewy, and syrupy
O -- A sweet and assertive barleywine that leans much more towards the caramel side of things than I'm used to. Not sure I'd say it's ""standout"" relative to the other Tree House BWs I've had, but it's pretty good

2203,thebeers,Tree of Possibility,4.16,"Dark brown with a reddish hue and no head to speak of. Tons of caramel, fig, toffee and vanilla in the nose; a little chocolate, too. They all carry to the taste with a little marzipan added. Obviously very sweet, but with just enough earthy hops and leather in the distant background that the diabetes doesn’t set in until the third sip. Some warming alcohol in the finish. Sticky, medium-plus-bodied feel with some carbonation sneaking through. Delicious, but pure caramel candy."

2205,brewandbbq,Nothing For Granted,4.3,"On tap in Tewksbury.

Presents cloudy gold with decent retention and lacing. Pretty standard mix of orange, peach, mango. Fluffy, soft mouthfeel. Another TH banger!"
2206,Smakawhat,Silk,4.46,"Poured from the can into a Spiegelau IPA glass.

Turbid and custard yellow solid body, slightly hinting green as well. Bright rich tall four finger booming head, with thick staying power, and light white colored coating lacing to boot. Spider and crackling lace as it settle to leave a thick rich white cap.

Booming aroma. Big earthy tones and a real white peach like flavor that nearly senses fuzzy. Muted citrus, but also a real thick malt flour note that seems like a dense bread loaf hitting you over the head. Quite an impressive nose here.

Ridiculous palate. Thick bodied, almost milkshake like but without syrupy tones, but with an excellent sweetness. The palate seems to accent an almost milkshake IPA quality, with rich vanilla and excellent fruit touches of orange citrus, pineapple, and a bursting bitter pine that cuts the sweet angles like hot butter. Minty finishing to add excellent accentuated qualities to the flavors. 

Just a great bold and bursting double."
2207,Roguer,Silk,4.1,"Perhaps one of the more run of the mill IIPAs I’ve had from Tree House. Very herbal edge that detracts from the juiciness without benefiting in complexity. Slightly astringent. Flavor profile is mostly a tropical and citrus melange.

Mouthfeel is a definite standout. For a brewery famous for smooth creamy IPAs, this one is exceptional."

2212,nizzle8287,Electric Dino Boogie,5,"I usually use a glass, but this beer is so good that I have been drinking straight from the can. When I did use a glass, the look was like a hazy mango juice sort of look, with a bubbly white head that leaves lots of lacing. Smell is definite citrus and floral hops, light bread, and very slight table-sugar sweetness. Taste follows smell, with citrus, a bit of pine, booze, bread, but not as sweet as the smell would suggest which I really enjoy. Feel is perfectly carbonated, fairly light for being 7.8 percent abv, and there is a long-lasting bitter aftertaste that is just perfect. Overall, Under-rated beer 100%. I like it just as much as the King Sue and the Pseudo Sue. I will have more of this for sure!"

A: Pours somewhat hazy golden amber with a frothy off white head that settles to a frim layer and leaves a little nice lacing.

T: Tropical and stone fruit, peach, apricot, mango, pineapple, and passion fruit, citrus, tangerine and a hint of lime, a little resinous pine, biscuity slightly bready malt, and caramel sweetness. A hint of alcohol can poke through at times, which is odd for a 7.8%er. 

M: A touch on the fuller side of medium body, moderate carbonation, soft on the palate, a bit chewy. 

O: Solid, it'll be a juicy crowd pleaser that straddles the Imperial line, but if I'm being honest, it's also doesn't really stand out in the crowd of NEIPAs, making it kinda forgettable."

2220,BEERchitect,Nepo Baby,4.1,"Everyone gets a start somewhere, even dinosaurs. Looking as a prequel to the Sues of Toppling Goliath, this Riwaka, Strata and Nelson fed baby gets their start with these supporting hops.

Like a lot of Toppling Goliath's New England-styled IPA, Nepo Baby hits the glass with a pale and turbid taupe pour. As its froth eggshell froth swells to the rim, the radiant scent of tropical fruit, citrus, herb, stone fruit and vinous notes are greeted with curious grasses, herbs and evergreens. Sweeter in taste, the early malt impressions are doughy with cereal, cookie dough and honey.

With the sweetness stewing about on the middle palate, the addition of hop flavor gives the session a burst of passionfruit, grapefruit, orange and white grape. Under ripened mango, lemon, papaya, pawpaw and apricot all lend supporting flavors before the session turns to a balancing bitterness of peppery grasses, cannabis, geranium and verbena with a sprucy, balsa-like bite.

Medium bodied and fuller to start, the session makes a quick transition from creamy cereal flavor to crisp and peppery resins to dry the session in the end. A final drift of tropical fruit peels, spruce tips and hemp chase the session into a medium long afterglow."
2221,ovaltine,Nepo Baby,4.25,"Pours a very hazy pineapple color with a fluffy off white head that provides a decent amount of lacing. The nose is filled with tropical fruit notes, including passion fruit, mango, pineapple, and grapefruit, with some strawberry, melon, and white grape for good measure. Lots going on here.

The taste features the white grape, passion fruit, mango, grapefruit, and strawberry flavors most prominently, with a bit of melon and some oat sweetness at the back of the palate, providing a softer, slightly creamy finish. 

Again, there’s a lot going on here, but it works well, especially if you like tropical juice bombs. Not something to stand in line for, but it will scratch your hazy itch."
2222,tekstr1der,Velvet,4.89,"I reserve the right to believe there could possibly be a slightly better NEIPA brewed at some future date, but I'm gonna just say I think this just took the crown from both King J, and JJJulius, my former (as of today) faves. Holy smokes is this just about perfect for my taste buds and mouthfeel. Dense, chewy, delicate flavors. I can want for nothing."
2223,TheDoctor,Velvet,4.13,"Serving: On tap at Deerfield 
Consumed: Aug-10-2023

Pale yellow and hazy with meh-ish head for TH probably decent head for other breweries, though. Smell and flavor are slightly astringent, slightly fruity, slightly piney, slightly chalky. The mouthfeel follows suit. None are to the point of being bad, but it lacks the roundness and softness and peachiness that I was expecting. A void in place of the rich fruity wall of fluff present in most of their beers. All that said, I liked it pretty well and it especially improved as it warmed. After a while the character on the whole shifted from the skin, fuzz, stem and pit of the peach to the flesh, but the esters were sadly absent and the nose lead my expectations to a place that the flavor never quite delivered on. Might just be how one or more of the hops (peacharine, pink and nectaron) behave.

2228,2beerdogs,Mother of All Bricks,4.45,"Thanks to CarolinaCardinals for this absolute treasure.
Pours a deep dark walnut to mahogany hue with a khaki colored head that rises a finger in height and then settles to a fairly solid ring.
The nose flows with deep notes of toffee, dates, and the most sublimely light handed charred caramel and whiskey barrel hints.
Taste begins with a smooth vanilla tinged toffee, chewy medjool date, and then turns straight to a gracefully warm bourbon note that carries warm sweet notes and some silky char. Hints of light buttery almond, apple, and pear also can be gleaned from this profoundly rich barleywine. But all of this is delivered in a richer, ""darker"", uber-barleywine. 
The mouthfeel is fuller than typical but the heft carries the load impeccably. The warmth is present but definitely not over the top. And the smooth finish is elegant.
Overall, this should be a collaboration on a yearly basis."
2229,Sabtos,Mother of All Bricks,4.46,"Glossy mahogany nearing black with a thin tan head that quickly disperses to some wisps and an unevenly short ridge.

Nose is a marvelous blend of barrel, dark fruit, coffee and vanilla.

Taste follows nose except all flavors are deeper in intensity. The barrel is present and forward, but as is the case with many Jackie O’s barleywines there is little or no alcohol burn. Just sweet and boozy comporting with the style.

Light carbonation keeps the mouthfeel pleasant and the body is luxurious and mouth coating.

This beer presses most of my happy buttons. Hopefully it will become an annual collaboration"

Beer poured dark brown with a nice tan head.

Nose is a lovely bouquet of dark fruits, vanilla, and bourbon.

Taste is fantastic as the malt base gives me some brown sugar and figs along with notes of vanilla and a light char from the barrel. Finishes with a nice taste of the barrel that balances this beast out nicely and leaves a trace of trailing warmth.

Mouthfeel is medium bodied and silky smooth.

Overall a fantastic tasting EBW, glad i have the opportunity to try!"
2232,Beersnake,Mother of All Bricks,4.49,"Poured at fridge temp. Pours a gorgeous dark brown with very minimal head. The nose is utterly fantastic. Sweet toffee, huge notes of bourbon, vanilla, oatmeal cookies, brown sugar, and a hint of molasses.

The taste...oh the taste. Definitely reminds me of MoaS from Pelican. Dominated by sweet bourbon and sticky toffee. Perfectly orchestrated. There are nice layers of bread, dark fruit, and even a hint of bitter oak. Burnt toffee, caramelized sugar, and maple brown sugar oatmeal. Lovely. 

The mouthfeel is medium bodied and the aftertaste is bourbon and toffee. Great barleywine!"
2233,DIM,Mother of All Bricks,4.7,"The depth in this one is incredible. Up front are dried fruits like figs and raisins primarily with lesser notes of apricot and maybe a little transparent apple. These flavors deepen and intensify into the finish which adds molasses, creme brulee, concentrated vanilla, and more faintly, cocoa, bitter oak, and strongly roasted nuts. The bourbon blanketing everything is not shy but also marvelously well incorporated. What a gem!"
2234,Darkmagus82,Your Most Cherished Future Memories Are Happening Right Now,4.34,"Poured from a can into a teku glass 
Appearance – The beer pours hazed orange juice color with a big rocky head of white foam. The head has an amazing level of retention, fading slowly over time and leaving a ton of foamy lace on the sides of the glass. 
Smell – The aroma is heavy of a peach and apricot along with strong aromas of ruby red grapefruit and orange juice. Other aromas of melon and pineapple and a bit of yeast, along well as some pine and herbal notes round out the aroma nicely, producing a quite inviting smell.
Taste – The taste starts out with a sweeter orange juice and tangerine taste paired with a big sweet grapefruit hop flavor. Along with these tastes comes a bready malt flavor mixed with some other fruit flavors of apricot and pear. As the taste advances there comes a bit of a hop increase, with some light herbal and floral hops joining in. Toward the end of the taste transition, comes a bit of earth and hay, and with a slight amping up of the citrus tastes, one is left with a citrusy and nicely hopped taste to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is very thick and chewy with a moderate level of carbonation. For the flavors and the style, the feel is spot on, making this a dangerously easy drinking and flavorful brew.
Overall - Another great brew by Tree House. This one is a bit on the sweeter side, but is quite flavorful and balanced, making for a very enjoyable drinker."

2240,edthehead,Elaborative #7,4.53,"Black oily appearance, slight tan head, no lacing. Bourbon and cognac with bourbon taking most of the stage, accompanied by vanilla, and subtle chocolate notes. Medium body and carbonation, smoother than its Elaborative 6 counterpart."
2241,GreesyFizeek,Elaborative #7,3.96,"This one pours a very dark black color, with a small head, and not much lacing.

This smells quite “cakey” with vanilla frosting, sweet caramel, dark fruit and berries, cognac, and milk chocolate.

This is pretty solid, but it’s absolutely the most sludgy, pastry-like, and sweet stout that I’ve had from Hill Farmstead – a brewery that is more known for nimbler, roastier type stouts. This reminds me of a less successful take on Mikkeller’s BA Vanilla Shake. The vanilla notes here are very sweet, and very frosting like – or maybe vanilla coffee creamer. No matter how you describe it, the vanilla adds some big sweetness to an already sweet base stout. There’s some dark fruit, caramel, and lots of milk chocolate.

This is medium bodied, creamy, with no real booziness to it.

I still enjoyed this, but it was a little messy for a brewery known more for elegance in their beers."
2242,Holderness,Elaborative #7,4.17,"Tried blind alongside Elaborative 6. The two are surprisingly similar and my partner guessed that this one was Elaborative 6. Both are the sweetest stouts I've had to date from HF. The nose is spirits-forward (more bourbon than cognac) with rich milk chocolate, vanilla frosting, espresso, and dried dark fruit. Flavors are sweet and chocolatey. The vanilla treatment makes it seem even sweeter than E6 despite being the same base beer. Mouthfeel is quite thin for the style, with moderate carbonation. Overall quite delicious albeit a bit pricey

2245,GreesyFizeek,Aaron (Double Barrel Bourbon/Cognac),4.64,"This one pours a dark brown-ish color, with a small head, and a little bit of lacing.

This smells like dusty chocolate, dark fruit, lots of caramel, molasses, brown sugar, oak, bourbon, and maple.

The first Double Barrel Aaron – that one was bourbon and port – was a little bit better than this one. However, this is still phenomenal, with just loads of interesting barrel character. There’s oak, some chocolate and tobacco, caramel, and a bit of dark fruit. There’s just so much sticky malty goodness here, caramelized sugar, brown sugar, maple, and toffee.

This is medium bodied, not very boozy with a great drinkability for the style.

Aaron was one of the first “big” beers I ever had from Hill Farmstead, so I always enjoy revisiting any version of it."

2248,Jw13,Liquid Green,4.66,"Fin the description, this should be a hopped-up version of Green, using liquid Galaxy. So I'm comparing it side-by-side with Gggreennn.

It pours a bit darker than Gggreennn, leaning towards light orange compared to the more yellow Gggreennn, but apart from that the two beers look very similar. The nose is very similar too. LG sometimes appears a little more vegetal than Ggg, but that comes and goes - there's really very little to choose between them.

LG is a more bitter than Ggg - actually it seems slightly ""bigger"" all round, and maybe a touch more ""raw"". LG is also more heavily carbonated. Ggg feels a little more polished somehow. A lot of this might well be because the LG is very fresh - the canning date is only five days ago - whereas the Ggg is about 4 weeks old. 

The mouthfeel is one area where Ggg is definitely superior. While Ggg feels soft and almost creamy, LG feels a little less uniform somehow, as if it's a mixture of two liquids of slightly different viscosities. The higher carbonation seems to emphasize this. 

Overall, it's an excellent beer, and I'll be interested to see if giving it another week to mellow out will improve it further. 

After the slight disappointment of Sphere, with Liquid Green Treehouse hits it out of the park. While I still prefer Gggreennn, it's very close, and I'll be very happy if this becomes a regular brew."
2249,BEERchitect,Liquid Green,4.56,"Never simply settling for greatness, TreeHouse hopes to up the ante of Green with liquid Galaxy hop lupulin to elevate the unique tropical and vinous qualities of the ale through these unique hop technologies.

Extra pulpy, densely gold and caught in a pastel depth with a matte finish, the off-pudding pour releases a dense swath of ivory foam for a richly situated session. But then its juicy, tantalizing and irresistible fruit aromas spring forth with the vibrancy of exotic citrus, berry and tropical fruits but with its own curious herbaceous bouquet. Creamy, surly and tangy in taste, the fructose-laden initial flavors offer a near fruity tartness that evokes teeth-churning behavior in the very first sip.

And as the taste blooms across the middle palate, its fruity secrets are revealed. Bready sweetness begins to drift while the tropical fruits rise to the forefront with pineapple, mango, apricot and valencia orange. With full hoppy saturation mounting on the tastebuds, the acidity of ripe passionfruit, grape, lime and grape turn to a dry sherbet flavor for complexity and charm. Not to be outdone, the smooth bitterness shares sharply acidic tones with an undertow of green tea, fresh grass clippings and cannabis.

Working both the creamy and dry segments in mouthfeel, the beer remains juicy while trending crisp, clean and juicy with pine resinous. Finishing with a sappy-sweetness, the beer's overwhelming hop complexity seduces the palate and easily makes the tastebuds forget about the preferred bone-dry character of IPA of the paste."
2250,brewme,Liquid Green,4,"Had a single draft at Tree House in Sandwich for eight dollars. My three hundred and twenty fourth brew reviewed from these guys. This is fine, but not an improvement of the OG."
2251,tigg924,Liquid Green,4.14,"Pours ultra hazy, gold in color with one quarter inch head. Taste is big oily, piney hops with pineapple and kiwi. Heavy body, moderate carbonation, bitter. It is kinda like a slick, west coast Green. Can really tasty the oil. Good beer but not an improvement on the original classic."

Pours a mostly opaque dark brown, with a one and a half inch foamy head and a good amount of foamy lacing. Aromas of cinnamon, light apple brandy- more as it warms, some chocolate and vanilla, other spices- maybe allspice and nutmeg. Similar flavors: cinnamon, malt, apple brandy- again, more as it warms, some vanilla, light chocolate and oak, other spices- allspice and clove, for two. Smooth, a very good fuller body, well carbonated.

The brandy barrels and the other add- ins are really well blended with the solid base beer. Best fully warmed. Very enjoyable."

Absolutely delicious nose. Hints of apple and cinnamon, but not too heavy. 

Awesome flavor. Stout base, but not too thick. I really got the apple and cinnamon, in a great not sweet way. 

Outstanding. Worth finding!"
2254,Mdog,Spiced Imperial Stout Barrel-Aged,3.75,"Appearance: Dark brown, ok head.

Smell: Very bright apple brandy nose, but not boozy.

Taste: Sweet, then a ton of sweetened cinnamon. Maybe a little chocolate underneath, but the cinnamon hits front and center. Maybe a bit of boozy apple later. Not super heavy or coating.

Overall: From the mixed 6 pack of barrel-aged stouts. This Spiced Imperial Stout in apple brandy barrels is definitely spiced with cinnamon. Quite sweet and a little one-note, but it's ok."

2256,Ozzylizard,Spiced Imperial Stout Barrel-Aged,3.43,"Spiced Imperial Stout – from Boulevard. Mixed six-pack of three barrel-aged brews, limited release for 2023. Picked up at Franklin Beer, Franklin, PA on 08/12/23 for $23.00/six-pack (Including tax, $ 0.319/fl oz. Reviewed 21/12/23 (Review 3199). Note that I use DD/MM/YY protocol.
Stamped on label “PLEASE ENJOY BY 28AUG2025”. Stored at 34 degrees at home. Served at 57.2 degrees F in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. The final temperature was 61.8 degrees F. 
Appearance – 4.
First pour – Medium Amber (SRM 12), slight haze.
Body – Amber Brown (SRM 18), opaque. Under direct light, same with a few large lumps of precipitate. When rear-lit, slight light penetration at the edges, amber. There is distinct chill haze.
Head: Average (Maximum one cm, aggressive center pour), bone, high density with rocks on top, short retention, dropping to a 0.2 cm crown, and a thin, rocky island.
Lacing – Good. Wide band of near-microscopic bubbles.
Aroma – 3.5 – Weak nutmeg. No malt, no yeast, no hops, no alcohol (15 % ABV as marked on the label).
Flavor – 3 – Moderately sweet but ethanol burn overpowers any flavor. No yeast, no malt, no hops. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl. Painful gastric burning. 
Palate – 4 – Medium; smooth and creamy; soft carbonation.
Final impression and summation: 3.75 Harsh alcohol burn cremates any flavor other than the sweetness. Let this one age a year or three, or wait to the “Enjoy by” date to drink it."
2257,Harrison8,Spiced Imperial Stout Barrel-Aged,4.06,"Pours black with two fingers of khaki foam. Oily legs cling to the glass, foreshadowing a heavy, boozy beer. Aroma is nutmeg, cinnamon, and sharp spice preceding roasty and toasty malts. Apple brandy underneath adds some alcoholic heat, and additional sweetness. Flavor profile is spices out front again, with chocolate just behind. Transition feels a little weird, but not off-putting. Roasty and toasty malts sandwich apple brandy. Spices and apple brandy are less potent than the nose. Mouth feel is thick. Very light, uneven silty texture. Overall, apple brandy and spices are the star. Some of the stout notes feel a little wonky paired with the spices, but otherwise it's solid. Possibly the best part of this one is the balance is just good enough to mask the 15% ABV, though it still is evident this one is boozy from first whiff to last sip.

Served in a 12oz snifter from a 12oz bottle. Reviewed from notes."
2258,sjrider,Spiced Imperial Stout Barrel-Aged,4.31,Bottle pour - got the dark body with short mocha head leaving minimal lacing. Nose is on par with spiced cider with an appely overtone. Taste kicks up the spice level and the sweetness. A festive quaff for the season.
2259,Phoodcritic,Spiced Imperial Stout Barrel-Aged,4.09,Nice flavor; a bit too effervescent for a big stout. Aroma and taste improved considerably as it warmed from the fridge to room temperature.
2260,Beginner2,Spiced Imperial Stout Barrel-Aged,4.18,"Another of the Limited Release Brewers Choice series whose serious following has reviewed this plenty in less than 2 months. Perhaps I've been missing something. But, maybe not. At my advanced age, high-ABV brews are two or three night affairs and that requires long attention spans that, just so you know, I consider work. There also is the added disincentive that I prefer to eat my dessert instead of drink it. (But I admit, it is easier to buy a high ABV bottle that find a good dessert.) Snark aside, aspects of this Boulevard brew are masterful.

Looks are inviting: generous initial foam followed by hazel/pecan highlights on a dark body. Smells are full fruit with apple prominent, but the ABV belies problems within. Suffering the same ABV excess, Tastes try to be balanced but struggle to succeed... yet ultimately they do, mostly because the spicing reminds us that this is the season to be merry. The alcohol keeps me from Feeling this brew with my palate and instead my head Feels it.

I'm a big fan of how D-M smartly encourages its subsidiaries to grow and serve their specific niches. Compared to my D-M favorites Ommegang and A'Chouffe, I've paid too little attention to Boulevard. Yet they also are mostly Belgian-inspired; but Boulevard's barrel line proves their excellence also is diverse. All this praise explains my high Overall Hugs.

12/2/23 Had the middle nightcap of three and this second was somewhat less assertive. I've edited the review above, but didn't change the rating as the high ABV still interferes and seems like more of a thrill master than the true brewmaster I consider Boulevard to be. I got two Spiced IS in Boulevard's BA 6-pack (along with 2 other Boulevard BA creations.) I gave the second copy of Spiced IS to my nephew for helping with holiday decorations. I should have told him to let this brew mellow for two years. On the other hand, that advice would have fallen deaf on the kid's ears. But if you ever get one copy of Spiced IS, let it mellow. Cheers !

12/3/23 My report on the third and final nightcap is that it is slightly more mellower, but is losing some character as an ale. So best to let this creation mellow itself out."
2261,Scotchboy,Spiced Imperial Stout Barrel-Aged,4.24,"Another impressive barrel-aged offering from Boulevard; pours dark brown and sits black in the glass with a small khaki head. The brandy barrel is apparent on the nose and palate, along with a complimentary smattering of spices...boozy notes of apple and oak, chocolate and vanilla, strong and rich but hiding the 15% abv as well as it can."
2262,donspublic,Spiced Imperial Stout Barrel-Aged,4.25,"Poured from bottle into tulip, massive 2+ finger dark tan head, great retention and lacing. Jet black in the glass, no light passes thru. Roasted malt, apple and cinnamon on the nose. Taste follows the nose, big apple brandy on the front mixing with chocolate and roasted malt, the chocolate carries thru to the middle with a nice shot of cinnamon. Residual cinnamon and chocolate on the palate. Nice job, roast is there but carries a back seat and lets the apple brandy, chocolate notes and cinnamon shine. Hides its 15% quite well"
2263,whynot44,Spiced Imperial Stout Barrel-Aged,4.44,"Opaque black with ruby highlights and a modest but long lasting khaki head and plenty of nice lacing. 
The aroma is dark roasted malt, apple brandy and cinnamon.

2267,Oktoberfest,Spiced Imperial Stout Barrel-Aged,4.48,Very sweet with huge notes of cinnamon. Somehow this 15% ABV shillelagh only set me back $3.85 for the 12 oz bottle. I fear I'll need to return for more to see if the others in the series are just as good.
2268,LiquidAmber,Spiced Imperial Stout Barrel-Aged,4.33,"Poured into a Fremont small snifter. Pours a very dark mahogany brown with a reddish tint while pouring, appearing opaque in the glass with a half finger dark khaki head with great retention and solid lacing, looks nice. Aroma of dark toasted malt, cinnamon, ginger and apple brandy. Flavor is dark toasted malt, apple brandy, cinnamon and a touch of clove. Spiced apple pie and brandy finish. Medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess. Of the three stouts in the mixed pack, this one didn’t get me that excited as I'm leaning away from dessert stouts these days. However, this is very nicely done, with a malt body that somewhat resembles a blended American strong ale than a straight stout; the apple brandy component gives nice barleywine-like flavors. In fact, this fits a dessert stout profile, tasting like eating a piece of apple pie with brandy shots. Slightly sweet, but not sugary, like a good apple pie. The body feels a little thin for size of this stout, but supports the flavors well. Liked this a lot and glad I have another bottle for later. Enough flavor complexity to require careful sipping due to its big ABV. Nicely done."
2269,MattDecker,Spiced Imperial Stout Barrel-Aged,4.55,"Look: Deep brown, thin tan head 
Smell: apple pie, cinnamon, 
Taste: Cinnamon apple, fig, I get apple brandy on the very backend, little oaky, there is an initial cinnamon apple sweetness and then it transitions to brown sugar sweetness, hides the ABV very well 
Feel: Thick, low carbonation
Overall: Extremely good and well-balanced!"
2270,champ103,Aecht Schlenkerla Weichsel,3.62,"A: Pours with a noticeable clarity, a dark ruby brown color. A beige head rises ta about a finger and recedes. A foamy cap sticks throughout, with some lace.
S: The aroma is a big ""rauchy"" smoke up font, as one would expect from the style and brewery. At first a really enjoy that, but there is an almost fruity ester like quality, that brings in cherries and apple skins.
T: A meaty smokiness and baked bread mingle up front. The smoke becomes a bit acrid. There is for sure, some cherry like fruits, and apple ester like quality lingering. Which clashes a bit for me.
M/O: A lighter body than first expected, then I looked at the ABV and it fits. Crisp carbonation, but this could be just a tad cleaner for me. I will be able to finish the bottle with ease, though more out of curiosity than wanting to have another bottle.

I will try anything from this brewery, as they are always very unique. The smoke is there of course, but clashes with the fruity components I'm getting. Unique, well worth a try, and well made for what it is. Though, I prefer some of their other Rauchbier offerings, which isn't to say there is anything wrong with this."

Best before: Jun-2024
Consumed: Feb-2-2024

Crystal clear, gorgeous ruby red, lovely beige head. Little lacing. This thing is just pure cherry wood. Only the good, none of the bad or harsh. Sweet, woody, earthy, round, aromatic. A lingering spring dew sweetness that is just lovely. On the retronasal and well after the finish there is a lingering sweetish shine that reminds me of the mineraley sweet smell on the air when maple syrup is being boiled. 
The ""malty"" part of the malt comes through less than in the other Schlenkerlas I've tried, but the smoke aspect carries more of the beer in this one. I'm kind of surprised at how much I'm liking these smoked beers! It really is true what they say about having to ease into them to get accustomed before they really start tasting good to you.
Glad to have tried a rotbier finally. Seems like a nice style.

Smoked malt also assaults the palate - smoked ham, burnt caramel sweetness, with underlying woody and berry flavours - sweet and smoky with some herbal hop bitterness.

M: Medium bodied with moderate amounts of carbonation. Slightly watery at first with a smooth finish. 

O: Easy to drink with well hidden alcohol assuming that you enjoy a rauchbier with a pleasant mouthfeel. Enjoyable with a lot of complexity to the smoked malt flavors + aromas (this really hit home after I smoked 2 sides of salmon, a turkey, and a dick today over pecan and cherrywood)."

The beer pours a reddish amber color with good head retention and considerable sticky lacing. This beer looks great. On the nose, there's considerable cooked meat, smoke and light malt. On the palate, this beer is very malt forward, but with a dry roasty quality, and considerable smoked malt in the finish. Considering the relatively low abv., this beer delivers a lot of flavor. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a long, lightly roasty finish. Drinkability is outstanding in this beer, assuming you like rauchbier.

Appearance: Deep gold color with 3-finger white head. It is deep with a very hazy complexion, like many New England IPAs. Head is very thick, and it lasts a few minutes, leaving a small covering. There is a medium amount of lacing on the glass.

Smell: Strong aroma of citrus and pine, as well as some hops, pineapple, and other fruits. The citrus and pine aromas dominates the other aromas.

Taste: Bitter taste from the hops with a moderate sweetness like citrus. The sweetness and bitter edge are well-balanced. Has a very nice after-taste that lasts a moderate amount of time. Overall a nice balance and very drinkable.

Mouthfeel: Thick body, similar to orange juice with pulp. Medium alcohol, which matches the 8% listed on the can.

This is a very good New England IPA. It has a nice mix of citrus, hops, and other flavors, which makes it enjoyable. Another good IPA from Tree House, but I do prefer the Julius variations (Julius, Juliusss, King Julius, Emperor Julius). I like the overall balance, and would buy this again."
2287,papposilenus,Andromeda,3.69,"From a 16oz can, dated 09/11/23. Served in a spiegelau IPA glass.

Pours an utterly opaque milky mango flesh colour with two fingers of dense and super-soft lathery foam. Retention is excellent, leaving a fat, creamy cap and a solid blanket of foamy lacing,

Nose is sharp, tart and fruity. Aroma of bitter, pithy tropical fruit peels, like mango, guava, kiwi.

Taste is densely juicy and dank. Fruit purée of mango, peach and pine. Big fusel finish of diesel and vanilla extract.

Feel is heavy - mega-juicy and thick bodied with fine, tingly carbonation. Feels bigger than 8% abv.

Overall, not awful but disappointing for sure. This is the second TH NEDIPA I’ve had lately with what, to my palate, comes off as a ‘greasy diesel’ taste - bearable on small sips but a big gulp engulfed my sinuses with petroleum character. Hoping this isn’t going to be an ongoing thing."
2288,tigg924,Andromeda,3.59,"Had on tap at Sandwich. Pours ultra hazy, gold in color with one quarter inch head. Taste is peach, melon, and pine. Medium heavy body, moderate carbonation, bitter. Nor bad but not a regular purchase. A bit thick and a tad too bitter."
2289,The_Beer_Guru,Fayston Maple Imperial Stout with Coffee - Aged in Whiskey Barrels,4.49,"Very delicious! Perfect amount of sweetness, not overly sweet either. Strong maple syrup flavor with a medium body. Overall well done and would buy again."
2290,snaotheus,Fayston Maple Imperial Stout with Coffee - Aged in Whiskey Barrels,4.33,"2024-01-21
500ml bottle served in a snulip. If there's a date, I don't see it. @Braunmeister_1943 sent it to me.

Pours black, thick, small head that emerges slowly, tiny carbonation bubbles creeping up the side of the glass. Smell is Vietnamese coffee, dark chocolate bitterness, sweetness that I recognize as maple because it says maple on the label.

Taste is way more bitter than I was expecting. Tons of coffee bitterness, burnt cocoa notes and char, a little vanilla, and maple really just sneaking around the borders. Sweetness is there, kind of slipping in the backdoor. Booze is noticeable, but not dominant.

Mouthfeel is thick, alcohol heat is more noticeable in the feeling than in the flavor. Not still -- just a bit of life in the texture. Silky. This is very good."
2291,GreesyFizeek,Fayston Maple Imperial Stout with Coffee - Aged in Whiskey Barrels,4.22,"This one pours a fairly dark black color, with a small head, and a little bit of lacing.

This smells like vanilla, caramel, nutty coffee, milk chocolate, earthy maple, and roasted malt.

I still really enjoy all these beers, and I certainly enjoy how much easier they are to track down now. There’s a subtle but tasty barrel character, folding some caramel and spice into the coffee and maple notes. The maple is earthy, and not really too sweet, more just adding a silky velvety note to the stout. There’s chocolate and roast as well.

This is medium bodied, not boozy at all, with a great drinkability.

The interplay of everything going on here was done really well – there’s a lot here – coffee, maple, stout, barrel, and it’s all well represented and deftly balanced."
2292,SABERG,Fayston Maple Imperial Stout with Coffee - Aged in Whiskey Barrels,4.21,"Poured from the 500 ml bottle into the test glass.
A - Dark chocolate color, gently carbonated, consistant mocha ring resides through the experience.
S - Coffee forward, with a bit of nutmeg, cinammon all related to the coffee, not adjuncts. Black pepper, dark chocolate.
T - Espresso, a bit of vanilla, roast malt, as the offering warms a bit of the whiskey thread comes through. That element has less nuance, just a nice whiskey snap you can dig out of the coffee.
M - Medium in body, texture is dry from start to finish, again think espresso palate experience. Again delightfully dry finish, with a solid coffee burp! Smooths out with a small temp increase
O - A very good stout, certainly coffee forward. With some time and rise in temperature the offering rounds out a bit."
2293,Roguer,Fayston Maple Imperial Stout with Coffee - Aged in Whiskey Barrels,3.97,"Wow, the coffee really comes through on the nose - stronger even than the maple syrup and whiskey. It's frankly a little too strong, although obviously that's what they were going for. It does still smell fantastic, I just wasn't anticipating so much coffee.

The coffee really comes through on the palate just as strong. The maple syrup is still present, but the whiskey is mostly lost in the shuffle. Similarly, any dark rich notes from the stout base are a bit lost; this beer is mostly about the coffee, secondly about the maple syrup, and anything else in a distant third.

A bit slick on the palate. It's neither thick nor super lively, although there is plenty of back-end bite.

This is a solid beer, and if you're looking for a coffee-forward take on Fayston, this certainly delivers. For me, I'd prefer much more balance across the board: more from the stout base, more from the whiskey, and just a touch more from the maple syrup."
2294,JDUBWA412,Fayston Maple Imperial Stout with Coffee - Aged in Whiskey Barrels,5,absolutely unreal
2295,tobelerone,Fayston Maple Imperial Stout with Coffee - Aged in Whiskey Barrels,4.41,"Upon opening and when on the colder side it’s extremely coffee forward - the aroma fairly bursts from the bottle and coffee dominates on the palate. As the beer opens up and comes to temp whiskey notes become more prominent. There’s an undercurrent of maple that also emerges over time. Carbonation smoothes out and the middleweight body relaxes and fills out well, too. A roasty bitterness emerges in the finish. 

This is one of the starker examples of a beer changing over time and temperature fluctuation in recent memory - highly instructive, in fact. Whatever the case, it’s very good, and very much as advertised. This is an intensely coffee forward stout, and it would be interesting to see how this drinks in 3, 6, 12 months or more. Drink now if you want the full coffee experience."
2296,papposilenus,Fayston Maple Imperial Stout with Coffee - Aged in Whiskey Barrels,4.63,"From a 500ml bottle, undated as best I can tell. Served in a spiegelau BA tulip glass.

Pours cola-black with acorn-brown highlights and a scant quarter-finger of loose foam. Retention is nonexistent, leaving a meager skiff of fizz and a narrow collar which can be grudgingly roused up into a tattered sheet of lacing.

Nose is rich, warm, earthy, boozy. Aromas of earth, smoky booze and maple.

Taste is in accord with the nose, if thinner and less intense than expected. There’s a cereal, porridge-and-pudding smoothness. Tasting maple and smoke, maple-sweetened cup o’ joe, chocolate-caramel sweetness. Not a lot of barrel character apparent, a little wood smoke and whiskey at the finish.

Feel is powdery smooth but relatively thin bodied with fine, bright carbonation. There’s a mild, boozy, comfortable warmth in the gullet.

Overall, pleasant, an enjoyable sipper in front of the wood stove. Actually, edit to add: I’ve been sitting here with it for another half hour now and have decided it’s pretty well flawless."
2297,bobv,Fayston Maple Imperial Stout with Coffee - Aged in Whiskey Barrels,4.7,"This is the most recent 1 Pint .9 FL. OZ. bottle release from the Fayston Series. 

Moderate pour yields a one inch tan head over a pitch black body with lacing.

Nose of coffee, maple, caramel, vanilla, fudge, and whiskey.
Wow!

Taste is as good as the nose with loads of coffee and maple, with caramel and chocolate in a supporting role. Whiskey flavors become more apparent upon warming. Finish is mostly maple and whiskey barrel. 

Very nice, near velvet, mouthfeel with medium carbonation.

Overall, being a coffee lover, this is a superb offering from Sean L. and probably my favorite in the Fayston series. Please do yourself a favor and make the trek to wherever this is available and purchase a few!!

Cheers!!!"
2298,hman43,Cage's Castles,4.18,"Look: It pours cloudy orange with an off white head. Head retention is excellent. 

Smell: It has strong aromas featuring resinous flavors with orange and pineapple. There are some light honeydew notes. 

Taste: It has strong orange and resinous flavors with some melon. There are also pineapple and lime notes. 

Feel: It has a medium full body that is not quite as thick as other beers in the same category. 

Overall, quite tasty overall with plenty of fruity punch."

The body is a solid medium, nicely carbonated, moderate bitterness, very drinkable. 
Altogether, this is an outstranding take on New England style IPA, very juicy, very tasty, well hidden but appreciated ABV, deceptively drinkable, this is a treat anytime, I want another already."

I would definitely order again.

2305,jkblr,Hop Honcho,4.25,"12oz can from April purchased today at room temperature poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass at fridge temp 9% ABV 90 IBU. Living dangerously. The beer pours hazy amber in color with light khaki head. The head recedes to a thin cap and leaves rings of lacing. The aroma is mild with caramel malt and faded pine & grapefruit. The taste is bittersweet caramel malt with more fading hops and firm bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with average carbonation and a semi dry finish. Overall, good, but past it's prime. Numerical rating bumped to the average to compensate for conditions."
2306,Oktoberfest,Hop Honcho,4.25,"Big and flavorful. Full of juicy grapefruit and pine with a traditional hop bitterness at the end.

Interestingly, ""honcho"" isn't a Spanish word. It's actually Japanese for ""Squad Leader."" American POWs brought the term back from the war and it soon joined the vernacular.

Dōmo arigatō, Mr. Hop Honcho."
2307,zeff80,Hop Honcho,4.21,"12oz can. Poured out a clear, golden orange color with a small, off-white head of foam. It left sudsy trails of lacing. It smelled of orange, grapefruit, pineapple, bready notes and pine. Sweet citrusy taste with toffee and a sharp, resinous bitterness."
2308,BEERchitect,Hop Honcho,4.25,"If you wouldn't know better yourself, one sip of Fat Head's Imperial IPA would suggest that you were drinking on the West Coast. Doing that style better than the vast majority of even West Coast brewers, Fat Heads leads the pack with their ""Chief of the Leaf"" beer.

Pale golden straw and only displaying a faint haze, the frothy Hop Honcho revs up with a bold hop perfume of pine, citrus, tropical fruit and peppery herb for a curiously dank but fruity perfume. But the taste leads first with a soft foundation of caramel, honey and seemingly granola in a malty introduction.

But anything sweet is short lived as the hops rush in with a burst of tangerine, pink grapefruit and lime with a slightly more tropical nod toward pineapple and apricot. Diving quickly into a drying late taste, the fruit flavors depict fruit peels, rinds and pith in a clean bitterness woven together with peppery pine, fresh grass clippings and dry hemp.

Medium bodied and trending dry and dangerously drinkable, its easy to look past the beer's elevated alcohol content and drink in refreshing, quaffable manner. A long and bitter aftertaste is a welcomed reset of IPA back to something gullet gripping, strikingly bitter, but still crisp sensibility."
2309,cjeep,Hop Honcho,4.25,"Yes, yes yes yes yes. It is a big yes from me. Great outfit. Great beer aroma is piney happy taste delivers on the nose. Mouth feel is rich and smooth. It is a winner from fat head."

2316,BEERchitect,Sundae Thunderstorm,4.25,"If sundaes were always fifteen percent in alcohol content then none of us would have every outgrown them. 3 Floyds takes such opportunities with a barrel-aged version of their Dark Lord Imperial Stout and adds vanilla, cocoa and coffee for that extra little nudge toward mocha that we all enjoy.

Jet black and pouring like tar, Sundae Thunderstorm showers the senses with a host of candy shop scent in chocolate, vanilla, coffee and liqueur spice with huge impressions of cakey malts. And as the dark ale swirls in the glass, its sticky legging precedes an initial taste of chocolate, brownie batter, french vanilla, fudge and blackstrap molasses.

Although the roast of espresso is present, the enormity of malt sweetness and sugar additions easily overshadow the roast while leaving only a smoky chocolate, walnut and burnt cream flavor in its wake. Wrapped in the soothing taste of vanilla, a sense of marshmallow comes into play before a late charge into the caramel, nutty, toasty and spicy flavors of bourbon help as much as any hops in a long, lush and sweet finish.

Full bodied, pastry-rich and pleasantly cloying on the tongue, this variation of Dark Lord is a welcomed session meant for a few ounces of consumption at a time."
2317,neenerzig,Sundae Thunderstorm,4.53,"This beer is a bourbon barrel aged version of Dark Lord with coffee and cocoa needs added as well. Having this beer on tap at the Winking Lizard, as Winking Lizard was lucky enough to get kegs of different variants of Dark Lord this week for Winking Lizard’s 40th anniversary celebration. Served in a tulip glass, this beer draws a very dark brown color with some small, deep ruby highlights around the edges when held up to the light. Has a brown head that was about half an inch thick one first drawn and served that settles very quickly to a thin ring lining the inside of the glass. Practically no lacing at all here to speak of. Aromas of cocoa nibs, bourbon oak, roasted caramel malts and molasses. The flavor profile was very similar, with cocoa nibs, roasted coffee caramel malt sweetness, bourbon and oak notes, and molasses. Very sweet and decadent. A truly excellent beer all around!

Eric"
2318,JohnnyHopps,Sundae Thunderstorm,4.75,"Appearance - The beer poured in oily black color with dark bubbles crowning the glass.

Smell - The nose had the presence of chocolate and vanilla sweetness. Even from the smell, it did seem like a sundae. 

Taste - The profile was Dark Lord meets melted chocolate sundae. Notes of chocolate, vanilla, coffee, and molasses were present. There was not any bitterness. I felt like I detected notes of lactose sugar as well. The finish was sweet, but not overly sweet or cloying. 

Mouthfeel - The sticky profile lingered nicely on the tongue. 

Overall - Of the new 2023 variants, this was my favorite."
2319,Sabtos,Sundae Thunderstorm,4.56,"Matte black with a densely fluffy tan head that retains well.

A coffee-vanilla showcase of absurd proportions, this was my favorite variant pour this year. It not only competes with my memory of tasting French Vanilla Militia for the first time (on draft at DLD 2017), but it even surpasses it with gusto.

This is absolutely scrumptious and I can't wait to dig into both of my bottles in due time.

---

Revisiting again from the bottle on New Year's Eve, it's more of a coffee-dominant bomb than my blasted palate recognized during DLD. I'm reducing my 4.8 rating on a slightly more sober palate.

The vanilla is perhaps less integrated, hot and floral than I recall, while the coffee has a toasted, flaky element to it, with some toffee or even burnt brown sugar. The bourbon barrel gives a very spicy, warming whiskey punch, not complementing the vanilla even as well as their own shelfie Trollsx3. It even--and this is crazy--seems slightly less delicious than Crushing Mass.

Still, to be clear, it is delicious."
2320,Rug,God Of The Forest,4.28,"On tap at Tree House Charlton

The day before Thanksgiving Tree House haul is an annual tradition for me at this point. I figured I might as well grab a few pours while I’m here too. Nate recently recommended this beer on a YouTube video, so I figured it would be a good place to start for this visit. Let’s dig in

Pours a hazy yellow gold with 2 fingers of creamy off white head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing

The nose is sweeter than I was expecting for a New Zealand hopped beer but I dig it. I’m picking up on aromas of jammy peach, orange juice, bready malt, white grape, grassy hops, apricot, light vanilla, and mango skin

It’s also quite sweet in taste, but again I still like it. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting pineapple juice, mango skin, doughy malt, grassy hops, lime zest, jammy peach, vanilla, and light apricot. The swallow brings notes of jammy peach, white grape, lime zest, grassy hops, bready malt, orange juice, and light honey

A medium body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a silky beer. Finishes mostly dry with a lingering but light bitterness

Pours an opaque, milky-pale orange with a finger of super-creamy suds. Retention is excellent, leaving a thick, creamy cap and a solid curtain of sudsy lacing.

Powerful nose of pithy tropical fruit. Aromas of oily citrus, pineapple-orange and sandalwood.

Taste is in line with the aroma, with more bitterness than anticipated. Tasting oily orange peel, grapefruit, woody pineapple and an unusual rank? flavor, a sort of woody herb and banana peel kind of bitterness - strange but not unpleasant.

Feel is creamy, oily, medium bodied but maybe feeling a bit lighter owing to the bright, zesty carbonation… I hate it when I can’t stop myself from finishing the beer before I finish doing mouthfeel but that’s what just happened here. Whoops. It was really good. There’s a sticky hopulin grittiness, like licking the inside of an underripe banana skin - either you’ve done that or you haven’t.

Overall, outstanding. Best TH NEDIPA of the year? I think so."

I get a lot of banana character like that You Most Cherished Memories way of banana, but it's also got this herbaceous lime, mint, spicy herb, possibly sage character.

S & T: Sweet. Bourbon barrel vanilla and even some toasted coconut. Chocolate. Brown Sugar. Brandy. Bready malt. Notes of citrus. Oak, leather, pipe tobacco.

MF: Smooth. Full bodied. Hidden alcohol. Viscous.

O: Really nice execution. The first two blends are not stouts, and thats ok here. I like FW stouts and their barrel character, but their strong ales are just as good in their own way. The citrus/minor buried hop components are a nice note within this symphony."

2334,Beginner2,35th Anniversary Cuvée,4.52,"A masterful blending that continually changes on me with each sip. The barrel variety imparts so many nuances that it is too much work for me to analyze and describe. But I'll try to give just rewards to this celebration of 35 years of crafting and innovation.

This Cuvee' opens appetizingly, mostly with its diverse Smells from the barrels. They are in the attack and stay until the last sip. Tastes are balanced throughout, despite my expecting it to become too sweet. Cuvee' is heavy in my mouth. Not boozy despite 14.7 ABV. How do they do that ?

Since I tend now to drink mostly table ales, I don't want to generalize too much about the masters of barrel-aging. But FBarber raises an interesting comparison to Firestone Walker. Both are American pioneers in barrel-aging for over three decades; both have parents that capitalize this expensive process; and the parents seem to let their ""kids"" innovate... particularly since enough consumers are willing to pay a premium price. But in the final analysis.... If ever I hear the comment that AB has changed GI for the worse, I will think of this Cuvee. Cheers !

The flavors are mostly similar: bourbon, vanilla, some cognac, malt, chocolate, caramel, plum, oak, tobacco, light rum. Tastes spicy. Smooth, a very good fuller body, appropriately carbonated. 

Pretty delicious. Leans more towards a Barleywine for me, but both styles are there. Has an array of solid aromas and flavors. The bourbon barrels have a strong presence, the others show at different levels. Really well done."
2337,snaotheus,35th Anniversary Cuvée,4,"2023-07-30
12oz bottle served in a snulip. Drink By 30APR28. Got it from @FBarber in a Holiday Inn lobby.

Pours black, thick, almost no head. Smell is chocolate, booze, vanilla, char.

Taste follows the aroma pretty closely, coffee bitterness gets added into the mix. Something like maple syrup but with barky bitterness.

Mouthfeel is fairly heavy, though not as heavy as I would expect. Very smooth, a little sticky. Overall, very nice."
2338,GrumpyGas,35th Anniversary Cuvée,4.47,"12oz bottle dated 30APR23 and poured into a snifter almost boasts a 1/4"" cap of tan colored bubbles that dissipates to random wisps of bubbles. Even agitation only causes a film to coat the glass before running back. Dark, dark brown, opaque body that looks clear at the edges.

Aroma includes the wood notes of ash and wet oak, the barrel notes of molasses, vanillin, booze, rum, and bourbon, along with cocoa, stone fruits, toffee, and spices. That seems impressive enough, yet they are all in the flavor as well.

Mouthfeel is just short of tongue coating, full, and nearly sticks around with a very pleasant aftertaste.

Overall a fine slow sipper that has everything you could want in the style. Bring your own book and cigar."
2339,REVZEB,35th Anniversary Cuvée,4.27,"Very dark brown pour with a cap that is closer to tan than beige. Nose in order: big molasses and bourbon, toffee, vanillin oak, oxidized barley, caramel malt, date, and licorice, very GI composition. Taste is simpler: mix of bourbon barrel, molasses and toffee with an accentuate gooey dark fruit note. Feel is so smooth and decently warm, slight oxidation and sticky, sneaky lightens up after dwelling in the warm depths of the barrel."
2340,FBarber,35th Anniversary Cuvée,4.55,"Pours a dark brown/black color. Completely opaque. Like BCBS, it is only lightly viscous in appearance. An agressive pour provides a one or two finger head that quickly dissipates leaving no residual head. Aroma is dominated by oak with the heavy barrel presence coming through strongly up front. Notes of bourbon, rum, cognac, oak, west musty wood all are there. Along with that come notes of sweet rich malt, dark chocolate, marshmallow, some subtle dark fruit, spice, and rum soaked fruit cake. 

The taste on this is so complex - its one of those beers that every time you take a sip, you get a different impression of what the beer is. What I will say is that the predominant character of the beer is barrel - rum, cognac, bourbon - all of them come through in their own ways at different times. Underneath that there are notes of chocolate, dark fruit, fruit cake, some spicy rye, chocolate covered cherry, and strong tannic notes. Feel is medium to full bodied, sticky and yet very dry on the finish. Bright carbonation for a beer like this. Very dry on the finish. 

Overall this is a lovely beer and a fantastic blend. It reminds me quite a bit of the Firestone Walker Anniversary beers. Well worth seeking out for any beer aficionado, for those that love barrel aged beers that showcase the barrels, this will be nothing less than a homerun."

2343,edthehead,Elaborative #6,4.6,"Black with limited tan head and no real lacing to speak of. The bourbon and cognac while both present seem to feature more of the cognac than bourbon, with subtle notes of roasty coffee, chocolate, and date on the finish. Medium body and carbonation."
2344,GreesyFizeek,Elaborative #6,4.23,"This one pours a fairly dark black color, with a small head, and not much lacing.

This smells like fruity cognac, milk chocolate, oak, caramelly bourbon, a touch of licorice and roasted malt, and vanilla.

This feels more successful than Elaborative Seven was. It’s still a bit sweeter than expected, but the lack of vanilla allows for interesting barrel nuances to come through. There’s some nice fruitiness and spice from cognac, and some nice vanilla and toasted oak. There’s lots of milk chocolate, a touch of licorice, some roast, and coffee-like flavors.

This is medium bodied, very creamy, and pretty rich, with sweetness lingering.

I don’t think either of these stand up to the best in this series – that would be Elaborative Three or Five. But they were still quite enjoyable."
2345,Holderness,Elaborative #6,4.17,"Tried blind alongside Elaborative 7. The two are surprisingly similar and my partner guessed that this one was Elaboartive 7. Both are the sweetest stouts I've had to date from HF. The nose is spirits-forward (more bourbon than cognac) with rich milk chocolate, espresso, and dried dark fruit. Flavors are sweet and chocolatey. Mouthfeel is quite thin for the style, with moderate carbonation. Overall quite delicious albeit a bit pricey

Creamy lacing lingers behind, for moments after the tipping. Nose is strong & malty, palate is very balanced in bitter, sweet, creamy, woody, even a little boozy. Thick swallow, it lingers.

2355,SpaceCamp,Double Barrel-Aged Imperial Reserve Stout,4.18,"L: Poured a thick chocolate, forming a medium peanut head that was quick to dissipate, leaving behind a thin layer of effervescent retention and zero lacing around the edge of the glass. Held to the light, this beer has an opaque, chunky chocolate hue.

S: Heavy notes of chocolate, oak (bourbon barrel), followed by faint hints of vanilla and lactose. Light char notes.

T: Starts off with big mounds of chocolate and plenty of bourbon barrel influence, followed by some toffee, char, and oak. Finishes with a nice lactose sweetness.

B: Thick, silky, creamy mouthfeel which coats the mouth. Some light carbonation on the tongue. Smooth and drinkable. Medium- to full-bodied.

O: The bourbon barrel really adds some kick which would otherwise be lacking. Look was standard for stouts, with some underwhelming aromas. The taste was stronger - hefty chocolate punch and plenty of oak/bourbon influence that complement each other well. The mouthfeel was excellent - coating, silky, and smooth. A very good entry."

Poured into a goblet. Pours a wickedly dark, black color. Absolutely opaque with not a hint of light showing through. A very thin but dense, mocha colored head on the initial pour. Sticky lacing left on the glass during the sampling.

Aromas of chocolate, toffee, and a slightly boozy smell.

Wow, what a delicious stout. Flavors of sweet chocolate, vanilla, with deep roasted malts. As the beer warms I get notes of raisins/prunes. The oakiness of the bourbon barrels and a distinct bourbon flavor really shine through. The ABV is lurking there for sure. A nice sipping brew.

A smooth, thicker consistency that leaves a bourbon flavored coating on the inside of the mouth after each sip. Low carbonation.

Overall, a top-notch, higher ABV Imperial Stout. One of the best stouts I’ve had recently. If the limited availability is correct based on the breweries notes, I’m really glad I had an opportunity to sample this. An A+ beer in my opinion…cheers!"

S - Chocolate, chocolate char, roasted fudge, lighgt cream, and light Bourbon.

T - Bourbon barrel and oak present throughout until the very end where this has a nice lingering toasted fudge and chocolate linger for a good long time after the sip.

M - Thick/light syrupy and silky with some warming on the way down, the ABV is not shy.

O - The Bourbon / oak aspect is a little on the harsh side but I'm guessing with some age, it should become more rounded around the edges. Overall, no complaints."

2365,GreesyFizeek,Benthic - Immortal Vintage Blend,4.44,"This one pours a very dark black color, with a small head, and a little bit of lacing.

This smells very coconut forward, but quite roasty, as the coffee used seems to be quite bitter.

This has a super soft and pastry heavy coconut vibe to it, but there’s a ton of char and roast here as well. It would not probably appeal to the most sticky and glutinous pastrybois, but it works well for me. There’s smoke, licorice, oak, roast, char, and vanilla here, with a wonderfully soft and toasty coconut sweetness keeping it all pretty well balanced.

This is thick, but not syrupy and sludgy, with very little booziness to it.

This was highly complex and overall quite delicious."

2371,BEERchitect,"Term Oil Vanilla, Pistachio & Granola",4.44,"When hitting the road, there's a need that's bigger than just oil. We're going to need snacks as well. Toppling Goliath might be looking to get out of Iowa and they're going to need a beer worthy trail mix to go with them. Chocked full of pistachio, oats, honey, vanilla and a thirst for stout, this is a road trip for the palate like no other.

Jet black and pouring like tar, the Vanilla Pistachio & Granola version of Term Oil releases a deep and dark tarnish mocha froth that dissolves soon after the pour to render its appearance as still and quiet with espresso likeness. As its decadent scent of chocolate, coffee, cream and nuttiness rise toward the nose, full impressions of granola paired with coffee and kahlua take a stronghold on the early palate. Savory and sweet on the tongue, its rich and viscous sweetness starts with blackstrap molasses as it invites complementary malt flavors of toffee, heavy cream, vanilla, brown sugar and honey to further seduce the tastebuds.

As the beer's more roasty edges give the sweet malts a more robust tone, there's a sweeter espresso taste that comes with dark, bittersweet chocolate, burnt cream and roasted nuttiness to remind the middle palate that there's still a stout supporting all those granola flavors. A moderately bitter balance steps in late to take an edge off of the residual sweetness and to give the roasted flavors more of a dark coffee impression.

Lavishly full, pleasantly cloying and celebrating the mouthfeel of cake batter, the heavy beer is a slow sipping affair, relegated to after dinner digestives. Don't look at it to pair with dessert but rather to replace dessert altogether. Finishing decidedly sweet granola flavors extend with an infinite malty sweet taste with those trail mix nuances, and kahlua and bourbon warmth in tow."

Black colored body. No real head upon pouring. Continuing is a very thin ring. Oily sheen left behind.
Aroma has a lot of bourbon barrel that infuses with the sweet vanilla and sugary graham cracker. The nutty pistachio mixes in as sort of balance on the sweetness.
Taste is full, with sweet vanilla and the vanilla from the oak bourbon barrel. The granola is also sweet but introduces some earthy and nutty flavor. The pistachio arrives late with its earthy nut essence. The aftertaste fades away from the sweet emphasis and ends with a earthy, nutty, and chocolate tone.
Mouth feel is thick and sticky. Higher ABV% is warming but well hidden as to mouth and tongue burn. Supportive carbonation.
Taste profile is long lasting and progresses from sweet alcohol to earthy nuts and grains. The flavors at the end are so enticing as to hurry up the sipping process. The ending flavors are confectionery like but acknowledges the high ABV%."

Opaque pour, black and inky with a large cap of dark mocha-colored head that quickly fizzles away. Pretty strong spice characteristics immediately on the nose, with roast and spirit barrel apparent as well. Notes of cinnamon, coffee, brewer licorice, marshmallow and minor impressions of vanilla through the bourbon barrel, faint tobacco...rich dark chocolate, smooth full-bodied mouthfeel with some present viscosity.

The Rusty Nail is apparent here, but I feel like the porter that Fremont blended it with may be a adding a nice bittersweet chocolate and roasted characteristic that balances nicely with the 'bigness' and spices of the RN. Good stuff, as always."

Pours a very dark mahogany brown, appearing opaque in the glass with a fine, half finger dark khaki head with great retention and nice lacing. Aroma of dark toasted malt, bourbon, cinnamon, cocoa and licorice. Flavor is dark toasted malt, cinnamon, bourbon, black licorice and bakers chocolate with light oak. Medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess. The Rusty Nail roots of this blend is quite clear and it inherits that cinnamon and licorice spicing, and has nice oaky bourbon character too. A somewhat dry, but spicy, chocolatey and roasted finish. Perhaps a bit lighter in body than Rusty nail and a little less flavor depth, but nicely balanced and a joy to drink. Nicely done and a deal compared to a bomber of Rusty Nail."
2378,StonedTrippin,Melange Barrel-Aged Cuvee,4.25,"super cool project, i wonder what spawned it, multiple vintages of rusty nail blended with a porter, a tasty beer for sure, but perhaps rusty nail isnt selling like it used to and they had to repurpose some juice to make it move. either way i was delighted to find it on tap locally, still bold and dark and big, just a little less of a commitment than a proper rusty nail is. near black, matte luster, high active caramel colored head from the tap, super airy, looks great on top of this base. the aroma is fire too, cinnamon is tame but persistent, cocoa in the grain profile is obvious, the porter aspects soften the intensity of the licorice spice too but its not invisible, and i get milk chocolate, vanilla, and smoke nuances, along with just some trace oxidation which is there in the flavor too, probably from the oldest beer in this blend. its very barrel forward in the flavor, wood over whiskey to me which works, and some char is there too adding a little bitterness for counterpoint against the warmer sweeter cinnamon and malty layers. i like that the best parts of rusty nail are still here, but that they are softer and the whole thing is more drinkable and less sugary. its hard to call something at 10% abv drinkable, but compared to the mother beer it certainly is! nutty, a hint of clove spice too, wintery and with good bitterness from the dark barley. smooth to drink on, not a permanent palate decision, and overall something quite unique and special, especially keeping rusty nail in mind, this is a neat spin off from that, i will happy drink more of this over the holidays if i can find it..."
2379,cjgiant,Melange Barrel-Aged Cuvee,4.09,"Shared pour (should revisit):
Huge mocha head atop a black body, causing a temporary sheet of lacing. Nose is red wine berry-tinged bourbon barley wine with a dulling char influence. A swirl brings forth some more straightforward dark chocolate stout notes.

Taste surprised me a bit, with bitter dark chocolate to even bakers chocolate punching first. The berry sneaks in behind this, itself backed by a hint of whiskey barrel and some bourbon soaked raisin. A somewhat ashy dry finish closes this pour.

Interesting, at least. The nose did remind me of Rusty Nail slightly (I thought it was because I just bought a bottle, before reading the description). The beer did take a left turn before getting to the taste. It’s a nice, roasty bitter roasty stout with some accents, but it threw me around a little.

I think maybe we tackled this one a little too cold, as the bottom of the glass was better than the start. Probably need a second run at this one, some time."

2381,Rug,Melange Barrel-Aged Cuvee,4.34,"2023 vintage 

The Rusty Nail is by far my favorite Fremont beer, so obviously I couldn’t pass up on this one. I can’t imagine the Porter blended in here will be that prevalent between the aggressive notes of TRN and aging in a whiskey barrel, but I’m sure it’ll be great anyways. Let’s crack it open and find out

Pours completely pitch black with 2 fingers of frothy dark tan head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing

The nose is quite reminiscent of TRN, but with a fruitier vibe to it. I’m picking up on aromas of earthy cinnamon, fig, cocoa powder, walnut, brown sugar, dark bread, black licorice, and vanilla bean

There’s a bit less definition to it in taste, but I can’t really complain. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting milk chocolate, molasses, sweet whiskey, earthy cinnamon, caramel, brown sugar, black cherry, and light molasses. The swallow brings notes of earthy cinnamon, dry oak, milk chocolate, sweet bourbon, anise, burnt caramel, vanilla bean, and molasses

A medium full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a smooth beer. Finishes mostly dry with a nice spice to it

While it doesn’t come close to the source material, I still think this is a great take on it"

The Triple didn't seem to be appreciably ""bigger"" or ""bolder"" than its cousin, the Double. The barrel notes are present in the nose and flavor profile, but they are certainly not assertive. The body is definitely hearty and the heft holds up well to the whiskey notes.

For any other brewery, this offering is more than solid. For TH, it's a bit of a disappointment."
2386,beerbully,Triple Shot - Sunshower,4.53,"L- Pours a thick, dark, syrupy black with a mocha head of about a half inch......not much retention on the head...lacing is thick but quickly runs down the side of the glass

S- Sweet Chocolate fudge and roasty coffee.....vanilla, caramel, brown sugar, molasses.....

T- Dark chocolate, coffee, fudge, anise, molasses.....some roasty char..,has some boozy heat

F- Thick and creamy....low carb.....full bodied.....

O- Excellent brew with some intense chocolate and coffee flavors..... definitely a sipper and one per sitting"
2387,agreenman19,Triple Shot - Sunshower,4.79,"L - I like the can. It's a sticker, but feels legit. Artwork is moody and rad. Pours the darkest brown with a glowing mocha tan head. Leaves a small film of lacing behind with craters forming on the surface.

S - milk chocolate and fudge. Vanilla extract, visceral bold roast coffee beans drizzled with chocolate syrup. 

T - roasty and acrid. Clumpy ground coffee grinds with similar potency. Dark chocolate and cacao beans. Subtle marshmallowiness a result of the likely high ABV. Lip-coating syrup prolongs the deep, earthy barrel undertones. Bourbon and chocolate mix oh so well. Finish is herbal, then sweet, and finally bitter.

F - thick and full-bodied with a strong, sugary sweetness to remind you that this ain't your grandfather's coffee stout.

O - this one's good. Rich and decadent with the perfect balance of booze, chocolate, and coffee."

T-Lychee, orange, pineapple, peach, mango, greatfruit finish

F- Less than medium, low carb, 

O- Solid brew....but not among the best best from OH"
2390,thebeers,Nectar Diamonds,3.89,"Cloudy pale orange, close to yellow, with two fat fingers of antique white head. Good retention and scuzzy lacing.

Light citrus, indistinct tropical fruits, white pepper and distant Playdoh in the aroma. Some nice dankness joins the mix as it warms and the head dissipates.

Much more intensely fruity flavors in the taste — nectarines, peach, candied orange, passionfruit. Quite sweet up front. Balanced against slightly by some of that pepper and, again, distant Playdoh. 

Medium-to-heavy bodied with a fairly slick feel. Prickly carbonation.

The sweet tropical flavors here are pretty tasty. Not necessarily balanced or distinct enough for me to revisit."
2391,hopsputin,Nectar Diamonds,4.25,"a: super murky creamy orange color with a hint of gold. pours a 1.5 finger rocky off-white head

s: some earthy dank herbal notes for sure upfront followed by tangerines, nectarines, orange juice, peach juice. papaya, mango sorbet and some sweet candi sugar

t: sweet pineapple and mango followed by some dank herbal notes. tangerines and guava, followed by peach cobbler and orange juice. touch of honeydew and faint crackers

m: chewy, medium mouthfeel with low-medium carbonation

o: tasty NEDIPA here. not too sweet, and the herbal notes add a bit of uniqueness to this that gives some interesting harmonization. i'm a fan"
2392,Hayesbro,Nectar Diamonds,4.39,"Pours a regular NEIPA straw with a small head. Aroma mostly of hops. Intense flavors of tropical fruit, not quite pineappley as people say of Nectaron but in that neighborhood. Fairly sweet, not much bitterness to balance it out. Little bit of hop bite, though. Medium mouthfeel."
2393,Luscious_Malfoy,Bourbon Barrel Okie Weekend,4.48,poured from a 12oz bottle into a TG DBA tumbler. pours dark brown with a finger of mocha brown foam. rich coconut and vanilla on the nose. touch of chocolate and bourbon barrel. taste follows. the adjuncts kind of dominate. the barrel is half there at best but it’s tasty. rich and sweet but tasty. idk if i necessarily get the brown ale component. maybe a touch of nuttiness but more than anything less intense chocolate. medium-full mouthfeel. solid.
2394,JamarcusMarinovich,Bourbon Barrel Okie Weekend,3.88,"Poured from bottle to pint glass a dark brown almost black color with almost no head (which is fine with me). Sweet and bourbon boozy on the nose, perhaps a bit of dark toffee/caramel. Dinged a bit on taste as this is fully bourbon-forward with no hiding the high ABV. Hits warm on the tongue with some cocoa, roasted malt, perhaps currant and even rum notes. Lingers a bit, sweet but not in-your-face, this is a sipper for sure. All in all, this is a fine offering. Gotta dig the artwork from these guys, too."
2395,Brutaltruth,Bourbon Barrel Okie Weekend,4.31,"From the bottle in a snifter. This monster pours a rugged and murky blackish 
brown with a faint head of khaki foam that fizzles to a razor thin ring with 
decent legs. Nose of bourbon, toasted coconut, subtle vanilla, oak, dark
brown sugars, and dark cocoa, and toffee. Flavors show depth beyond 
the nose with rum, bourbon, oak, vanilla, toffee, coffee, subtle dark 
berry notes, cola, fudge, and subtle char. Mouth feel is full, smooth, 
rich coating, faint carbonation, moderately coating, very warm, and 
finishing lightly dry and sweet without being overly cloying.

Overall, a solid little brew.

Cheers"
2396,pathman,Bourbon Barrel Okie Weekend,4.5,12/25/23 bottle @ home
2397,robwired,Bourbon Barrel Okie Weekend,4.39,"Nose is of caramelized sugar.
Taste has top notes of marshmallow and coconut with a through-flavor of vanilla and undertones of cacao nibs.
Mouthfeel is on the sticky side.
Finish comes back to the caramelized sugar."
2398,Roguer,Bourbon Barrel Okie Weekend,3.89,"Lots of floaters in this one, and quite murky from the bottom of the glass. I certainly can't state that it's an attractive brew.

Mouthfeel suffers, as well, as the coconut chunks can be chewy and unpleasant, and the beer is both hot and fizzy. However, it's also thick and chewy. Calling it a 3 on balance for mouthfeel.

On the nose, it's very pleasant, but also carries an almost neutral heat. As it sits longer, more notes of chocolate emerge, as well as bourbon and caramel. Vanilla and coconut take more time to peek around the corner, but they're there.

After all of that, on the palate, this is nothing but delicious. Decadent, rich, sweet; dark and chocolatey. Some of the issues on the nose, such as the heavy heat, are present on the palate as well, but there's simply more going on to make it all worthwhile. Tons of chocolate; some marshmallow, vanilla, caramel, and toffee; minor cola. Bourbon is noticeable but not prominent.

Overall, this one is a conundrum. It's certainly a delicious beer, but it's by no means without its flaws - and those flaws do contribute to the overall experience."
2399,Sheppard,Gilded Grove - Bourbon Barrel,3.52,"Let's start with the presentation. This came in a waxed bottle. Let's be real here, waxed bottles are really really dumb and wholly unnecessary. The specialness is taken away when you're hacking away at the wax for a half an hour.

Anyhoo.

Pours a reddish brown. No head at all to speak of, not that I'd expect it. Get a nose of almond and pistachio. Get almost some aged cheddar as well. I get some caramel, toffee, some roasted almonds. Perhaps some banana bread and brown sugar as well. The body doesn't seem particularly sustained big, but there is some evolution in how the flavors present themselves. Between aroma and taste, there just seems something that doesn't click for me with either. It's fine, but there are other barleywines out there that are more impressive."
2400,Roguer,Gilded Grove - Bourbon Barrel,4.6,"Tasting notes of honey, white bread, wheat, light leather, bourbon, oak. Very pleasant heat that reminds you of the ABV. Definitely on the sweet side, but an absolutely delectable treat."
2401,tigg924,Gilded Grove - Bourbon Barrel,4.43,"Had on tap at Charlton. Pours clear, bronze in color with one quarter inch head. Taste is bourbon, English toffee, and vanilla. Heavy body, low carbonation, slightly sweet. Good barleywine but the least interesting of the 3 versions. Boozy and good."
2402,jzeilinger,Gilded Grove - Bourbon Barrel,4.45,"A - Light medium caramel bronze with little to no lacing.

S - Cherries, light sweet toasted caramel, and some Bourbon.

T - Booze is pronounced followed with toastred caramel (with some slight graininess), Bourbon, light cherry cordial, vanilla, sweet brown sugar, and a small trace of butterscotch on the back side.

M - Light syrupy body that's silky smooth and warming in the back of the throat. 

O - This is unique and fantastic."
2403,Knapp85,Gilded Grove - Bourbon Barrel,4.32,"Dark golden color with a thin white head that fades quickly. Lots of caramel and honey on the nose. The taste has more caramel, subtle cherry and more honey with vanilla. The feel is rich, nice full body and silky smooth. Overall a very nice Barleywine"
2404,lucius10,Gilded Grove - Bourbon Barrel,4.48,"Sweet caramel and vanilla, a hint of butterscotch, faint dark fruits, and a toffee-sweet, bourbon barrel nose on this one! Taste follows with some sweet toffee and caramel candy upfront...and then a vanilla-bourbon barrel finish. This is very well-balanced with a well-integrated bourbon barrel. Delicious!"
2405,TheOccasionalBeer,Old Rasputin XXV (Aged in Bourbon Barrels),4.27,"I had some of this over Christmas but wasn't in a position to review it, though I did have presence of mind to reserve a bottle since everyone really liked it at the time. Popping the cap once again, yeast, slightly caramelized molasses, and apple/pear brandy wafts out. Three fingers of light milk chocolate foam set up shop over opaque brown-tinged blackness. Still the same scents from the glass, maybe more brown sugar than molasses and less fruit in the brandy. Coffee and chocolate prevail in the mouth after the initial hit of brandy lingers only a little. Not rough, but not exactly smooth either. This is definitely a slow sipper, to be enjoyed as it opens in the glass."
2406,OldJoeHam,Old Rasputin XXV (Aged in Bourbon Barrels),4.42,"Pours an opa que, solid deep brown maybe a hint of red in the light. Tan head the dissipates rapidly. Light lacing. Smell is a bourbon leaning toward vanilla, but taste is more Carmel. The bourbon comes through nicely, very present, not dominant. Must have been a sweeter bourbon in that barrel. There is some bitterness on roof of my mouth but it's a nice mix. Love the flavor. The feel is a bit crisp, a bit carbonated, but this is the stellar beer I would expect from these guys."
2407,TerryMills,Old Rasputin XXV (Aged in Bourbon Barrels),4.21,"Old Rasputin is one of my go to stouts so I’m partial lol . Same solid base beer but this seems to have a little more bitterness on the end . This could use some age on it to blend all the flavors , maybe 3-4 years it would be world class ."

2409,augustgarage,Old Rasputin XXV (Aged in Bourbon Barrels),4.31,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into my snifter. 

Opaque bistre body with a thin almond cap. Fine, broken, soapy lacing; fast-running tears. Decent retention.

Sweet, potent aromatics suffused with brown sugar, cocoa nibs, bourbon, vanilla, and hints of coconut, tobacco, and loam. 

Malt balls and bourbon on the palate - mild, grassy, fleeting bitterness joins the baker's chocolate/burnt sugar/coffee notes. Finish is quite dry and sudden with hints of char. Barrel notes return in the aftertaste as you exhale. Burly yet lithe and well balanced.

Medium-full bodied, faintly oily with moderate carbonation. ABV fairly well concealed, contributing more flavor/body than heat.

Remains very drinkable with the barrel aging adding complexity without overwhelming the base beer. Excellent as usual."
2410,sjrider,Old Rasputin XXV (Aged in Bourbon Barrels),4.24,"Bottle pour - used motor oil with thick chocolate milk head leaving significant lacing. Nose is mild roasty malt with hints of sweet barrel wood. Taste follows with cocoa,vanilla and brown sugar. Feels a bit thin and taste leans towards sweet. Still tasty af."
2411,Tilley4,Old Rasputin XXV (Aged in Bourbon Barrels),4.09,"While definitely a bit lacking with the consistency, the beer still tastes great....bourbon barrel is there but doesn't overpower anything....

Not rich and creamy like i hoped but it tastes good enough to overlook s0ke flaws....

Can't say I would seek this out again but I'm glad I tried it.. 

Just a bit too thin for what it is...

Has that Old Rasputin smell and flavor amped up with the barrel...just. .doesn't seem big enough?"
2412,brentk56,Old Rasputin XXV (Aged in Bourbon Barrels),4.17,"Appearance: The midnight brown liquid is capped by a two finger beige head that slowly dissipates; squiggles of lacing

Smell: Baker's chocolate and roast wth licorice and dried dark dried fruit tones; a subtle hint of Bourbon

Taste: The Bourbon cuts into the malt flavors and keeps the initial chocolate and licorice sweetness in check; dried plum tones add to the complexity, with the Bourbon, oak and vanilla returning in the finish; a bit of a burn from the ABV

Mouthfeel: Medium to full body with moderate carbonation; some warmth in the gullet

Overall: The mouthfeel is a bit thin for an 11%+ stout but I do like the flavors; the Bourbon seems a bit understated compared to the last time I had this"
2413,jzeilinger,Old Rasputin XXV (Aged in Bourbon Barrels),4.08,"A - Black pour with dense, toffee colored cream resting on top.

S - Toasted cocoa, light Bourbon, delicate vanilla, and light oak on the nose. 

T - Toasted cocoa, Bourbon, vanilla, oak and light astringent from the malt while finishing on the sweeter side w/mild Bourbon.

M - Thick and robust body, leaves a sticky residue on the lips, warming in the back of the throat.

O - Solid."
2414,RyanK252,Hop Growers Tribute Series: CLS Farms,4.07,"Bottle poured into a Russian River Brewing Co pub glass

A: Pours golden straw yellow with a frothy off white head that settles to a firm layer and laces quite nicely. 

S: Citrus, resinous pine, grassy, light tropical and stone fruit, a touch of peppery spice, floral notes, and crackery biscuity malt. 

T: Spicy resinous pine, citrus zest, grapefruit, lemon, and mandarin orange, earthy herbal notes, underlying tropical and stone fruit, pineapple, pear, apricot, watermelon, peach, passion fruit, papaya, and a hint of plum, somewhat grassy, light floral notes, crackery biscuity malt, and a fairly dry finish. 

M: A little on the lighter side of medium body, moderate carbonation, crisp yet soft and creamy.

O: This one grew on me. The initial sips were a bit abrasive and I'm not typically big on the fruity notes that El Dorado brings, but as it warmed up it all came together."
2415,NickSMpls,Hop Growers Tribute Series: CLS Farms,4.26,"Pours a very pale yellow amber, with a light head. Aroma is piney with forest dankness. Taste is very smooth - starts off with a pronounced bitterness which carries through on the finish to the very end eith some background flavors of plums and figs. Dry body. Lightly carbonated and very drinkable at 6.5% ABV

A great IPA with 100% sourced Yakima hops."
2416,sjrider,Hop Growers Tribute Series: CLS Farms,4.23,"Bottle pour - almost clear pale lemony yellow with foamy white head leaving frosty lacing. Nose is floral, grassy and dank with citrus notes. Taste follows with a bit of pine and lots of citrus that lingers on the finish. Nicely done."
2417,jrc1093,Hop Growers Tribute Series: CLS Farms,4.19,"Bottled on 9/7/23; consumed on 10/16/23

Pours a clear, straw-gold body capped with three fingers of airy, soapy, eggshell-white foam; good head retention yields a finger of cap, large, frothy collar, and generous array of webby lacing trickling down the walls of the glass.

Aromas of sticky grapefruit and intense florality steadily welcome orange oils and fresh resins, with wet grass residuals meeting piney waves on the latter half of the bouquet.

Taste offers pine and subtler grapefruit rind upfront, with a touch of orange zest settling atop a flaky malt foundation as floral undertones and a slight note of dew-soaked grass touch the back end.

Mouthfeel brings a lighter body and arounded, effortless fluff of higher-end carbonation; soft, flaky texturing guides to glossy resins over the mid-palate and an airy bittering on the back end, leaving shreds of earthy grot meandering through an otherwise clean finish.

Fragrant greenery with a floral focus and distant citrus inflections emphasize a sort of rustic pseudo-perfumery, and a fresh-hop ale at its finest; a delicate, easy-drinking ode to the 'greenest' iterations of the style."
2418,TheWaySheGoes,Hop Growers Tribute Series: CLS Farms,4.53,"Wow, this one surprised me. Sweet, pillowy, and cotton candy aroma aroma coming off it at first smell. Call me crazy but I got some wild desert spices coming through on the tastes. Sage and pine hit the tongue first and then it's gone. Medium mouthfeel and very smooth. There is a creaminess too. Just a fantastic unique beer. It wont punch you in the face with dankness, instead it guides you. You can tell theres two elements. The spice profile hits first, and then the creaminess puts you at ease. My first time trying Zappa hops and I'm a happy customer. Not a cohesive beer, but very enjoyable nonetheless due to the uniqueness. It just works."
2419,Jugs_McGhee,Hop Growers Tribute Series: CLS Farms,3.74,"510ml brown glass bottle bottled 09/07/23.

Melon, juicy fruit, passionfruit, citrus, faint pine needle, subdued strawberry. Not too pulpy (as El Dorado hopped IPAs often can be).

Pungent with a coating mouthfeel.

A rather well balanced IPA with a very pleasant approachable hop profile. Also unfortunately a rather pricey beer. It's another winner from Russian River, and well worth trying if you can stomach the price.

High B / GOOD"
2420,LiquidAmber,Hop Growers Tribute Series: CLS Farms,4.24,"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a light to medium golden amber with a fine, one finger white head with great retention and lacing. Aroma of pale malt, citrus and lightly grassy hops, lemon, mixed stone fruit and a hint of pine. Flavor is pale malt, citrus and piney hops, lemon, grapefruit, pine, hints of orange and melon. Finishes with pine and citrus rind and good bitterness. Medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess. A solid IPA as expected from Russian River, not quite as aromatic as Pliny, fresh and herbal, not too different from the fresh hops I've been drinking this month. A nice hop bill that leans to West Coast with solid citrus and pine, but also fleeting flavors of other fruit. Very nice. These hops traveled from just east of my residence to California and back in fine form."
2421,beergoot,Hop Growers Tribute Series: CLS Farms,4.33,"Yellow body, clear; excellent carbonation, small-bubble and slowly rising; thick head, white, spongy, long-lasting. Huge floral and tropical fruit aroma; pineapple; lemon bread. Incredibly complex and balanced flavor; deft touch of lemon and white bread crust; honey dew melon; medium-light dose of lingering hop bitterness. Medium-heavy body; softly scratchy on the palate.

I was stoked to find a new type of Russian River on the shelves. I was not disappointed. This is a very tasty, nicely nuanced, and easy drinking American India pale ale. I will find a couple more bottles.

2422,ZippyThePinhead,Hop Growers Tribute Series: CLS Farms,4.56,"I guess I am a little embarrased that I can't discern what hops went into this (the label gives no indication). I don't have a sophisticated palate where I get notes of some obscure orange, or that sort of thing. It's got a pleasant nose and it seems a bit drier (less malty) than Pliny the Elder. The finish is quick and that is appreciated; unlike some IPAs that linger on the tongue long after, this give you some hop flavor and aroma, and then it is gone. No residual bitterness or lingering aftertaste. 6.5% ABV is good with me, because as they say, one's not enough, two is too many, and three's just right."
2423,Thankin_Hank,Hop Growers Tribute Series: CLS Farms,4.39,Hop Growers pours a yellow tinted lager color with a fabulous floral aroma and nice head. It’s got a hint of citrus with the flavorful floral and finishes dry. Tasty and dry. Bottled 090723 via California.
2424,beercam,Hop Growers Tribute Series: CLS Farms,4.46,"Really nice showcase of cls’ hops out of yakima. Petulant, simple children will only be capable of comparing this to Pliny, but there’s more to be had here. It’s nothing like it. It’s a 6.5% strawberry piney alium exploration. Some nice melon vibes even. The herbal, dank garden notes are very unique and clean and tasty. Pours a very clear, golden straw color. Curtains of sticky lace are left down the glass and a pure white cap sticks around, receding into an active 3mm rim. Great balance and restraint here. and fuck’s sake, take a hike if you’re looking for pliny in this. It’s not supposed to be remotely similar. Cheers"
2425,RaulMondesi,Hop Growers Tribute Series: CLS Farms,3.54,"It’s a shame. This one is that Wimpy kid in PE class that couldn’t even do one pull up. And given that this is from Russian River, it gives me a tear. In comparison, Pliny is like that wanna be Rambo kid who always climbs to the top of the pole, and does way more sit ups than necessary to get an A. But this one here… it’s not even the whale-like kid who doesn’t even try. Hop Growers jumps on the pull up bar, but just can’t pull himself up."

2427,Gatch,Flood Relief IPA,4.47,"Bottom of the can says “Alchemist” and has a date of 08-02-23, so not ideal and not the freshest, but thanks to judkinst for holding a can for me for months. Flavor doesn’t seem to be diminished at all. Truly phenomenal NEIPA without being a chalky hazy mess. Has fresh hop IPA vibes but that’s just the stellar NZ hops. Bravo!"
2428,drdiesel9483,Flood Relief IPA,4.18,"Look - slight haze gold nice rimming
Smell - caramel malts and citrus

Overall - pretty nice classic IPA non bitter and grains"
2429,mothman,Flood Relief IPA,4.35,"Side by side with HF version. Alchemist gets the slight nod. Both are excellent!

Alchemist has their house ipa flavor, think heady, maybe focal. Dank, pine, weed. Very hoppy and nice bitterness.

HF version is pretty similar but has a bit more New Zealand hop profile and some stone fruit. Floral, earthy, soft, bitterness in the finish."
2430,brentk56,Flood Relief IPA,4.6,"Appearance: Pours a somewhat cloudy golden color capped by a two finger head; good retention with squiggles and clumps of lacing

Smell: Dank and piney with citrus pith and peach tones

Taste: There is a floral peach and orange blossom aspect that hits the palate, at the outset, and persists through the finish; the dankness builds, in the middle, and provides solid bitterness to the finish, as well 

Mouthfeel: Medium to full body with moderate to high carbonation

Overall: The combination of the floral and the bitter is a real accomplishment that I don't think I have tasted before"
2431,GreesyFizeek,Flood Relief IPA,4.49,"Can purchased and drank at The Alchemist Brew Café in Stowe, VT.

This one pours slightly hazy burnt orange color, with a small head, and lots of lacing.

This smells like peach, melon, marijuana, orange, and grapefruit.

This feels like a bit of a softer, more subtle Focal Banger. There’s some solid bitterness, but much less than the typical Alchemist beer, with a sweet peachy and citrusy hop character. There’s no real maltiness here.

This is light bodied, clean, crisp, and quite drinkable.

This doesn’t dethrone either Focal Banger or Heady Topper, but it’s for a great cause and it also tastes pretty great."
2432,Pieman-Philly,Flood Relief IPA,3.91,"First review for me! Purchased from the Alchemist on a trip to Vermont. From a Can, opened 8/6. Having not tried Hill Farmstead before this is a very good IPA and for a great cause."
2433,bubseymour,Sunday (2023),4.39,"Nice aroma and flavor is great but it’s beyond too sweet. Coconut added that butter perfect mouthfeel. Overall it’s a great pastry, but so darn sweet only really enjoyed in a small oz serving."
2434,REVZEB,Sunday (2023),4.26,"Smudgy dark brown pour, tan ring. Nose is laced with bourbon and molasses, supporting coconut, caramel, vanilla and barley in that order. Taste is boozy first and foremost, then the barrel candy phase sets in with notes of bourbon soaked oak backing molasses, coconut, vanilla, toasted caramel, and raisin. Feel is warm, with sharp barrel felt more than booze, otherwise thick and smooth. A heavy dessert barleywine with a boozy edge that demands you sip slowly but has a sneaky depth to it"
2435,TreyIsWilson,Sunday (2023),4.45,"A - Pours dark brown with a one fizzy tan head. The heads fades extremely fast leaving some light oily lacing.

S - Aroma is coconut, brown sugar, toffee and borubon.

T - The taste is caramel, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla, coconut and a warming bourbon finish.

M - Full body with medium carbonation. Soft mouthfeel with a slick dry finish.

O - Really well done barleywine. The coconut is present, but not overpowering. Dig it."
2436,DIM,Sunday (2023),4.41,"This right here is a straight up barrel aged mounds barwine. I get strong chocolate covered caramel alongside lots of raw and deeply toasted coconut. Saturating this liquid candy bar are immensely satisfying brownest of the brown liquor notes and a hint of vanilla. The body is wonderfully sticky with gentle carbonation. This is intensely sweet, lacking subtlety or sophistication but damn is it good.

Very different from last year's and not quite as enjoyable to me but definitely worth trying."
2437,Luscious_Malfoy,Sunday (2023),4.6,"poured from a 22oz bomber into a TG DBA tumbler. pours like muddied puddle water with some light coconut flecks on top. no foam or head. some bubbles to go along with the flecks that fizz and then fizzle away. bourbon, oak, toffee, caramel and coconut on the nose. more chocolate in the taste than on the nose but man is there barrel galore on this bad boy. full, thick, sticky mouthfeel. pleasantly surprised with this one. not sure why as i love cycle but barleywine is an inherently sweet beer to begin with, so add coconut and that just amplified the sweetness. however, the barrel not only cuts through but also adds layers of complexity. overall, this rocked."
2438,mschrei,Sunday (2023),4.6,"This one is awesome. Sweet, but not overly so with the coconut. Strong booze presence, but the burn is mild on the back end. Clean, not thick but a bit syrupy. I love their daily beers, and this one is no exception."
2439,WunderLlama,Doomfire,4.29,"16 oz Can dated 8 7 23, opened 11.5.23, poured into a pretentious beer glass

Brewers notes; Doomfire pours a brilliant hazy gold, inspired by the otherworldly hues we witness from the brewdeck, day in, day out. Liberally hopped with select Citra, Galaxy, and experimental lots (HBC 1019), this beer showcases exuberant notes of sticky mango, tangelo and ripe pineapple. These flavors sit atop a foundation of creamy malt, with a crisp finish. Doomfire celebrates new inventions born from yesterday’s forge. 

Hazy orange liquid, tapped by a two finger off white foam cap, dense solid and stays there after five minutes 

Aroma is tropical fruits, mango, pineapple, 

Taste is bubblegum, tropical, mango, pineapple

Smooth, soft mouthfeel with a hop kiss

Good beer"
2440,papposilenus,Doomfire,4.48,"From a 16oz can, dated 08/07/23. Served in a spiegelau IPA glass.

Pours a cloudy, semi-opaque pale orange with two fingers of soft, soapy suds. Retention is excellent, leaving a puckered and pouffy cap and a tattered curtain of sticky lacing.

Nose is sharp and rindy. Aromas of grapefruit, aromatic wood and… there’s almost a coconut and cocoa, sort of Mounds bar-like character - which is obviously not right but I can’t talk myself out of smelling it.

Taste is pithy and rindy with lots of citric bitterness. Tasting grapefruit, underripe pineapple, orange peel, mango skins and guava and, God help me, I know there isn’t supposed to be anything in here that typically expresses coconut but, I taste woody, husky, coconut. Both minimal sweetness and unusually high bitterness relative to what I expect in a Tree House NEDIPA.

Feel is clean and juicy with a creamy, medium body and bright, zesty carbonation. Probably unimprovable, mouthfeel-wise. And, for bonus points, there’s just a little bit of lupulin stickiness on the lips to remember it by when it’s gone.

A typical Tree House NEDIPA in appearance and mouthfeel but with an untypical, unusually gratifying, high level of bitterness. Nice. Maybe I was just really in the mood but this punched all my buttons."
2441,agreenman19,Doomfire,4.37,"L - bright yellow yeastiness. Looks like hop puree. Reminds me a bit of Headroom. 

S - satsuma, pithy clementine, and white bread. 

T - wheaty and hop-laden. Splash of pink grapefruit and a mostly grassy hop sweetness. Pulp-free orange juice and faint pineapple bite. Finishes dry and bitter. 

F - smooth like a smoothie. Just got a new Ninja blender and dat bitch be blendin'. Shit. 

O - a different kind of TH beer that may not resonate with the usual juice bomb crowd. However, it has a strong backbone and delivers in its purpose. You may not like it, but this is what diversity looks like."
2442,hopsputin,Doomfire,4.21,"a: bright hazy burnt orange color with a frothy, vibrant white 1 finger head

s: sweet orange juice and mango sorbet upfront. pineapple, candied lemon followed by strawberry kiwi. a hint of sugar and sweet bread. a little vanilla and tangerines

t: tons and tons of mango in your face right away. some sweet generic citrus and a bit of pineapple. some big peach juice notes behind that and candied apricots. tangerines and guava. a touch of sugary sweetness behind that. maybe a little bit of grapefruit at the end

m: creamy, fluffy medium mouthfeel with low carbonation. slightly sticky

o: this is a really nice NEDIPA. it's a bit sticky-sweet, but it is so smooth it's ridiculous"
2443,ovaltine,Doomfire,4.35,"Pours a turbid pineapple color with luxurious, creamy white head that laces the glass nicely. This beer is so thick in appearance, it literally swallows light like a black hole.

The nose features lots of mango, pineapple, and a spicy note that approximates coriander, along with a sweet oat aroma. Very interesting.

The mango and pineapple are the dominant flavors, and they’re delicious, with a significant sweetness from the oats, and that coriander note presents as tart tangerine, especially as the beer warms, with a peppery note at the back of the palate. I did NOT see that coming.

The mouthfeel is surprisingly crisp for a Tree House hazy, but works really well. This is not the typical TH “juicy, fruity hazy.” It goes in unexpected directions that I really appreciate as a world class brewery flexing its substantial creative brewing muscles. Really glad I could try this."
2444,GreesyFizeek,Sphere,4.4,"This one pours a very hazy golden yellow color, with a small head, and lots of lacing.

This smells pretty citrusy, with peach, melon, and pineapple.

This certainly isn’t the first, and won’t be the last beer that’s hopped with Citra and Galaxy. But it’s got that thing going on, with tons of tropical and citrusy notes, and a real peachy soft vibe.

This is soft, medium bodied, and very creamy, with a nice drinkability.

It’s super common at this point that I’m going to love a Tree House beer these days."
2445,Jw13,Sphere,4.28,"My second beer using the new yeast, after Satin, and there's a strong similarity between the two. Not just hazy, this one pours milky yellow/orange. Nose is more muted than is usual for Treehouse, but it got stronger as the beer warmed, with the Galaxy being very noticeable. 

Taste is of generic fruit, with lots of astringent rind. That rind is what makes it a little different from a hundred other NEIPAs, but there's nothing about it that screams ""Treehouse"".

In summary, a competent NE(D)IPA, but nothing I'd go out of way for (which puts it below most Treehouse beers)."
2446,TheDoctor,Sphere,4.25,"Serving: Can
Canned: Jul-21-2023
Consumed: Aug-11-2023

Pours milky white-yellow with a middling head. The aroma is fairly punchy upon popping the can. Generic tropical fruit. Once in the glass, however--while still nice-smelling--this punchiness is a bit diminished and still just generically fruity. The flavor has a bit more of a thin bitterness than expected or suggested by the nose. This lingers into the finish. Not quite ""juicy"" either in taste, smell or body. The mouthfeel is along similar lines. A little fluffiness, but not quite as luxurious as I am used to with their beers. A little astringency but not quite astringent. It feels weird to not just pound in my normal 4.75s for look and feel on a TH beers. We're in strange times...
When I saw what they were doing for the Data Set series I was bummed I'd missed it, but I am really glad to be able to taste what came out the other end (Thanks, Papillon senses!). 

Still, not a fan. First off, maybe it's the power of suggestion, however as a fanboy I REALLY wanted to like it so where does that leave us? Secondly, this was a little on the older side yet not only did none of what I picked up jibe with age, but at the brewery I had a very fresh one with the same yeast and got the same overall impression; on a different day, in a different setting. Finally, the other beer I had (Velvet) was all new-fangled hops that I don't have much experience with. However, this one was good old standbys that not only do I know well but I know well specifically in TH beers. 

What it all comes down to for me is that whether it's a good biotransforming yeast strain(s) or not, the ester profile is sorely, sorely missed and in its place there is an ever-so-slight astringency (not the most adequate word, maybe hollowness?) to the hop character that takes away from the beer. I am far from an expert but have had a lot of their beers at multiple stages of my life as a beer nerd and their life as a brewery. That first smell and drink of a TH beer is always obviously a TH beer and it has always been exquisite. This one was not obviously theirs in that sense and was ""very good"" at best. No audible gasps here. That's a first for me (or in this case a second after Velvet). 

Anyway, I am extremely happy to have tried this. It was a really educational experience. It reinforces my belief that even though you can load something down with hops and get something delicious, in the best of NEIPAs the yeast's ester profile is doing at least as much for the overall character. If you count biotransformation, maybe even more. 
So, as they say: If it ain't broke don't fix it.

2450,Damian,Way Outside the Lines - Barrel Aged,4.22,"Drank from a 1 pint .9 fl oz (500 ml) bottle purchased at Trillium Brewing Company, Boston, MA
Served in a tulip

Glossy, pitch black appearance. Dense and viscous looking in the glass. Used motor oil definitely came to mind. The liquid was topped by a small, mocha colored crown that quickly transformed into a lasting, medium sized collar. There was no lacing however.

The aroma was impressive. Really interesting and complex. Cardamom and cinnamon notes came through big time and worked surprisingly well. Loads of sweet vanilla too. Mocha notes were also apparent. Nice melding of medium roast coffee and a touch of milk chocolate. Moderate roasted malt presence as well. A touch of booziness appeared as the beer warmed, but the barrel presence was hardly noticeable.

The flavor profile was similar to the nose but not as rounded. Malty and robust. Big roasted malt presence up front. Good dose of sweet caramel malts too. Brown sugar was also noticeable. Cinnamon and cardamom came through strong in the center. Loads of vanilla and chocolate fudge as well. Hint of lactose-like creaminess. Dark roast coffee appeared on the back end and carried into the finish. Lots of roasted malt character too. A sharp booziness lingered on the swallow. There was also a metallic note here initially, but it dissipated after the beer opened up. Like in the nose, the bourbon barrel presence was almost undetectable.

Excellent dense, oily, full bodied mouthfeel. Creamy, slick and smooth on the palate. The liquid contained a super fine, mellow effervescence that worked nicely for the style.

All in all, Way Outside the Lines - Barrel Aged is a solid imperial stout with some nice spice notes that set this apart from your typical BA stout. My only knock against this was that the barrel presence was far too subtle, especially given the price point. Trillium X Omnipollo collaborations usually deliver, but this beer was merely middle of the pack."

2452,WunderLlama,Way Outside the Lines - Barrel Aged,4.41,"Notes: An immensely robust, roasty stout base is dosed with colossal levels of Madagascar vanilla beans & Barrington Trillium Blend Coffee followed by the uniquely delicious addition of Cardamom. Seductive aromatics of chocolate cake, vanilla cream, cinnamon, and freshly brewed coffee beckons from the glass. For an additional layer of oaky complexity, we conditioned this beauty of a beer in bourbon barrels for 10 months. Full bodied with light sweetness and balancing bitterness.

Tastes like rich dark chocolate, creamy vanilla, robust coffee, sweet bourbon, oak barrel, caramel, toasty toffee, mild hops, a hint of cinnamon spice, with a big beautiful cardamom addition.

Appearance: Pours a nearly completely hazy (5-10% clarity) light and pale golden color with a massive white head that lingers. (4.00)

Aroma: Strong aromas of lemon and lime citrus, guava, passionfruit with some zesty pineapple. Citrus rind underneath. (4.25)

Flavor: Strong flavors of lemon lime citrus, guava, passionfruit, some hints of zesty pineapple and sweetness. Citrus and juice lingers. Some yeast on the end and finish is surprisingly dry. (4.25)

I'm gonna suggest you pair this outstanding brewski with Please Come to Boston by Dave Loggins which reached #5 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1974. That's not only ironic but also a strong combo. Enjoy!"
2464,Rug,Data Set #5,4.35,"Canned 3/3023. “Was that real blood?” stamped on the bottom of the can

I was intrigued by the weirdness of Data Set #6 with Nordic yeast (my first of the series) the other day that I had to grab this one as well. I gotta be honest, using a English yeast doesn’t seem like it’ll produce a result too far off from their typical NEIPAs, but I’m excited regardless. Let’s get into it

Pours a hazy pale gold with 3 fingers of soapy white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing

The nose is pretty much standard fare for them, just a bit more “classic” for lack of a better word. I’m picking up on aromas of overripe cantaloupe, orange marmalade, bready malt, earthy hops, grass, black tea, light peach, and pineapple juice

The difference in yeast is more evident in taste, it’s still juicy but in a way that’s brighter. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting orange zest, red grapefruit, bready malt, grassy hops, lemon zest, overripe cantaloupe, and light white pepper. The swallow brings notes of lemon zest, red grapefruit, grassy hops, crackery malt, pineapple juice, light weed, and raw grain

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a slick beer. Finishes neutral and juicy

This is just an all around great NEIPA. The yeast isn’t particularly special, but it adds a nice bright touch to it"
2465,WunderLlama,Data Set #5,4.04,"Brewers Notes: The Data Set series is our endeavor to explore a broad spectrum of yeast and how they affect the flavor outcome of our style of beer.For this iteration, we used another British yeast variety from across the pond. It’s easy to overlook how various European brewing cultures helped pave the way and acclimate our palates to hoppy beer. Hop connoisseurs have certainly encountered this British powerhouse that has quietly been the backbone of numerous hop forward brews.The hallmarks of this yeast are its appealing haze, fruity esters and a sweet finish that helps to balance copious dry hopping. Pithy grapefruit flits between eye-opening pine resin before fading into pleasant notes of marmalade.

Hazy yellow liquid by a one finger white frothy crown , settles to a layer

Soft mouthfeel , good sudsing, some hop bite on the f8nish

2466,Takeahike1,Data Set #5,3.95,"Ovaltine and Roguer have some good notes on this one. Actually, as I continue to drink through this beer, the initial bitterness that I noticed at first (a little less than pleasing) has faded and melded into the overall flavor profile. Really smooth now. Very nice beer. If I close my eyes and drink it, it almost tastes like an English cream ale (if there is such a thing)."
2467,ovaltine,Data Set #5,4.6,"Pours a very hazy pineapple with the most delectable creamy white head you’ve ever seen. Gorgeous hazy. I get lots of mango, guava, and grapefruit rind on the nose, and maybe a smidge of banana? Interesting.

The taste has all parts of the aforementioned mango, guava, and grapefruit - very juicy and tropical - and there is indeed a very cool banana flavor which is PHENOMENAL.

Smooth and creamy mouthfeel per usual with Tree House hazies, this and #4 are my favorites from the Data Set family, with #6 yet to go. I couldn’t choose between the two if you paid me to, because they’re both world class in their own right, IMHO."
2468,Roguer,Data Set #5,4.54,"Strong head production and good retention.

Nose is quite different from #1 (or #2 or #4, for that matter). It's clearly an IPA, with fruity hops leading the way, along with some pine and green herbs, but there's a distinct musty quality to the nose. It's a very pleasant aroma, but not quite what you'd expect from a Tree House IIPA, and not as explosive as their juicier hop bombs.

Wonderfully expressive on the palate, with a huge hit of banana, guava, and melon leading the way. Very tropical, dominated by yeast esters. Perhaps the smoothest presentation of the four I have tried (including #1, #2, and #4), and the sweetness of the expression is both a good match for Tree House's use of hops, and an interesting departure from the mustier, almost duller nose. Clear notes of grapefruit peel on the back third and finish; very pleasantly bitter, not unlike a WC IPA's finish.

Smooth and creamy.

This is perhaps my favorite Data Set so far (with two to go), or very close. The yeast is a surprisingly great match for the hop blend, and creates perhaps the most interesting overall flavor profile."

T: initially a slightly sweet, bready, malty arrival, turning slightly sulfury, with honey-drizzled bread, then bitter, floral, noble hops on the finish. 

M: rich, but well-attenuated. Moderate carbonation, keeps it popping. Clean, almost astringent finish. Feels lighter, more like a German Pilsner.

O: tastes like a Bohemian Pilsner, feels like a German Pilsner. Reminds me of the first time I had Pilsner Urquell, or Weihenstephaner Original. Even that Old Seattle lager. Really a masterpiece of balance. Rich, malty, and loaded with noble hops. Right up my alley. Wish I could get it at home. Like many great Pilsners, greater than the sum of its parts."
2476,Beginner2,Pilsner,4.15,"While New Glarus is sold only-in-Wisconsin and yet is world-famous for their lambic-like fruit beers, I've always considered many NG lagers to be world class ranging from the blonde (Two Women) through the middle Marzen (Staghorn) to darks (Uff-Dah!). And that just might be high-praise coming from a malt-head like me.

So with my dis-comfort zone for lagers starting around 25 IBU, along comes this 35 IBU pils and I barely notice the hops until they linger in the finish; much like a balanced brew should. More noticeable is what a six week sit in the lagerer does. (Other brewers might claim that long, but they can't match what this sit did for clean complexity.)

A question I have for NGBC.... I drank your Hometown Blonde in my pre-BA career, so I can't remember it and took no notes. But how close is this Pilsner to Hometown Blonde? What did you learn from her?

7/16/23 Regretting I only bought a single copy of Pilsner on my recent beer run to Woodman's Kenosha, I opened my sampler box and found more Pilsner ! I like it so much, I might even buy some remainders during my annual run to satisfy my Staghorn fix. Until then, NG remains my second most favored brewer... even if they are only in Wisconsin. Prost !"

2496,ATL6245,Maibock,4.5,"Appearance: Very slightly hazy gold, white fluffy head with good retention.

Aroma: Floral and herbal hops, grainy malt.

Flavor: Spicy, herbal and peppery. Noticeable alcohol. Low bitterness. Low sweetness.

Mouthfeel: Starts soft but ends drying, moderate carbonation, medium length finish.

Overall: Right on specs. Has more hoppy character than some: spicy, herbal and peppery hops prominent. Good malt backbone, provides balance. Grainy and bready. Alcohol is warming but not too much so. Clean finish. It starts out with a soft mouthfeel but transitions to dry pretty quickly. This actually reminds me of a strong Festbier (like Weihenstephaner or Paulaner), but that's not a bad thing. First class."
2497,BubbleBobble,Maibock,4.52,"Pours a clear, very light copper with big 1"" head, very good retention and lacing. Nose is very fresh hop off the bat - much more than expected - before more caramel and toffee notes come through after a few minutes. Still, pretty grassy and floral even after settling down. Taste, however, has much more of a Maibock feel to it - toffee and caramel (though not very sweet), a little nutty, with long, bitter and floral finish. Mouthfeel is rather soft with light carbonation. Overall, this was a really enjoyable beer and was excited to try it!"
2498,Tolianych_Pivomnabuhanych,Maibock,5,"Gotta say I was not sure about trying this one. Two very different breweries from two different continents with two different yet strangely similar vibes. This one is a winner, ladies and gents.

Everything about this Maibock collab is excellent. Rich golden color, a very inviting aroma, a deceptively smooth taste from start to finish. Crisp, floral hops, light malt, definitely a recognizable yet delicate 7.4% ABV presence. 

One more fan here."
2499,jlindros,Maibock,4.46,"Pours a frothy fizzy 1/2 finger head with good retention, sticky lacing, very clear slightly haze pale color

Nose has a ton of fresh grainy-sweet pilsner malt, a lot like a fresh Helles up front, raw bread dough, grain, cereal, straw, plenty of malt depth complexity of decoction mash, a bit of corn, touch of herbal floral hop

Taste again brings a ton of that fresh malt, big juicy malt, grainy-sweet pilsner malt, more cereal, bread dough, straw, a bit of corn, nice grainy-sweet rich malt with more of that layered decoction malty complexity, a hint of smooth alcohol, fair herbal floral hops with a light bitterness, getting a bit spicy on the soft lager finish, lingering med-light spicy hop bitterness

Mouth is med to a bit fuller bod, just a hint of alcohol warmth, med-higher frothy carb

Overall this was very nice, great decoction mash, great malt richness, great hop kick especially at the back, brings a bit of the bock character as well, I can't believe I have missed out on this beer, it's great."
2500,tekstr1der,Maibock,4.4,"Schilling fanboi here, so this was an exciting find. Wow, does it pack in a ton features: gorgeous pour with dense, persistent white cap, amazing aromas & rich flavors, balanced finish. Very much wish I'd grabbed more than a single. I'll find more."
2501,Darkmagus82,Maibock,4.31,"Poured from a 500 ml bottle into a pint glass 
Appearance – The beer pours a clear golden amber color with a small head of puffy white foam. The head has a decent level of retention, fading over time and leaving a bit of foamy lace on the sides of the glass. 
Smell – The aroma is huge of a bready and grainy smell mixed with lots of harvest fruit and a bit of yeastiness. Along with these smells comes a decent showing of herbal smells mixed with some grass and a bit of mustiness. 
Taste – The taste starts out with a big doughy and bready flavor mixed with some yeast and a decent showing of a caramel and harvest fruit sweetness. Along with these tastes comes a nice showing of hop (at least for the style) with some herbal and earthy hop. At the same time, there are notes of spice as well as a touch of hay. As the taste advances, some grass and more herb join in, all the while the maltiness gets more intense at the expense of the sweet, leaving one with a nice malty, but nicely hopped and still rather clean taste to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is slightly more chewy and thick, with a carbonation level that is moderate. For the tastes and styles the feel is nice and makes for a nice sipper.
Overall - A very nice and flavorful Maibock. One I will certainly go back to again and one to certainly seek out if you are a fan of Maibocks!"
2502,Smakawhat,Maibock,4.42,"Poured from the bottle into a Libbey style pilsner glass.

Deep brass yellow color, with a mirror like shine. Crystal clear body with slow rising mix of pinhead to fine rising linear carbonation. Head is a fluffy and pillow white cream of three fingers, with even some decent retention. Real nice looking beer.

Exceptionally clean aroma, giving to a dryness that isn't flour or parching like smelling. Toast malts, and even hints of roasted nuts on this which is real impressive. Minimal hop presence but certainly not complaining.

Real powerful and impressive palate. Just a great rich mouthfeel with a honey like coating. Mild caramel mixing with a great pine like hop and grass herbal quality on first sip. Cruising honey tones, with a big mix of balanced spruce tip like pine cone hop flavor on the finish. Clean, rich, mixing sharp bitterness with great sweetness.

Really impressive maibock even if I am a little out of season here."
2503,BeerAndGasMasks,Maibock,3.74,"From the half liter bottle, it pours a clear yellow-golden color with a nice white head that slowly reduces and leaves lacing. Scent is pleasant, with notes of honey and citrus evident. The taste follows the nose, with crystal malts, honey and spice coming through. It has a medium body, with a somewhat sharp, annoying, aftertaste - I have two bottles of this, and will compare with the second.."
2504,Bierman9,Maibock,4.25,"Picked up a 0.5l bottle at Craft Beer Cellar in Waterbury while vacationing there at the end of July. Best before info not found and price not noted...

Poured into a Willi Becher, it's a clear, vibrant, medium-golden color. Has sparse carbo and a thin, creamy, fine white head. Carbo is decent overall. Smell is of bready, crackery malts with medium sweetness. Has some light, pale fruit notes as well. Body is a nice medium, with a fairly smooth feel. 

Taste follows aroma, with lovely, lightly sweet malts highlighting crackers, toasted bread and cookie dough. Has some pear and green apple action as well. Solid!!

2506,MonDak_Joe1953,Maibock,4.18,"500ml bottle, marked '1 PINT 0.9 FL OZ'. No dating information found.
Clear, pale gold colored body. Big, pillowy off white head upon pouring, which recedes but is long lasting as a cap. Leaves behind a few patterns of lacing.
Aroma is malty, fruity, and herbal.
Taste is initially abrupt but mellows with repeated sips. Dark toasted malts, with a honey sweetness, blend with a strong earthy, vegetal flavor. Honey sweetened malt lingers in the aftertaste.
Medium syrup mouthfeel. Coats the mouth. Excellent carbonation.
Sweet but strong flavored beer that is rewarding."
2507,papposilenus,Turbo,4.35,"From a 16oz can, dated 08/17/23. ‘You lika da juice?’ My guinea sensibilities are offended. Served in a spiegelau IPA glass.

Pours a hazy-cloudy orange juice-color with two-plus fingers of super-soft, fluffy head. Retention is excellent, leaving a puffball cap of shaving cream-like lather and a tattered curtain of sticky lacing.

Nose is sharp and citrusy. Aroma of oily orange peel.

Taste is both juicy and resinous with above average citric bitterness. Like the nose, predominant flavour note is bitter, oily orange peel with lesser notes of grapefruit juice and resinous pine, then a lot of that signature TH peachy yeast thing going into the finish, airier and more floral than usual and as much in the sinuses as on the palate.

Feel is juicy, sticky, a little lighter than medium bodied with bright, zesty carbonation. I know I already said sticky but it really is notably sticky. And a little boozier feeling maybe than I’d have expected even at 8.6%.

Overall, tasty and something different from the usual Tree House DIPA. It was obviously well executed and there’s no question I enjoyed it - as a novelty - but I doubt I’d add it to my regular rotation. For whatever that’s worth."
2508,Jw13,Turbo,4.35,"Pours cloudy yellow like a typical treehouse IPA. Smell is muted citrus; taste is intense grapefruit. Less complex than their ""modern"" IPAs, but very clean and enjoyable."
2509,CTBrewReview,Turbo,4.59,"Took a while to read the story in fine print on the can, but in summary this beer uses Cascade hops. The look is a nice light caramel color with a definite quick to disappear froth on top (poured into large open tulip glass). The smell is hard to get but might have a farm smell with notes of honeysuckle flowers. The taste is where things are different but in a good way. This beer tastes less fruity and more like a hazy IPA. So good but yet so different from the normal selection. The feel of the beer is also not chewy and like a traditional IPA. This beer was well conceived and Ii will be getting more on the next run to MA."
2510,SebastianOwl,Turbo,4.21,"Uses three types of Cascade hops, American, New Zealand and Australian, which in this case lack strong aroma but have a distinct taste."
2511,Damian,Condensed Matter,4.51,"Drank from a 500ml/1 pt. 0.9 fl.oz bottle purchased on Tavour
Release 2023
Batch *001*
Served in a tulip

The beer poured a fuller bodied, dark brown hue that bordered on black. Slightly thinner in body and lighter in color than I anticipated. A small, bubbly, saddle brown head topped the liquid, but it quickly transformed into a medium sized, lasting collar. There was no lacing whatsoever. In the glass, the beer looked surprisingly oily and viscous.

The aroma was interesting. Really rich, malty and robust. Quite sweet overall. Caramel malts came through strongest. Good dose of roasted malt character as well. Boozy bourbon notes were also apparent. There was an interesting spice note that was reminiscent of green pepper or ancho chile. Coffee was present but more subtle than I anticipated. A pleasant mocha-like note appeared as the beer warmed. Some vanilla was noticeable too.

The flavor profile was impressive and quite different from the aroma. Super malty and robust. Sweet but not excessively so. Big caramel malt presence up front. Bit of roasted malt character too. Coffee notes were apparent but slightly less so than I expected. Nice boozy bourbon character. There was an intense fruity sweetness in the center that was tough to peg but somehow reminded me of ripe berries and/or cherries. Rich chocolate fudge notes were also prominent. More lingering bourbon and caramel-like sweetness on the back end and in the finish.

The mouthfeel was rich and oily. Fuller bodied for the style. The liquid contained a super fine and subtle effervescence that turned slick and smooth on the palate. All in all, impressive for the style.

Condensed Matter is a rich, sweet, complex and surprisingly well balanced imperial pastry stout. I could imagine this working nicely as either a breakfast or a dessert beer."
2512,maximum12,Condensed Matter,3.97,"A 500ML bottle with a 2023 tag on the label. I do like Bottle Logic’s consistent theme on their labels. Classy & understated. 

Black. Interesting nose. Lactose is prominent, as is coffee, with a sharp, bitter edge. Could be the chicory? 

Condensed Matter is like some mutated coffee- adjacent drink. It’s big & thick, with a coating of chocolate around the edges & a heart of sweet condensed milk with pockets of biting coffee & gentle malt. Alcohol isn’t hidden so much as non-existent & the bourbon is more transcendent than present. It does lend itself to big gulps. 

An easy-drinking morning beer. And a very good one. The addition of some fiery spirits would kick this up a level, easy."
2513,REVZEB,Condensed Matter,4.54,"Pitch black body with two fingers of brown foam, traditionally pretty. Honestly it fits, because they nailed this one, exactly as envisioned. Nose features the unique coffee aromas with dark chocolate, vanilla and the vibrant chicory supporting. Taste has the coffee and chocolate become their own chrysalis that the vanilla, roasted malt, chicory and I swear a hint of honey surround and support. Not overly thick or heavy in the body and allows the coffee texture to star, sneaky earthy without being robust. Nice work here"
2514,dafla67,Condensed Matter,4.49,"Pours deep brown. Aroma coffee, chocolate and roastiness. Taste follows nose - an abundance of chocolate & coffee with sweetness. Medium mouthfeel. Wonderful stout."
2515,Herbabee,Condensed Matter,3.98,"Taking this in as part of a BL mixed haul... pours opaque raven and arrives flat in the snifter... nose definitely detects the coffee, dark chocolate, roasted malts, maybe even a bit of barrel... taste confirms the scent, but once again with this brewer, it's a bit too overblown on the sweetness to please my own palate."
2516,mschrei,Condensed Matter,4.53,"I like this one. Nose is sweet and strong with notes of coffee and barrel (I’d imagine the chicory is assertive too, but I don’t know what that smells like, to be honest). The coffee and roasted dark malt and lactose are strong on the taste as well. Medium to big bodied, full mouth watering feel, boozy buzz under current. Great beer for breakfast or dessert. These cats know how to barrel age a beer!"
2517,Luscious_Malfoy,Condensed Matter,4.49,"poured from a 500mL bottle into a TG DBA tumbler. pours dark brown with a thick dark khaki foam head. big barrel on the nose and taste. light coffee and even lighter cinnamon too. it’s definitely more of a sweeter coffee drink flavor profile but it’s good. never gets too sweet and lots of barrel to cut it and add to the complexity. medium-full mouthfeel. pretty soft and fluffy. interesting barrel-aged stout here. pretty easy drinking and on the lighter, sweeter side of things."

T-Follows the nose....burst of sweet tropical fruits and fruity hard candy......mango, Orange, greatfruit, guava, lemon drop

F- Sharp, crisp,prickly in a pleasant way....less the medium

O- Super good and refreshing...great fruity presence"
2519,agreenman19,Gust Of Guava,4.24,"L - not nearly as hazy as typical Tree House fare! Dull, opaque orange with a bright white head that leaves a spiderweb of lacing behind. Looks nice. 

S - immediate guava up front, as expected. Peach and bubblegum follow suit, with a splash of lemon candy. 

T - guava. Had to get that one out of the way. Quickly tamed by sweet orange slice candy and peach rings. Hint of vanilla and orange juice concentrate. Slightly dry and tangy on the finish. Lasting sensation is perhaps a touch too bitter. 

F - lighter than the ABV would imply. Almost watery, at least by TH standards, which means it's basically a creamy milkshake. Smooth as butter with a light grazing sensation. 

O - whereas typical TH guava bombs have a sugary, almost tart guava potency, this one feels mellowed out. Fuller and smoother. Still dominated by guava, but feels more balanced."
2520,lucius10,Gust Of Guava,4.22,"Sweet tropical fruity hoppy, hint of Simcoe hoppy, orange citrus, and a sweet and tart peachy-guava nose on this one!

2521,tigg924,Gust Of Guava,4.88,"Had on tap at Charlton. Pours ultra hazy, orange brown in color with one quarter inch head. Taste is big guava, mango, and candied orange. Medium body, moderate low carbonation, slightly bitter. This is insanely good. Can really taste Hurricane and the extra guava. The base beer is not lost. So much more than a fruit bomb. Will get again."
2522,ovaltine,Curiosity One Hundred Thirty Three,4.35,"Pours a murky pineapple color with a creamy white head that provides significant lacing - and floaties, as in LOTS of floaties. I don’t ever recall seeing that in a Tree House beer.

The nose is fairly dank and features mango, peaches, white grapes, and ripe oranges. Very tropical aromas and quite juicy (if aromas can be juicy).

The taste is a mirror of the nose, with the mango and peaches most notable for me, with ripe oranges and white grapes providing a delicious complement to those flavors.

The full, soft mouthfeel is the TH staple, and works well with this excellent hazy."
2523,brewandbbq,Curiosity One Hundred Thirty Three,4.3,"16oz can dated 7/23/23.

Pours cloudy gold with an inch-plus head of white. Plenty of tattered lacing and persistent retention. Unripe peach, mango, orange in the nose. Medium bodied with a soft mouthfeel. Tropical and juicy on the palate with minimal malt or bitterness. Orange, peach, mango. Finishes juicy and ripe."
2524,StonedTrippin,Head Full of Fresh Hops (2023): Citra,3.99,"shame on me for kind of losing track of this one in the beer fridge, obviously was not designed to hang out in there for several months, but its still doing alright, and was an enjoyable drink last night, even if i know its faded and degraded some, dang. peachy pale brassy colored beer with a huge creamy inch of lasting white head, like beaten egg whites. the bottom of the can, maybe the last inch, has some almost sandy looking sediment, but its uniform is pretty until then. the nose has trace oxidation and some green character, but its also still got some of that sexy fresh hop oily dankness, lemon marmalade, lime leaf, and green tea, a slight detergent thing happening to me, more as it warms, a little ripe melon juiciness, definitely more than just citra in play, its pretty dynamic. the flavor is good too still, clean ferment and on the dry side, earthy mixed malt type grain base, fluffy and airy feeling, soft and expansive, right on for both the flavors and textures of the fresh hops. good weed, green grape, papaya, green pinecone, and mandarin orange from the can, oily and sticky, clean though, just slightly vegetal, and still bright feeling to me, rushing carbonation, tiny bubbles but tons of them, some pep to it. overall i wish i had cracked this when i first got it, not sure what i was thinking there, but its still rad, is appreciable different from previous years, and fremont remains king of the hazy types, king of the fresh hops, and one of the best breweries in the west..."

Smell- Melon, clementine, dank, pine resin, peach, grassy, between medium and high strength of scent.

Taste- Clementine, peach, melon, pine resin, grassy, between medium and high strength of flavor.

Feel- Between thin and medium body, average carbonation, highly prickly, moderately bitter, moderately mouth watering finish, mildly mouth warming.

Poured into an imperial can glass, this was a murky orange-yellow color, almost taupe. Good sized off-white head, lots of lace.

Mellow, sweet and citrusy fruit-like hop aroma. Just a teensie bit of crackery malt scent as well.

Fruit forward, but not obnoxiously so. And there's different sorts of fruitiness going on, with a tremendous amount of balance. Mango, papaya, orange, a little bit of strawberry. There's a very light bitterness on the back end, but it's very subtle. Ends fairly soft.

Medium bodied, with a lightly creamy mouth feel.

This is a delight to drink. The balance is pretty much perfect, and there's no one aspect getting dominant enough to affect the sheer drinkability, which is off the charts."

I’m really picking up a vanilla custard vibe in combination with stone fruit from the raisins, a nice bit of cinnamon, and a welcome alcohol warming at the back of the palate from the barrel on the taste, which mirrors the nose. Delicious stuff. 

The mouthfeel is full and decadent, perfect for this beer. Much preferred by this old beer nerd to last year’s prop, I’m glad I have a second bottle to see how it develops."

Black/brown appearance. 

A rough pour yielded a nice, noisy dark tan head which quickly dissipated; minimal lacing remained. 

Banana runts candy, sweet rice, caramel syrup & faint cinnamon notes in the nose; this smelled artificial & very sweet. 

Medium thick, sticky mouthfeel. 

Cinnamon, banana, mild caramel syrup & mild booze heat flavors. Some wood notes emerged as this warmed. 

Sweet, cinnamon forward & syrup-y. ""Natural flavors"" strike again. Drinkable but not worth tracking down in my opinioin."
2536,krl2112,Proprietor's Bourbon County Brand Stout (2023),3.81,Started out good but has a weird taste finish. Hard to explain. It’s not sour but maybe medicinal in a way. Doesn’t taste anything like rice pudding as I love rice pudding. Pretty disappointing.
2537,OfficerVZdiver,27th Anniversary Lemon Shark Double IPA,4.65,"This beer came with this years 12 Days of IPA, and unironically this was the last one I drank from the batch, and it is probably the best tasting beer ive ever had from this company. The bitterness mixed with the slight lemon citrus is put in so well, it just makes me want more. I wish I could find 12 packs of this beer where I’m at cause I want more! Stone usually doesn’t disappoint and this one is almost perfect when it comes to double IPAs for me."
2538,JamarcusMarinovich,27th Anniversary Lemon Shark Double IPA,3.87,"Poured from bottle to pint glass, a golden amber with slight head. Nose is a bit brighter (tangy-er?) than standard Stone offerings and was expecting typical over-the-top Stone taste and feel. Was not disappointed with either of those, as they both were in-your-face hoppy Stone. The brewing with grape skins and hint of lemon gave that tangy-er bite on the back of the tongue that the nose predicted. Lingers on the back of tongue with lemony/hop bite but finishes well. Still hoppy, still the Stone profile, but like a couple off their past offerings brings something a bit different than straight up hop punch to the mouth. A real good, high AC sipper."
2539,mactrail,27th Anniversary Lemon Shark Double IPA,3.91,"Some haze on the amber brew and plenty of foam in the Scotch thistle glass. Quite fragrant with the peach and nectarine plus citrus peel. Hot and sharp, but sippable with all the fruity flavors and the right dose of sugar. Flavors of lemon bar cookies with a distinct acidity. Quite sweet, but just right for sipping. This is one of the better Stone IPAs of recent years, though it's over the top in the usual Stone fashion. From the 12 oz can purchased in the six pack at the supermarket."
2540,dbl_delta,27th Anniversary Lemon Shark Double IPA,4.09,"Can into pint glass. Pours a hazy honey gold color with a persistent bright white head. Good lacing.

Quite enjoyable."
2541,hman43,27th Anniversary Lemon Shark Double IPA,4.06,"Look: It pours hazy orange on the dark side with a white head. Head retention is very good. 

Smell: It has a white wine and grape aroma to start with some peach and lemon. Alcohol is noticeable in the nose. 

Taste: The peach is strong in the flavor with lemon and tropical notes. There are some grape notes and a bit of white wine. 

Feel: It has a medium full body with a touch of harshness in the finish. 

Overall, the flavors are truly amzing but the finish is a tad harsh."
2542,57md,27th Anniversary Lemon Shark Double IPA,4.16,Pours a hazy orange straw color with slightly more than a finger of head. The nose has complimentary notes of dankness blended with tropical fruits. The flavor profile is more malty and heartier than I expected. The yeast is very assertive especially as one moves down to the bottom of the glass. The bitterness on the finish is kept well in check.
2543,spectru,27th Anniversary Lemon Shark Double IPA,3.78,"1/5/2024 Light hazy with lots of flakes floating around, reminiscent of Voodoo Ranger Juicy Haze. White head recedes to cap, slightly lacy; Tastes is okay, but my taste buds have been battered by COVID. Mouthfeel is okay. Not a bad beer."
2544,donspublic,27th Anniversary Lemon Shark Double IPA,4.24,"Poured from bottle into tulip, good 3 finger cream colored head, good retention, epic lacing. Pale golden in the glass, hazy to look at, and a good smattering of yeast floaties. Bright on the nose, tropical notes of citrus, grapefruit, lemon pineapple and hints of a big malt bill. Taste follows the nose, drinks bright on the front end, all the citrus notes come thru tangerine, grapefruit, a good dose of sweet malt, then quickly goes somewhat dank with overripened pineapple and finishes with a good firm bitterness and leaves almost a lemon residual on the palate. Nice, the taste of this beer is all over the place in a good way, big time tropical, yes slams some old-school dankness in your face, yet leaves you will a shot of lemon lingering on your palate. Nice Job

Advent 2023-19"
2545,Darkmagus82,27th Anniversary Lemon Shark Double IPA,4.14,"Poured from a can into a pint glass 
Appearance – The beer pours a hazed yellow-orange color with a small head of white foam. The head fades quite quickly leaving a touch of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – The aroma is strong of a bitter grapefruit and grapefruit rind like smell, paired with some tropical fruits of pineapple and mango. Along with these smells comes some white grape juice like smells as well as notes of grape skin and must. A little bit of lemon and a touch of herb are there as well, rounding it all out.
Taste – The taste begins with bready malt backbone taste mixed with a big showing of grapefruit hop and a bit of herb and pine. There are other flavors of white grape and tangerine, along with some lemongrass and a touch of wheat and hay. As the taste advances the herb and pine get stronger at the expense of the grapefruit, becoming the dominant hop flavors toward the end of the taste transition. The flavors sour and bitter more as well, with the hop getting more bitter and the lemon increasing the sourness a touch. Toward the very end a little bit of a chalky like taste and a touch of mustiness comes to the tongue, leaving one with a nice bitter but balanced and oddly pleasant taste to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is medium to thinner in thickness and creaminess with a rather average carbonation level. For the mix of unique flavors and abv, the feel is pretty nice, keeping the beer approachable, but slowing you down a tad. 
Overall – A rather unique and rather fun brew. At first I didn’t care for it too much, but after sipping on it for a while it really grew on me. Rather fun."

A great juicy DIPA with a Mosaic-heavy Hop kick."
2547,Sdc3,27th Anniversary Lemon Shark Double IPA,4.65,"Nice pour, complex flavor profile. This is a damn good beer, in fact one of Stone’s finest!"
2548,Franziskaner,Czech Pilsner,3.82,"Gold color with excellent clarity and a fingernail of off white on top. Moderate, soapy lacing. The aroma is of grassy German hops and light malt. I’m tasting just a hint of grassy hops, light malt, and a just a bit of that well water/Czech Pilsner yeast. The mouth is refreshing and crisp."
2549,jlindros,Czech Pilsner,4.32,"No can date, thanks to Robert for this one
Pours a large foamy bubbly 3 finger head with moderate retention, tons of sticky lacing, mostly clear slight haze blonde to orange color

Nose brings grainy malt, cereal, straw, typical pilsner malt, some malt sweetness, not picking up any decoction notes, some herbal floral hops

Taste brings some hops up front, med bitterness kicks in with more herbal turning spicy hops, good base bready cereal malt base, more grainy-sweet pilsner malt, straw, a bit of dough, finishes dry and fairly crisp, a bit spicy herbal hop kick at the end lingering as well, like a good Czech pils

Mouth is med to a bit lighter bod, med to a bit lighter carb, soft lager

Overall nice, right down the middle of the style, good base malt although I would have liked a bit more malt presence, hop characters were on point and bitterness as well, nice finish, good lager, no decoction mash but that's OK"
2550,Tolianych_Pivomnabuhanych,Czech Pilsner,5,"This is not a Pilsner. This is a Czech style pale lager.

That said, this is a really well made beer. I liked everything about, including a very much Czech style elegantly bitter hop finish."
2551,MNJR,Czech Pilsner,5,"Can't say enough about how impressed I've been with UCBC. All of their beer has been excellent. This Czech pils is stellar in every way. Balance of lemon sweetness, soft pepper, subtle hop botanical spiciness, with an appealing dry finish that demands I take a another sip. Fantastic expression of all a pilsner should be. World class beer from St. Louis. Budweiser was probably good in its day, way back when. The brewers at UCBC are doing a great honor to the brewing legacy of their town and creating out of this world, fantastic beer. I've not been to the brewery, or even been to STL in 35 years, but this brewery makes me want to go. Outstanding."
2552,Gatch,Czech Pilsner,4.47,"Picked up a four-pack on the way out of the Bierhall. Could only take one home and it seems I decided on the right one. This is stellar stuff. Has that crisp, peppery malt body that makes the style great with a slightly sweet finish. Fills the mouth with malty goodness upon each sip. Hint of hops at the end rounds it out nicely. Would be happy to drink a beer like this in Europe, let alone St. Louis. Well done, UCBC!"
2553,steveh,Czech Pilsner,4.18,"""The Perfect Holiday Pils."" Didn't realize Pilsners were holiday beers now.

Anyway, canned 10-31-23 (maybe that was the holiday?), reviewed 12-09-23. Poured into a short, wide glass mug.

L -- Clear, deep gold with a dense white head that holds up well.

S -- DMS and herbal hops with a mild, yeasty doughiness.

T -- Herbal hops and a touch of citrus up front. Folds into a crackery graininess and a touch of that doughy yeast. Finish and aftertaste are bitter, herbal hops and a hint of sweet malt -- even a touch of mild diacetyl.

F -- Mouthfeel is slick to crisp and dry with a light-medium body.

O -- A very nice Bohemian Pils with the right balance of body and bitterness."
2554,GuyFawkes,Czech Pilsner,4.28,"Canned 10/31/23; drank 12/10/23 @ the Yarchives. 

See-through dull orange/yellow appearance. 

A rough pour yielded a HUGE white head (careful pouring!); strong, frothy tree-rung lacing remained. 

White bread, corn & mild pine notes in the nose. 

Creamy medium mouthfeel. 

White bread & fresh corn flavors up front; mild dry pine notes on the finish. 

Great mouthfeel and very tasty. I'd have another!"
2555,RaulMondesi,Czech Pilsner,3.77,"This is a big beer. Almost too big. And I’m not talking about a Lizzo ABV; it’s just massive on the palate. It hits hard like Jackson pollock, and has me thinking, “Is this really good?” For real, flavor just envelops your entire mouth almost too much. It’s like the kid at the birthday party who always blew up his balloon too big; eventually it popped and made Jr cry."
2556,zeff80,Czech Pilsner,3.71,"16oz can. Poured out a clear, straw-yellow color with a small, fluffy, white head of foam. It left sudsy trails of lace on the glass. It smelled of caramel, bread crust and floral notes. Sweet bready taste with caramel, toffee and citrus."
2557,MissouriMule,Czech Pilsner,4.6,"I was given this as a sample at the Columbia, MO Macadoodles. 

It pours a light straw with a towering, creamy head that sticks around for a respectable length of time. The beer may be a little paler in color than it ought to be, if you are stickler for appearance.

Smell is dominated by spicy, herbal, and bright floral notes. Malt is detectable, but faint. 

The taste profile reflects the nose. The malt plays the role it should, balancing the hops. The hops have a bit of sharp spice, but predominantly lend a moderate noble hops bitterness to the experience. The bitterness is consistent from first taste to the lingering aftertaste. Some may find it too bitter for the style, but I can find no fault in it. 

Feel and carbonation are impeccable, a common characteristic in UCBC beers.

This is one of the best pilsners I have had. One of the others is UCBC’s Stammtisch. These folks have a deep bench of great beers. Try this one if you can. I wish I had slowed down to wait for the beer manager to throw some on the shelf to buy; this is not available in my town."
2558,Suds,Czech Pilsner,4.49,"Just saw this one in the store. It is a winter release from UCBC, so I had to grab a few. It is a completely clear, crystal gold color. The light hop aroma and a bit of grain. The flavor is spicy-peppery and very clean & crisp. A little light bready malt notes in the foretaste. Wonderful"
2559,aleigator,Double Daisy Cutter - Mosaic,3.32,"Yields a clear, amber to orange color with a bigger, spongy heat atop.

Smells of flowery lime zest, peaches and ripe mango among a noteable, sweet malt richness, lingering tangerines and a whiff of honey.

This offers a light and refreshing mouthfeel, enhanced by the lively, slightly metallic carbonation in this.

Tastes of a malty, honey forward resin impression, together with lighter, dry lime and additional orange zest. Offers a true malt punch then, with honey and toffee defining the taste, while the hops are pulling back almost entirely. Finishes a little more balanced with returned, grassy hops, which also inherit a light passion fruit note.

This is just a little to sweet for my taste, with no real complexity to speak of. Its hops seem subdued, which is especially unfortunate, since the Mosaic hops usually are able to create an intriguing flavor depth, which is not the case in here."
2560,mothman,Double Daisy Cutter - Mosaic,4.1,"On tap. White head. Clear golden color.

Juicy, blueberries, papaya, honeydew. Hoppy with some dank, resin flavors. Nice bitterness. Ends sticky like a west coast. Solid offering."
2561,eppCOS,Double Daisy Cutter - Mosaic,4.35,"L - west coast clear, a nice version and surprise of a DDC that isn't yet another hazy. Good foam, decent lacing.
S - Woah, tropics meet blueberry thunder with shades of guava, mango, and some fresh floral pine. Really distinct. Good use of different Mosaic hop variants (and cryo).
T - This is where the beer shines; more bitter blueberry tropical waves, distinct from other DDC, and second only to the Nelson variant. I think I like it more than Galaxy (did I just say that?). 
F - Great, round, but drying mouthfeel on this. Satisfying. 
O - a great DDC, #2 in my book after Nelson, but head and shoulders above the others, I think."
2562,brentk56,Double Daisy Cutter - Mosaic,4.27,"Appearance: Arrives clear and copper colored with a two finger head that leaves clumps of lacing

Smell: Floral and juicy aromatics with a sweet malt presence; tones of papaya, mango, melon and candied citrus

Taste: The malts lay down a biscuity backbone with the papaya and mango emerging; melon adds some softness with the candied citrus arriving in the middle; slightly boozy in the finish

Mouthfeel: Medium body with moderate to high carebonation

Overall: A well-balanced, if slightly old-school DIPA"
2563,mfnmbvp,Double Daisy Cutter - Mosaic,4.46,"16 fl oz. can, canned 08/10/23, just over 4 weeks in the can works for me. Looks like this was brewed with two different types of Mosaic? Mosaic Lupomax and Mosaic T-90?

A: Nice and cold, the beer whistled a tune to me as a I poured it into the glass. Looks remarkably fresh & sudsy. Good burnt orange color body, strong finger of soapy white head, lots of spotty lacing. It looks damn excellent, I'll be real.
S: Bursting with fresh florals, juice, & nectar. This thing is hugely floral on another level. I can literally just shut my eyes and fade away into how fresh smelling this beer is. Like being in a field of flowers in the warm sun.
T: Mosaic is hands down probably my favorite hop ever. Such a beautiful clean flavor. Hugely fresh & floral, literally bursting with fresh juicy hop character at every small sip. Not overly bitter or piney, but there are definite elements of citrus, pine, resin, orange juice, papaya, etc..
F: Feel is extremely smooth, frothy, clean. Medium-bodied, with excellent carb. Fairly easy to drink stuff also for the slightly higher 7.50% abv. Not boozy or astringent at all. I'd probably call this dangerously drinkable.

Overall, a nice fresh incantation of Daisy Cutter, certainly interesting, and I'd be interesting in trying other hop varieties of this.

Half Acre Mosaic Double Daisy Cutter -----4.5/5"
2564,dano213,Double Daisy Cutter - Mosaic,4.25,"16oz can purchased from the fridge as a 4-pack for $17.49. Canned on 8/10/2023, so this is just over one month old.

Look: Nice clarity, perhaps a slight chill haze. It is a beautiful rich copper color. This could totally pass for a Festbier. There was a finger and half of off-white head that eventually dissipated to a thin layer. There is a steady stream of very tiny bubbles rising up the circumference of the glass.

Smell: Nice aromas of grapefruit, orange zest, peach gummy rings, mango, melon, papaya, and pineapple. It's also piney and there is a bit of dankness. Even though there are a lot of fruity notes, the nose is balanced and it's not leaning towards fruity or tropical. After swirling the glass, there is a bit of a vegetal note that is oniony. The nose also has a creaminess to it. Nice caramel malt note undertones.

Taste: Wow. This is really good. The taste basically follows the nose - it has all of those flavors coming through in a surprisingly balanced way and the flavors are also intensely delivered. The finish is moderately bitter with tons of orange zest and grapefruit pith on top of a tasty caramel malt backdrop. The finish is not sweet and also not super dry, but definitely leaning towards dry.

Feel: Very nice mouthfeel - it's medium plus bodied with a slightly viscous mouthfeel yet it's very drinkable. The beer has a lingering chewiness. It has very soft, smooth carbonation.

Overall: It's delicious. Of all of the Daisy Cutter versions that I have had (base Pale Ale, Double Daisy Cutter, and Double Daisy Cutter - Nelson), I think that this is by far my favorite. I also love going back to the regular Daisy Cutter Pale Ale, but this is more unique and complex, and obviously it's a bigger beer. I also like how of all the Double Daisy Cutter versions that I have had, this one is most true to the original. I also prefer a West Coast style Imperial IPA to a New England style one, and this beer is definitely West Coast style. As an aside, I love the colorful label design with the ""mosaic"" stained glass depiction of the daisies, which is very clever and appropriate for the Double Daisy Cutter - Mosaic double pale ale.

From instagram:
Mosaic DDC is built on a similar malt bill as Daisy Cutter, then goes all in on Mosaic hops hand selected in Yakima. This double pale ale leans to the West Coast as the heavy dry hop of Mosaic presents fresh peeled grapefruit & dank blueberry aromas with underlying resin & ripe Allium lingering. A clear, deep golden color lifts a dense billow of white foam. Full bodied with lush mouthfeel, our latest DDC flows with dewy, bright aromas & flavors.

2565,57md,Double Daisy Cutter - Mosaic,4.21,"Pours a light copper color with two big fingers of head. The nose has bright notes of oranges and lemons. The citrus carries over into the flavor profile, but it is not as bold as the nose would suggest. There is a residual sweetness that contrasts nicely with the bitterness of the hops on the finish."
2566,Lobina,Double Daisy Cutter - Mosaic,4.3,On draft at Arizona Beer House in Tucson during a wicked rain storm. Another great beer from Half Acre. They need to do more mosaics. Cheers to all BA’s
2567,Chuckdiesel24,Moment Of Mocha,4.3,"I really enjoy this and the mouthfeel is great - my knock is the flavors seem to cover the barrel too much, which hasn’t been the case for their other 100% BA beers"
2568,BEERchitect,Moment Of Mocha,4.49,"You just can't keep doing the same things over and over without eventually wanting a break. Although a brewery may be known for their fruitier and hazier IPA, eventually the itch to do something different has got to strike. ...if only for a moment.

Pouring an unctuous shade of viscous blackness, Tree House's Moment of Mocha departs from the usual stout with its luscious and creamy pour. Much like a beery milkshake, the sweet stout patiently releases a trickle of espresso froth while leading with a bold roasted coffee scent laced with chocolate, char and cream. Both roasty and sweet on the early palate, a sense of molasses and milk chocolate frame the underlying malty sweetness.

As the dark ale seeps deeply into the tastebuds, its roasty sweetness begins to favor the coffee with a more robust espresso roast character. The chocolate develops a pleasant bittersweetness as the cocoa is brought out beautifully by the coffee and sweet roasted of barley sugars. Soothed by the effects of vanilla, a taste of heavy cream and and bourbon meld together with a caramel, coconut and sweet toasted oak finish.

Full bodied although being softened by the creaminess of chocolate, the stout finishes both creamy and roasty with a long linger of slightly burnt brownies and roasted marshmallow that are then spiked with kahlua. Its a dessert session that is best shared with beer drinkers with a serious sweet tooth."
2569,GreesyFizeek,Moment Of Mocha,4.51,"This one pours a very dark black color, with a small head, and just a touch of lacing.

This smells so chocolatey and rich, with one of the boldest coffee aromas I’ve ever gotten out of a beer.

There’s a ton of rich baker’s chocolate and fudge brownie here, with a dynamite and bold coffee note here – chocolate, caramel, and that just sort of inexplicable and delicious jolt that allows you to reform into a real person in the early morning. There’s also bourbon, caramel, and sticky molasses.

This is thick, but not boozy, with a nice creamy and chocolatey finish.

This is one of the best Tree House stouts that I’ve had yet. I love their coffee and it just integrates so well with their stouts."
2570,Roguer,Moment Of Mocha,4.15,"Intense and, frankly, intimidating nose. Waves upon waves of rich coffee, amplified by cacao and bourbon. Additional notes of cream, oak, caramel, molasses. Beyond rich and decadent.

This richness certainly translates to a massive fullness on the palate, but more so in the mouthfeel than in the flavor itself. There's a distinct sharpness, if not outright sourness, likely from the coffee. This definitely reduces my enjoyment somewhat, although it's still a rich and powerful beer. The bourbon doesn't come through quite as well as I'd like; in fact, a decadent bourbon sweetness would suit this beer very well, but it's just not quite there. Additional tasting notes of toast, very light char, chocolate, molasses, caramel, coffee, prune, red grape, red wine."

Light amounts of lacing are observed.

S: Moderate to strong aromas of juicy stone fruit/peach + tropical/mango + citrus/grapefruit + tropical/passionfruit hops along with a light aromas of herbal/mint hops over the top of light to moderate aromas of biscuit + wheat + oat malts with a light to moderate amount of sugary sweetness.

T: Upfront there are light to moderate flavors of biscuit + wheat + oat malts with a light to moderate amount of sugary sweetness. That is followed by moderate to strong flavors of juicy stone fruit/peach + tropical/mango + citrus/grapefruit + tropical/passionfruit hops along with a light flavors of herbal/mint hops which impart a light amount of bitterness which fades away leaving moderate lingering stone fruit + tropical hop flavors.

2583,MonDak_Joe1953,Come Original IPA,4.21,"16oz can. Date stamp on bottom lip of can is '05/12/23 LOVE YOUR LIFE'. From the WCIPA Box.
Clear, pale gold colored body. Two fingers of white head, slowly retreats to an interrupted cap. Leaves behind webs of lacing.
Aroma is fragrant, with mango, orange, pine, and a little berry (strawberry).
Taste starts fruity sweet with mango and orange, and there is an additional sweet side late that is more candy-like. From mid point on the pine resin is present. Moderate bitterness extends into the aftertaste once the sweetness wears off.
Medium mouth feel. Some tongue sting comes with each sip but does not last. Clean and dry finish. Very good carbonation.
Good balance between the sweet and the bitter, and the late candy sweetness is something different when compared to other beers in the WCIPA Box. Once the bitterness kicks in it is long lasting, but pleasant and not a palate destroyer."
2584,NickSMpls,Come Original IPA,4.17,"Clear pour, skim coat of a head. Enjoyable aroma. Taste is right on. Dry finish, clean and hoppy. The 7% ABV goes well. If we had ready access to this beer, it would be a good candidate for a regular."

Tree House Brewing Compa... IPA-Imperial / Double New....

Softest hop liquid around, creamy and grainy feel with a mega high complexity of hops. The hop combo is very unique from, Hallertau Blanc to Nelson, this vast array of hop tones are sweet and tangy. Fruity hop juice and creamy feel and finish is a beauty. 8.8% abv is cranking but you'd almost never know it by the flavor or feel.

O: Very heavy & sweet. Fairly boozy. Beautiful looking, great aroma and has a lovely taste. The feel morphs over time. This is a long drinking alcohol-forward sipper that is not for the meek. It is outstanding in its style."

Taste: It has strong caramel and plum favors with touches of raisins and sherry. There are bourbon notes with hints of wood.

Compared to Hop Butcher Treez Freez 1/2024: Pours identical. Stronger aromas. More apricot and ripe berries. Less sweet grape, citrus, and pine. Sweeter and heavier. Winner: Treez Freez

Compared to Treez Freez 1/2024: Pours identical. Stronger aromas. More sweet berry, melon, and apricot. Less resinous orange, tangerine, and sweet pine. 

Overall: Peacharine and Simcoe so you know it's going to be tropical, creamy, and smooth. A bit milder on the aroma and flavor. Had to let it warm a bit for the flavors to evolve. Complex flavors, but a bit faded. Incredibly creamy and smooth. Have a feeling it might get better over the next few weeks as the flavors emerge a bit. (Current Rating: 4.04)"
2601,drdiesel9483,Ceylon Swirl,4.35,"Look - black and fairly thick with nice rimming
Smell and taste - nice balance between chocolate cinnamon and barrel, not overelly sweet
Feel - nice and thick with a slight creamy and light carb
Ovearll - pretty great well balanced"
2602,DokiDokiLitFam,Ceylon Swirl,4.41,"Notes of slight barrel aging on the nose. Cinnamon, molasses, vanilla, chocolate, mild coffee. This has notes of a molasses snap with some vanilla frosting. Maybe perhaps like a chocolate bundt cake with a cup of coffee. Very nice. Rich, decadent. Full bodied mouthfeel. Silky smooth and a touch cloying. Even with 12 oz this is a slow sipper. But very enjoyable. Tree House is really stepping it up with these barrel aged experession. More in line with their legendary Big Nugget."
2603,Roguer,Ceylon Swirl,4.27,"Very little head to speak of; otherwise, an attractive beer.

Very potent nose. The bourbon influence is prominent, including a strong oaky note. I don't get much else from the nose, save perhaps some vanilla and the molasses-toffee-brown sugar from the malt base. It smells quite nice, but the complexity I expected is a bit buried beneath the waves of bourbon.

Very thick and creamy mouthfeel. Fair amount of bite, but it's not harshness from the booze. It drinks very smoothly.

Flavor delivers in waves that the nose can't quite muster - although I'm still not getting much of a specific pastry impression. Notes of bourbon (leaning sweet), chocolate, vanilla (especially on the finish), coffee, molasses, toffee, red grape. This is really damn good, and with subsequent sips, I do get more of a pastry-like impression. It's not overly sweet, somewhere between breakfast and dessert stout, leaning more toward the latter perhaps, but never cloying. Cinnamon is noticeable, but never dominates, thankfully."
2604,tigg924,Ceylon Swirl,3.45,"Pours opaque, dark brown in color with minimal head. Taste is big cinnamon that is sometimes hot, barrel and vanilla with a touch of Toblerone. Heavy body, super low carbonation, slightly sweet...slightly barrel aged cinnamon stout in standard Tree House form....fine paying $5 for this but not the current price...Other breweries do this better."
2605,drdiesel9483,Oude La Ruche - Kriek,4.53,"Look - Love the thick haze pinkish with fantastic rimming
Smell and taste - tart funky cherry, nut not overly tart or sweet. Great balance!

OVerall - Just Fantastic!"
2606,Harrison8,Oude La Ruche - Kriek,4.46,"Pours pink with a mild fog to the translucency. Aroma is acidic, and mildy tart, blending dark cherries with oak and stone. Flavor profile carries the same acidic undertones with flavor provided by soft and dark cherries, oak, and stone. Splendid, mild mix. Semi-dry finish. Mouth feel is medium in thickness with a soft effervescence. Overall, punchy cherries in a tart package. Wonderfully sippable. 

Bottle pour at brewery. Reviewed from notes. 10yr anniversary version."
2607,GreesyFizeek,Oude La Ruche - Kriek,3.82,"This one pours a clear golden reddish color, with a small head, and a little bit of lacing.

This smells like very tart lemon, acidic cherry, berry funkiness, and a some citrusy funk.

This has some nice cherry flavors, but it’s also extremely tart – too much so. There not enough else going on to balance against the high acidity. Side Project is definitely know to have a much more tart profile, but this feels a bit higher than usual.

This is light bodied, and pretty puckering. It’s a slow sipper for sure.

I definitely liked the regular Oude La Ruche more than this – the cherry seems to make this a bit too tart in the end."
2608,Luscious_Malfoy,Oude La Ruche - Kriek,4.54,"poured from a white-waxed 375mL bottle into SP LC stemmed glassware. pours a light red with a little over a finger of off-white foam head. white wine, damp oak, sweet cherries all on the nose and in the taste. in the taste the cherries present themselves as a little less sweet and a little tart. the acidity that has typically been kept in check with OLR is a little higher due to the cherries i suspect. thick, full mouthfeel. smooth and a little less carb than most of their saisons (although in line with the oude series of saisons). really good but i prefer it without the cherry addition."
2609,malrubius,Schatzi,4.9,Can. Dark amber with lasting dense eggshell head. Smokey woody aroma with a pleasant touch of old leather and herby mint. Medium sweet brown sugar maple syrup with roasty grain with medium spicy herbal finish to dry it up. medium light body smooth silky low carbo. Totally fucking excellent. Tastes straight from Bamberg.

The appearance is amber brown with red hues under a modest beige head.

I pick up smoky malts in the aroma as promised and a lower profile earthy hop sensation.

Light-medium mouthfeel.

The taste is sweet, malt forward, and smoked with a mild earthy hop finish. Enjoyed it."
2612,flagmantho,Crucial Taunt⁴,4.16,"Poured from 16oz can into a dimpled mug. Canned on 7/20/23.

Appearance: thickly hazy orange-yellow hue with a finger of frothy ivory foam atop that has a hint of orange to it.

Smell: sweet and citrusy with an orange rind quality that is nevertheless not harsh; it's the classic Orange Julius aroma and I like it.

Taste: sweet, citrusy, a bit dank, and very nicely juicy. There's a hint of an edge to the finish; not really bitter, but almost tart. It's interesting -- but I dig it.

Mouthfeel: medium body with a good level of carbonation and creaminess to the style.

Overall: although I quite like it, there is a little bit of a rough-around-the-edges quality to the flavor. Still, definitely a beer worth having."
2613,SawDog505,Crucial Taunt⁴,4.54,"Poured into a 13 oz teku glass canned 5/01/23. Pours a very attractive dark hazy yellow with a 2 finger sticky white head that leaves plenty of thin streaks of lace, with excellent retention. 4.75

2614,MikeWard,Excursions: Manilita / Phantasm,4.42,"On tap at Sabatinis in Exeter pa late this afternoon.

Very nice looking beer, hazy yellowish body, big bright white head, layers of lacing. Strong hoppy aroma, a faint herbal note. Taste confirms the nose, no fruit notes, not overwhelming, but a lovely herbal bitterness. Slightly drying finish, great beer, had to have another."

2616,BFCarr,Excursions: Manilita / Phantasm,4.21,"Canned on 9/18, enjoyed on 10/8
Pours hazy yellow/amber with a think white head. Aroma is hop forward with some citrus notes. Taste is also hop forward with a little citrus late on and an interesting bite in the middle.

Dew, lychee, and orange in the middle. Bark and melon rind towards the end. Fantastic balance. Body is light with moderate to ample carbonation. Bone dry on the palate and aggressive going down. Dry, almost puckering finish. 

Really balanced flavor. Fantastic body."
2619,GreesyFizeek,Excursions: Manilita / Phantasm,4.28,"This one pours a glowing hazy orange, with a fluffy white head, and lots of lacing.

This smells like grapefruit, papaya, pineapple, passionfruit, Sauvignon blanc grapes and weed.

This is obviously quite the innovative “hop” combination. There’s a lot of passionfruit and white grape thing going on here, with a Nelson/Riwaka sort of vibe, I guess. There’s papaya or kiwi or something like that, lots of grapefruit, pineapple, mango, and a weedy and pleasantly soft bitterness.

This is light bodied and pretty soft, with a fantastic drinkability.

It’s hard not to like this one."
2620,mothman,Excursions: Manilita / Phantasm,4,"On tap at HF. Hazy golden sunset. White head with lace.

New Zealand hop profile. Bright and fruity. Melon, honeydew, and light stone fruit. Mango. Very earthy and a bit floral. Hop powder. Bitterness in the finish. 

Solid ipa, but a bit new school styled with the hop powder."
2621,GuyFawkes,Benthic - Chocolate Hazelnut,3.42,"Canned 10/16/23; drank 11/26/23 @ the Yarchives. 

Black appearance. 

A violent pour yielded a huge, noisy dark tan head; strong, frothy tree-rung lacing remained. 

Orange candy (like your Grandma gives out?), marshmallow, faint hazelnut & chocolate syrup notes in the nose. 

Thick mouthfeel. 

Marshmallow, hazelnut, chocolate syrup & bourbon heat flavors. 

Odd tasting, with orange candy notes and odd syrup vibes. I'd assume they are using real ingredients based on my respect for Half Acre, but this tastes like a candy monstrosity. Not one I'll return to."
2622,IMFletcher,Benthic - Chocolate Hazelnut,4.44,"Can pour; brown head that dissipates to a thin ring around the edges. Initial nose was pastry, settles into more barrel with time.

2623,Luscious_Malfoy,Benthic - Chocolate Hazelnut,4.21,"poured from a 12oz can into a TG DBA tumbler. pours dark brown with almost two fingers of dark brown foam head. these beers aren’t thin but the benthic series definitely pours a thinner, more see-through brown than the catch bell series or even before land shook. chocolate, bourbon, oak and hazelnut but the hazelnuts are quite mellow and balanced but still definitely there. love the nose but the taste gives off slightly bitter, nutty chocolate with a kind of chalky dry finish. medium-full mouthfeel. i kind of expected to like this one a little more and while it’s not bad there’s something about it that’s just a little off to me. it’s not offensive but it’s also as advertised: lot of chocolate and hazelnut."
2624,darktronica,Benthic - Chocolate Hazelnut,4.16,"Compared to the base Benthic, this is overrun by hazelnut, which would be excellent for ferrero rochet fans but is much less complex than other variants have been in the past. Still excellent, but I lose sight of the coconut and coffee amidst the chocolate and hazelnut, as if it were another beer entirely. Very little barrel character or booziness, as it has been overcome by sweetness."
2625,4DAloveofSTOUT,Benthic - Chocolate Hazelnut,4.69,"12oz can poured into Benthic branded Rastal Lawerance Stemless glass.

canned on date: 10/16/23.

Appearance: Black bodied stout with thick dark brown head with good staying power and head structure. Boozy legs present. Lacing also clings to the glass as the beer disappears.

Smell: Nice hazelnut note. Lots of coconut and chocolate and bourbon as well.

Taste: Big notes of Hazelnuts that even taste creamy. Milk chocolate and big coconut notes. Nice barrel notes that add some dark cherry and leather to the already decadent stout. Light barrel char. Wow it's really good. 

Mouthfeel: Thick bodied stout with low and adequate carbonation levels. Not a hint of booze. Again Wow. 

Overall: This was nearly perfect. It's an absolutely delicious stout. Now that Half Acre has gone the Hazelnut route with Benthic, I would love to see a Macadamia nut variant of Benthic!"
2626,beergoot,Something Stickee,4.21,"Pours a clear, medium brown tone, opaque in the glass; thin, khaki hued head that soon dissipates to a thin ring inside the glass with a few patches of foam floating in the middle of the ring. Big, rich aroma; an alluring blend of chocolate and cocoa with dried, dark pitted fruits; licorice. Sweet and somewhat earthy spice flavor; brown sugar and allspice; anise; raisins and orange; chewing tobacco; fine, boozy undercurrent, whiskey. Heavy body with a light sugary stickiness; subliminal alcohol warmth.

This is quite the tasty barrel aged quadruple. The rye whiskey and orange bitters barrel aging certainly gives this beer a nice zingy extra something to the malt base.

Pouring temperature: 50 °F; bottling info: 2023 Vintage №.01; BEER BEFORE GLORY

2627,stortore,Something Stickee,4.37,"12 ounce bottle into a goblet. A 2023 release, had 9/7/23.

Pours a dark ruby color, semi opaque, with a quarter inch foamy head and some foamy lacing. Aromas of caramel, orange bitters, rye whiskey, chocolate, some oak. Has a somewhat spicy aroma. Flavors of rye whiskey, chocolate, caramel, orange bitters, malt, light oak. Has a spicy taste and a light sweet note- Candi sugar? Smooth a very good medium body, appropriately carbonated. 

Really enjoyable. The Rye barrels are terrific, the cocoa nibs stand out and the bitters have a solid presence. The base isn’t quite like the original, but it’s still above average. Well worth a purchase."
2628,Rug,Something Stickee,4.24,"2023 vintage

I haven’t had the OG Stickee Monkee yet, though I’ve wanted to for quite a while. I just never see it around me. When I saw this variant on Tavour I figured I might as well go for it, it actually sounds really interesting. I’m not sure I’ve ever seen a beer using orange bitters before this one. Let’s dive in

Pours a very dark brown with a finger of light tan head that fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing

The nose honestly screams more of a sweeter Barleywine than a Quad, but I dig it. I’m picking up on aromas of milk chocolate, orange bitters, sweet whiskey, caramel, toasted oak, raisin, cacao nib, molasses, and light vanilla

It’s sweeter in taste and feels even less like a Quad, though it’s still enjoyable. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting molasses, sweet whiskey, milk chocolate, sweet vanilla, burnt sugar, caramel, toasted oak, light raisin, and orange bitters. The swallow brings notes of molasses, toasted walnut, sweet whiskey, toasted oak, apple skin, caramel, orange bitters, cacao nib, and raisin

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a smooth beer. Finishes mostly dry with a slight boozy punch

This one is super unique. It doesn’t carry too much of the Quad identity, but I’m enjoying it regardless"
2629,cjgiant,Something Stickee,4.1,"On the sweet side, but pretty in line with the base beer. The additions come through a little nicer in the taste than the nose, but is well integrated in both cases. The nibs push the quad just a little bit towards the stout realm."
2630,pants678,Something Stickee,3.48,"Dark red, brown body.

Malty, bready.

Lightly chocolate, some Belgian-ish dark fruit taste but really overshadowed by the aggressive orange bitters. Not boring but not what I want in a quad.

Dry."
2631,Herbabee,Something Stickee,4.5,"Trying this one out for a quick study, and how it might compare to the OG. Flat cap pop pours into the sampler snifter without much caution, modest soapy head forms and quickly falls away - not even much gurgling around the rim as it sits and acclimates. Nearly opaque deep plum hue. Nose detects that influence of oranges, reminiscent of the cocktail blends that even F-W themselves had tried their hand at. Taste corroborates those orange-y olfactory impressions and in a big way, becomes a dominant presence in every savory sip (as we confusedly gauge its merit), quite sticky-sweet but tempered with a lingering bitter finish, swallow a little tart on the tongue and washed down in a bittersweet mélange and some barrel spirits to warm the belly.

Respectable effort, sure. And by no means repulsive. But i may be more partial to the base quad... whenever and if-ever they decide to brew, barrel & bottle it again...?"
2632,sjrider,Something Stickee,4.48,Bottle pour - opaque blackish brown with foamy khaki head leaving frosty lacing. Nose is sweet and grainy with hints of caramel and brown sugar.

Bole body, bone cap. Creamy, soapy, dense and fairly lasting head. Faint sheen of tears chasing the fine sandy lacing.

Malty, estery nose with brown sugar, bubble-gum, banana and raisin bread. Gentle and inviting.

Sweet palate entry with brown bread, chocolate pudding, leaf litter, currants, fig, treacle, alternating. Low but enlivening earthy bitterness throughout. Fairly dry, almost-abrupt finish. Distinctive Unibroue yeast flavors.

A little thin/fizzy perhaps, not quite medium bodied. Moderately warming.

A good example of the style, though lacking the character, complexity, and synergy of the best Belgian versions."

Malty and fairly spicy on the palate with undertones of chocolate-drizzled sugar cookies, cloves, rum-soaked raisins. Finishes with a lingering complexity."
2639,Saluki,Trader Joe’s 2023 Vintage Spiced Ale,4.66,I'll compare this to previous years kept in the cellar later but the first pour of this is delicious.

So far, as of 11/28/23, it's been difficult to locate. We found 2 bottles before Thanksgiving, but since then seems to be unobtainium at local TJ's.
The pour was @ 48F into a tulip, nice medium dark color (but it was outside by campfire so lighting was variable), not too active but lacy head. Smell was more caramel/clove. 
Normally if there's too much ginger in a spiced ale, I can taste as soapy residual. Happy to say the ginger (in whatever content) did not attack my palate and this beer drank very well. No ""pumpkin spice"" nonsense, just a strong, dark, ale with balanced spice. I think this is one of the better releases of this beer for me for a long time."

2644,Roguer,Brewmosa,4.53,"As expected, this is an insanely juicy beer, amplified even more by Tree House's house yeast strain. Despite targeting the flavor profile of a mimosa, the tropical fruit notes from the mango, hops, and yeast expression are far more dominant than the relatively mild citrus. This may be a slight miss in execution of intent, but in terms of overall flavor, it's absolutely delicious.

One of the best Tree House IPAs I've had, and absolutely crushingly smooth at 9% ABV."
2645,Newbeergeek1,Brewmosa,4.31,Came as part of a case that I wanted to try. Surprised at how light and easy to drink. Lots of flavors I like rolled up ito one beer. Well done TH. I hope the next time I am in the area that they will have this again. Likely doubtful but I can hope.
2646,agreenman19,Brewmosa,4.43,"L - hazy and thiqq. Dull, milky orange so thick it's gotta be mixed with something. Oh right, lactose. Head for dayz. Floofy and tall. Great retention and lacing with a creamy consistency. 

S - pithy orange, lemon meringue, and and oaty sweetness. Fruit punch. Tangerine citrus complements the guava stickiness nicely.

T - mango mixed with satsuma and gentle, dry bitterness. Melon creaminess and even some green grapes. Fruit salad with a sweet, but rindy zest. Tangy bite on the finish with a bit of heat to remind you that maybe bottomless Brewmosas is a bad idea. 

F - drinks as softly as it looks. Thicc and full-figured, this is a hearty breakfast in itself.

O - a hefty lad for sure. Not quite as crisp and refreshing as a mimosa, but it does nail the orange juice effect. Could've been better at lower ABV without the lactose, but I'm reviewing this one on its own merit, not what it claims to be."

Appearance: Dark brown and opaque, like a stout/porter.

Smell: Pleasant, with a spicy pumpkin as well as chocolate aromas. Some caramel and cinnamon aroma to a lesser extent.

Taste: Very nice and a unique taste. I can definitely taste the pumpkin, and there are some sweet flavors like maple syrup or chocolate brownie, which makes for a unique taste. Some coffee and roasted malt flavors. I like this better than most other pumpkin ales I have tried.

Feel: This is thicker than other pumpkin ales, with a similar feel to Founder's KBS series. Strong alcohol that matches the 8.6% listed on the label, but not overwhelming.

This is an interesting seasonal beer by Tree House. This is my favorite pumpkin ale along with Weyerbacher's Imperial Pumpkin. This is sweeter, while Weyerbacher has more spice in the flavor. Another great offering from Tree House. I will buy this again."

I ended up picking up just a few beers on today’s trip to Tree House, and this really caught my eye. It’s quite the lineup of fruit to add into an IPA, including ones you don’t typically see in the style. Let’s crack it open and see what it has to offer

Pours a hazy orange gold with 3 fingers of creamy off white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing

It’s definitely super fruity in the nose, but there’s a nice hoppy presence to it as well. I’m picking up on aromas of juicy strawberry, fleshy peach, grassy hops, bready malt, orange zest, underripe banana, passion fruit, and light white pepper

The fruit isn’t as forward in taste, but it’s just as good. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting fleshy peach, bready malt, mango skin, grassy hops, white pepper, light white grape, and weed. The swallow brings notes of juicy strawberry, underripe mango, bready malt, earthy hops, white pepper, passion fruit, light weed, and orange zest

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in smooth beer. Finishes neutral with a gentle bitterness

2657,REVZEB,Archaeometry,4.24,"The darkest brown opaque body with a fat finger of beige foam, slow loss of height. Smell has coconut, brandy barrel, brown sugar and barley with a hint of toast and vanilla. Taste starts with brandy, barley, brown sugar, and barrel, finishes with french toast and caramel. Feel is warm and smooth with a heavier body, barrel is evident in a good way."
2658,DIM,Archaeometry,4.22,"The brandy barrels take center stage here, deeply vinous, gently boozy, with a mellow oak tingle. I also get brown sugar, fruitcake, and as it warms, sweet coconut and a hint of Belgian chocolate. This all comes together well, not sure about the coconut though. I am absolutely enjoying this, but it's not quite up there with the best from Bottle Logic. Thanks Tim!"
2659,lucius10,Archaeometry,4.31,"Sweet toffee and brown sugar malty, hint of all-spice and dark fruit, and subdued coconut and brandy barrel nose on this one! Taste follows with a caramel malty, some dark fruity raisins, and a sweet brandy barrel swallow. The coconut is almost hidden while cold...and it starts to get dominated by the brandy barrel backend as it warms. This is pretty good, but as I am still learning/figuring out my palate, I think I prefer bourbon barrels versus apple brandy/brandy barrels with my barleywines and stouts."
2660,Beersnake,Archaeometry,4.35,"Poured at fridge temp into a brandy snifter. Pours dark brown with a very thin layer of light brown head. The nose is incredible. Screaming toffee, brandy, coconut, brown sugar, oak, plums, figs, and raisins. Wow. Intense.

The taste freaking incredible. Huge notes of brandy explode in the mouth on the first sip. Brandy barrels and barleywine go so nicely together. Rich toffee, brown sugar, cinnamon, graham crackers, coconut, vanilla, maple, grapes, and figs. A hint of oak comes through as well. 

The mouthfeel is medium to thick bodied, with a nice brown sugar and toffee aftertaste. Lovely barleywine."

Poured into a Trillium glass a pretty nice cloudy pale yellow color, pretty nice carbonation, with a pretty nice thick/creamy one-finger off-white head, which also leaves some pretty nice sticky lacing behind.

2664,ScruffySouthpaw,Adjunct Assault II Cinnamon Hazelnut Coffee,4.45,"Served in a snifter from the can. 

Appearance: deep dark almost black body with dark tan head which initially Rose just about a nudge over half a finger's length over the body. 

Smell: deep smell of straight up espresso, chocolate and more hints of almond and a light touch of vanilla. 

Taste: comes off sweet complex, with hints of Nutella spread accompanied with espresso. 

Mouth: sticky beer which reminds me of a cold brew coffee, the brew has a soft carbonation and a complete palette cleansing concoction. 

Overall: probably the winner for tonight, does not need any tweaking.. feels like I'm drinking a coffee infused devil's food cake and a glass. Not much more to ask for, just enjoy you every sip...salud!"

Might be the best beer I've had from Westbrook. Bought on a whim while picking up some things for a Secret Santa box and I'm sure glad I did... this is delicious stuff...

Hazelnuts and cinnamon are dominant here and yet this is in no way too sweet.. I think this is better than Mexican Cake....

No trace of the booze....zip... tough to do at 13% but they pulled it off here....very well done..

T- sweet dark chocolate and roasted charred malt up front are quickly followed by a hit of spicy cinnamon. Mid-palate brings out bold nutty hazelnut, as well as anise and a hint of caramel sweetness.

Pours an opaque yellowish orange with about two and a half fingers of white head. Thick looking. Great retention and lacing. A nice heap of head in the middle and a ring around the edges. Just a flat out beautiful looking beer.

And a great nose too. Dankness arrives on the crack of the can. Some grass, marijuana and onions with pineapple in the background. A little juicier on warming with a little bit of citrus sneaking in, but still predominantly dank.

Wish the taste followed. Kind of muddled juice with some dirt. Hints or apricot on warming. Still tastes great but far from the nose.

Mostly soft, full-bodied mouthfeel. Dry finish with a hint of stickiness. Low to medium carbonation. Very light bitter aftertaste.

This is really good, although bit of a drop off between the aroma and taste"

2672,Sheppard,Magic Of Garston,3.92,"Pours a milky yellowy orange or orangey yellow. Good retention. Lots to take in on the nose. There's guava, passionfruit, payaya, some orange zest, some pepper. Flavor is similar. More zesty than expected, the dank zest and black pepper character are pretty prominent. There's a little bit of guava in there which kinda provides a creamy feel. That dank textured pepperiness comes through on the finish and lingers. It's a little abrasive in that way. I wish more of that tropical fruit character came out, but it's really that spicy zest that's the key player here."
2673,vickersspitfire,Animals in the machine,4.29,"Pours out a nice bright golden hazy color topped off with a thick but not dense head that has good retention and great lacing. 
Citrus fruits mixed in with some tropical fruits smells along with lemon grass, very well balanced.

Poured into a tulip glass. Hazy light yellow color with decent initial white head and good curtain lacing. Pleasant tropical fruit smell. The taste follows this but is a bit dry for my taste.

A&S: Really good looking on the initial pour. Tan head that pours a finger and maintains in a ring. Very dark brown beer. The smell contains bourbon-heavy elements, dark cocoa, blackstrap molasses, and slight hints of vanilla.

T&M: The ABV is well hidden. The beer's barrel character is really good. Very similar to the smell. Not complex, but good. Not much evolution overwarming. The carbonation is surprisingly high for a BB-aged beer, but even so, it is a little too much carbonation for me.

Overall: Nothing crazy, but really solid. Great deal for the price. I would buy this again"

This is the final beer of all of the BIF boxes woemad kindly sent to me. He warned that this one might need a bit of age to round out, but I was just feeling this tonight so I went for it. Plus I trust Fremont to properly execute a Strong Ale, so I’m sure it’ll be fine. Let’s crack it open and see what it has to offer

Pours a very dark brown with 3 fingers of frothy tan head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing

It's definitely a bit jagged in the nose, but nothing that immediately turns me off. I'm picking up on aromas of spicy bourbon, earthy hops, cacao nib, sharp oak, acidic coffee, burnt caramel, light molasses, black cherry, and nutmeg

It feels a bit more put together in taste, but it's surprisingly thin. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting milk chocolate, earthy bourbon, toasted oak, black cherry, molasses, burnt caramel, charred coffee, and light cola. The swallow brings notes of earthy bourbon, nutmeg, molasses, black cherry, toasted oak, acidic coffee, molasses, brown sugar, and a touch of fusel alcohol

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a smooth beer. Finishes mostly dry with a slight boozy heat but is quite drinkable

This is certainly an interesting beer. I agree that some time could've helped it, but I could also see it going south over time given the thin structure of it"
2678,UWDAWG,Mezclar Barrel-Aged Cuvee,4.33,"Poured from a 16 ounce can dated 3-8-23 into a snifter.

Look- Black, opaque, medium brown frothy head, above average head retention and lacing.

Smell- Bourbon, chocolate, molasses, plum, oak, cinnamon, cherry, between medium and high strength of scent.

Taste- Toasted barley, oak, molasses, bourbon, cinnamon, plum, cherry, medium strength of flavor.

Feel- Between medium and full body, slightly below average carbonation, moderately bitter, between moderate and high creaminess, moderately mouth warming.

Overall- Look was superb with deep black color and above average head retention and lacing. Bouquet was a pleasant mix of bourbon, chocolate, molasses, plum, oak and cherry. Flavor was good, but dominated too much by roasted/charred barley. Feel was a nice mix of mouth warming, bitter and creaminess with a substantial, but not quite full body. Overall this was an enjoyable beer, but more bourbon character and less roasted barley would have made a big difference for me."
2679,beergoot,Mezclar Barrel-Aged Cuvee,4.22,"Dark brown pour, clear yet opaque in the glass look; thick, tan head, dense and semi-creamy. Dark grain and mild wood char on the nose; cacao nibs; raisins. Balanced and sweet taste; mild and sweet chocolate; cocoa powder; light to medium sense of bitterness; bourbon-like undercurrent, low-key at first and builds in intensity at the finish; coconut sweetness. Heavy mouthfeel yet airy; light sponginess; sticky residual sugar feel; very light boozy dryness to offset the sweetness aspect.

This delightful barrel aged dark beer blend has a lot going for it. It's very sublime and easy drinking, especially for being a 10.1% ABV beer. The mouthfeel is the true surprise and a delightful one. A big beer with a soft heart.

2682,woemad,Mezclar Barrel-Aged Cuvee,3.99,"16oz can purchased at Community Pint, in Spokane, for around $10. Canned on March 8, 2023 per the stamp on the bottom of the can.

Poured into a 16oz Fremont snifter, this was the color of night in the forest, with a relatively thin, mocha colored head. Said head dropped fairly quickly, but didn't die away entirely, leaving a thin ring at the top of the glass.

Bourbon-y, boozy nose, along with some dark, roasted malty notes and a little bit of chocolatey sweetness. The bourbon is way up front, though.

The taste is a little bit more complex than the nose, although not terribly. Bourbon-y and chocolatey up front, with a lingering, roasty dryness in the finish. There's a decent amount of warming alcohol in the background, but not as much as you might expect. Otherwise, it's sufficiently easy drinking to where you might forget what you're dealing with, in terms of ABV percentage.

Medium bodied, with a nice, creamy, velvety smooth mouth feel. Mouth feel really is pretty much the best thing about this beer.

This was quite good, but never quite reached the level of great for me. I might buy another can and deliberately set it aside for a year or two and see what sort of difference that makes."

The beer pours a dark cola brown to black coffee color with a spongey tan head of 1.5 cm foaming up on a gentle pour. This foam fades to a wispy edge layer in about 30 seconds.
The aroma on this beer is roasted malt, dark chocolate cocoa and a bit of bourbon and some fusol boozy notes. Hops do not make a presence known. Seems to be about what I expected from a blend of barrel aged Impy Stout and a Porter.
First sip reveals a medium body with very fine and tingly carbonation. Texture is fairly smooth and the beer drinks pretty easy on the physical traits.
Flavor is roasted malt, some charred wood, dark cocoa and then moves to some sweeter vanilla and a bit of bourbon to mix with the earlier malt notes. The bourbon and barrel lingers a bit on the finish, but this isnt fusol or warming booze here Also no real hop presence on this one anywhere. 
This is a pretty solid drinker and maybe a little dangerously so at the ABV. Im enjoying this beer and it actually is pretty much what I expect from the blend listed on the can."

Black with a short but persistent buzz cut. Aroma brings strong brown sugar, Coke, & a downdraft of bourbon. 

Mezclar is tough to nail down. There’s a touch of smoke, which I mention up front though it’s not the strongest element, but it’s one I am sensitive to. I’m a sensitive guy. Brown sugar & bourbon on the line, with smaller elements of nutmeg, Meg Myers, & a cut of booze. Nice. Slicing the can in half was the right move, though. 

Solid. Was hoping for more from a great brewery."

the beer pours a dark black coffee color with no light passing through the glass. A dense tan head of 1.5cm foams up and fades slowly to a sturdy edge lining of my glass.
Aroma is roasted malts and coffee grounds. Nose is robust and is almost exactly what I expected from an imperial coffee stout that doesnt have any lactose or other adjuncts. No hop character and booze is well hidden.
First sip reveals a medium body with slightly sticky mouthfeel and very fine, fizzy carbonation. Beer does leave a little bit of a coating on my lips after each sip.
Flavor is exactly as the nose advertises, roasted malts almost to char and dark black coffee. No sweetness, no adjuncts, no hops, no booze. This feels like an olde school imperial stout example and it works very well for exactly what it is trying to do. Fun to try this impy stout and happy to have a local brewery making a nice beer. Id buy this one again for a bit of a time machine experience."

The chocolate malts really come through. 

This is truly a throwback beer. No adjuncts and literally no sweetness. The burnt wood and roasted barley just get amplified as it warms. The coffee is just so great on this one. Just ends up tasting like a VERY awesome Russian imperial stout. Mouthfeel is thick and viscous. Just a lovely beer."

2692,Radome,Barred,4.12,"Poured from a 16 oz can into a Saint Arnold Icon snifter. 

L - Appears a deepest mahogany color and opaque in the glass, but when held up to the light it can be seen this is a brown beer with ruby highlights and crystalline clarity. Tan to light brown head is thick and fluffy initially, then pulls back to a thin sheet with big lacing.

S - Strong coffee bean note dominates the nose, a dark and bitter roast, if not espresso. The coffee aroma may be blended with roasted barley malt, but it is difficult to tell where one ends and the other begins. No other components can be detected.

T - The flavors hold more complexity than the aromas, especially as the glass warms. The expected dark roast coffee/espresso is there, along with burnt grains, but later in the palate there is a slight sweetness. It seems to come from malt, but it manifests as a vague chocolate milk note. It gives a hint of sweetness that keeps the coffee and roasted grains from being astringent. Hops and fermentation character are not evident in the mix.

F - Thick body with a creamy and silky feel, but only off-dry in the finish, not cloying as you might expect with the first sip. Low carbonation. Medium hops bitterness (might be much higher on paper, but lost in the impression with so many other flavors and textures in the beer). Strong alcohol presence, but not hot or boozy. 

O - This is a very nice Imperial Stout with a definite coffee character, as expected. I found the aroma one-dimensional, but nice flavors and well-executed mouthfeel made me enjoy it more than I expected at first."

The smell is roasted malt, chocolate, coffee, some fruitiness..blueberries ( a difficult fruit for me to pick out), and Bourbon. 

The taste is roasted malt, yeah, definitely blueberries which are much more in my face than in the smell. Chocolate, vanilla, easy on the coffee. Somewhat sweet, no real bitterness. Nice and smooth, alcohol is well hidden. 

Luxurious mouthfeel, this is a winner in my book. Sadly, my last bottle."
2695,clayrock81,KBS - Blueberry,4,"Poured a black body with minimal head, and the beer has an aroma that I would basically describe as blueberry although you can get notes of chocolate and coffee. First taste that hits me is strong but not too strong (so neither too sweet or tart) blueberry, then touches of chocolate and roasted coffee along with some strong woodiness and a hint of booze in this medium-to-heavy body that is smooth and easy to drink. Beer finishes a little hot but mostly has a sweet finish that makes it a dangerous sipper."
2696,bobv,KBS - Blueberry,4.23,"12 ounce bottle packaged 07/10/23.

Moderate pour yields a one inch tan head over a black body with sticky lacing.

Nose of dark roasted malt, dark fruit, chocolate, with slight vanilla, slight coffee, and a bit of bourbon. As it warms, the blueberry comes front and center with a tad caramel.

Taste mirrors nose closely with a hint of sour blueberry on the tongue. Complex with a lot of sweetness going on. Finish is semi sweet and slightly bitter with dark chocolate, vanilla, and dark fruit and a bit of bourbon and oak.

Mouthfeel is good with near medium carbonation.

Overall, don't hurry with this one, as it needs to open up to reveal multiple layers of flavor. Definitely worth picking some up.

2697,defunksta,KBS - Blueberry,3.98,"Appearance: Pours a completely dark, jet black color with a thick and massive, heavy, dark tan head that lingers. SRM of 24. (4.25)

Aroma: Strong aromas of chocolate and vanilla emerge upfront. There's rich chocolate, fudge, with notes of mocha and coffee. There's some other sweet syrup and dark fruit flavors within with mild hints of bourbon. (4.25) 

Flavor: Strong flavors of dark chocolate, rich fudge, amongst an underlying dark fruit upfront. Blueberries could be within. Then comes a coffee roast followed by a bourbon, syrup, and dark fruit sweetness that wipes everything else away. Some blueberry sweetness within that. Finishes sweet. (4.00) 

Feel: Heavier-bodied, average carbonation. Finishes sweet, smooth, and heavy. (3.50) 

Overall: First try at this one. The KBS with the addition of blueberries. It's dark, rich, and sweet. The blueberries don't add much blueberry flavors as much as a generic dark fruit and sweetness to it. Slightly too sweet I think so not the best version of the KBS. I think I prefer the original or Chocolate Cherry. Hard to know without a side-by-side. It's good, but not great. (Rating: 3.98)"

2702,rodbeermunch,KBS - Blueberry,3.95,"One of those beers I'm willing to actually buy at Total Warm. Pours black. Seems like a thinner head than regular KBS. Otherwise looks about the same. 

The aroma does impart blueberry. You lose some of the coffee smells from regular KBS. Opportunity cost as they used to say in economics before the empaths took over. Do you ""feel"" me? What a clown. Anyhoo, blueberry, light bourbon, mild sweet chocolate. 

The taste is about the sweetest KBS. And chocolate cherry was up there. I like it more than espresso. Probably more than chocolate cherry. Not as much as fudge. Nor the original. You really trade off the blueberry flavor, which make no mistake, its a well made blueberry stout . . . but you lose a bit of the roasty and coffee aspects of the stout. Should be interesting to see what happens with these over time. Will revisit scoring. The mouthfeel is pretty silky and easy, should be with all that sugar. Vanilla seems constant. 

Easy enough to drink 12oz solo. Not enough barrel aged stouts are like that."
2703,dcotom,KBS - Blueberry,4.63,"Poured from 12-ounce bottle into a long-stemmed goblet. Deep blackish-brown with a purple-ish tinge and a thick, long-lasting tan head. Heavenly aromas and flavors of chocolate and blueberries, with notes of coffee, molasses, licorice, and char. Slightly boozy but not overly so. Surprisingly little bourbon barrel character comes through. Syrupy and silky mouthfeel, sweet but not cloying, restrained bitterness, and a delightfully dry finish with just a touch of lingering sweetness and astringence. Founders nails it yet again. World class."
2704,DaveMaciolek21,KBS - Blueberry,4.44,"Dense black pour with glints of deep blueish-purple. Motor oil viscosity with no head to speak of. There's a lot to like here: smooth deep blueberry flavor, complemented by vanilla, chocolate and coffee. There's an incredible smoothness to this stout which glides down the hatch. A slight bit of sour bite in this finish--coffee tannins? Beautifully blended with no discernible booziness despite the epic 11.2% ABV."
2705,SpeedwayJim,"Hello, Antarctica",3.83,"16oz. can into a Side Project snifter. 

Pours a slick pitch black. Thin but oily mocha legs with great stick. No head, spotty, sparse lace. Nose is milk chocolate, vanilla, toasted coconut, cocoa powder, and lactose. Aromatic. Beer opens milk chocolate, chocolate syrup, and coconut. Condensed milk, vanilla, and more milk chocolate in the middle. A touch of cocoa powder and a light tartness from the roasted malt towards the finish. Body is light to medium with low carbonation. Slick on the palate and goes down luscious and soft. Long, lingering aftertaste. 

Great feel and the flavor profile is there but like most of their stout offerings recently this one hits a touch too sweet for me."
2706,brewandbbq,"Hello, Antarctica",4.25,"16oz can. 

Pours opaque dark brown with a short head of tan. Minimal retention or lacing. Dark chocolate, espresso, nougat in the nose. Full bodied with a velvety, lush mouthfeel. Brownie batter, Kahlua, fudge, and faint peanut on the palate. Finishes sweet and fudgy."
2707,DavetotheB,Time Trial,4.19,"From an undated can (strange for Tree House) into a tulip.

Pours an opaque yellowish orange with about a finger and a half of white head. Very good retention and lacing.

I'll never get over how great Tree House DIPAs smell. Big aromas of pineapple, mango, orange and a hint of peach.

Taste is great but without the ""wow"" factor of the nose. Tropical fruit and citrus with light bitterness on the backend.

Medium to full-bodied soft mouthfeel. Medium carbonation. Light bitter aftertaste.

Great DIPA. Tree House makes better but this will beat 95% of what you can find on the shelf in these parts."
2708,SawDog505,Time Trial,4.19,"Poured into a 16 oz tulip glass canned on 10/27/23. Pours an attractive hazy yellow with a solid finger sticky white head that leaves thick streaks of lace with excellent retention. 4.5

Aroma is peach, mandarin, honey dew, apricot, white grapes, and pink grapefruit rind. 4.25

Taste follows peach, mandarin, honey dew, apricot, white grapes, and pink grapefruit. 4.25

Mouthfeel is bigger than average, soft gentle carbonation, maybe a tad sticky and dry, and at 8% big flavor and easy enough going down. 4

Overall this is not a favorite from them, still very nice and I am not sad I have more. 4"
2709,Sheppard,Time Trial,3.54,"Pours a golden hazy, different from the yellow squash/cantaloupe and the cantaloupe colored IPAs I've opened and reviewed from Tree House earlier today. White head with good retention. Riwaka really dominates the nose on this one. I get some guava, banana, and some lime. This kind of falls flat from a flavor stand point. Not that much bursting hop character vs some of the other DIPAs I've had from TH."
2710,tigg924,Time Trial,4.49,"Had on tap at Charlton. Pours hazy, orange gold in color with minimal head. Taste is tangerine gummies and white grape. Medium heavy body, moderate carbonation, slightly bitter....really good stuff."
2711,Darkmagus82,Time Trial,4.27,"Poured from a can into a pint glass
Appearance – The beer pours a supper hazy yellow-orange color with a one finger head of puffy white foam. The head fades slowly over time to leave tons of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – The aroma of the brew is quite strong of a super big orange juice and massive grapefruit aroma mixed with some smells of pine and herbal hop. Along with these smells comes a little bit of a floral aroma with lots of grass and hay. There’s also some nice raw hop smells as well as a bit of papaya and passionfruit and a little bit of pepper and thyme. 
Taste – The taste starts out with a strong flavor of grapefruit hop mixed with lots of orange, tangerine, and papaya mixed with some flavors of a nice raw herbal hop. Along with these flavors comes a little bit of a floral taste with notes of hibiscus and a tulip like smell. As the taste advances there is a increase in the breadiness and doughy nature of the brew all while the herbal flavors get more intense at the expense of some of the grapefruit. Toward the end a little bit of white peppercorn and hay come to the tongue, leaving one with a rather pleasant and more “raw” hopped taste to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is very thick and chewy with a moderate carbonation. For the tastes and the style the feel is quite nice and makes for a very easy sipper.
Overall – A very nice brew overall with lots of big flavor and a fresh hop taste. Quite nice."
2712,zeff80,Speedway Stout - Affogato Edition,4.23,"16oz can. Poured out an opaque, jet-black color with a small, light brown head of foam. It left sticky rings of lace on the glass. It smelled of roasted coffee, vanilla beans, chocolate and toffee. Strong bitter coffee taste with chocolate, toffee and vanilla."
2713,Grax,Speedway Stout - Affogato Edition,4.25,"Aroma gives off some roasted coffee, dark malt, twinge of sweet vanilla. The body is a complex hit of coffee and vanilla ice cream rolling out on a creamy carpet to some fudge and molasses. Affogato might be a strong way to describe it, as the espresso generally dominates, but as usual you can't go wrong with Speedway Stout. Great beer all around."
2714,DefenCorps,Speedway Stout - Affogato Edition,3.88,"Can from Market of Choice. 

As with all Speedway variants, this looks great. The nose has lovely, rich, bitter dark chocolate, a strong dark roast coffee character, burnt sugar and vanilla bean. The vanilla is a little overpowering, leading to it smelling paradoxically fake. This is clearer on the palate where the sweetness from the vanilla clashes, rather than complements, with the bitter coffee and dark chocolate flavors."
2715,sjrider,Speedway Stout - Affogato Edition,4.27,Can pour - dark as a moonless night with big foamy khaki head leaving frosty lacing. Nose is roasty malt and espresso with a hint of vanilla. Taste follows with a lingering mild bitterness and a tiny bit of alcohol creep noticeable on the creamy finish. Damn tasty.
2716,RaulMondesi,Speedway Stout - Affogato Edition,4,"Back in the day, it seemed that when a brewery made a variant of an already good beer, it was a huge step up (like Candice Swanepoel getting bigger juggies). But those days are gone. A lot of silly variants are like, silly, or maybe even suck nowadays. And right here in Affogato, it’s ok, but I rather have regular Speedway, ya feel me? Affo is pencil thin Taylor Swift (which is fine), when we all know current va va voom Taylor is better). Ooo baby I’m feelin’ delicate."
2717,Blogjackets,Speedway Stout - Affogato Edition,4.69,"Poured from a pint can dated 7-27-23, the body is jet black with a small initial head. Moderate lacing.

Nose is espresso and toasty malt. Inviting!

Taste follows nose and is a coffee stout lover’s dream. Good malty char, well expressed espresso flavor, and nuanced vanilla flavor that complements but does not overshadow the other flavors. No sign of the ABV.

Note: after a quick sip for initial flavor check I let this beer stand for more than thirty minutes then sipped for hours. The initial astringency from espresso when cold faded as the stout warmed.

Mouthfeel is luxurious with solid carbonation.

Super flavorful, easy drinking big old coffee stout. Heaven on a cool autumn night. A near perfect coffee stout for my tastes."
2718,highdesertdrinker,Speedway Stout - Affogato Edition,4.5,"Pours dark brown/black with decent head and lacing. The aroma is vanilla, espresso, heat. The taste is an explosion of flavor, strong coffee, espresso, vanilla, hoppy bitterness, and a sturdy roasted malt. I’ve had many different versions of Speedway Stout and this is a nice beer worthy of name and tradition, cheers!"
2719,ilikebeer03,Speedway Stout - Affogato Edition,4.5,"Drank 9/30/23. Canned 8/15/23.
Pour is a dense, jet black with a creamy head of light cinnamon foam. great lacing and retention
Nose is fresh, roasty coffee, rich vanilla, latte, 
Taste is a wonderfully balanced vanilla, latte, fresh roasted coffee, espresso, roasted malt, light char. slight warming in the stomach
Smooth, creamy body.
Excellent beer."
2720,jzeilinger,Speedway Stout - Affogato Edition,4.24,"A - Pitch black with dense toffee colored lacing.

S - Nice char and coffee on the nose.

T - Vanilla, Espresso / coffee, lots of char on the back end and lingering Espresso and chocolate char.

M - Big medium body that's really dry on the back of the tongue.

O - This is really nicely done and recommended."
2721,BEERchitect,Bravissimo,4.3,"Giving their Bravo brown ale a major facelift, Firestone Walker elevates the beer to barleywine status with barrel aged treatment and blending to create the best version that Bravo can be.

Pouring medium to dark brown, Bravissimo carries an ominous and rusty haze while topping off with a cream ivory tan froth. As it scent rolls from the rim, the nose is caught by a robust and savory perfume swirling with chocolate, toast, maple, whisky and wood. Expectedly sweet once on the tongue, an early malt impact reinforces those maple, molasses, chocolate, vanilla and caramel flavors.

Smooth, creamy and plush with malt, the middle palate is a direct carryover of those initial flavors. Adding the complexities of dark coffee, heavy toast, light char and roasted walnut, the more sultry and almost smokey add an earthen balance that's much needed against the sweetness. Lightly bittered, gritty and husken in its finish, the spice of rye blends with bourbon quite well.

Full bodied, sweet, velvety and warm, Bravissimo finishes off-cloying and with a malty-sweet taste that extends into a bittersweet and spicy aftertaste."
2722,sjrider,Bravissimo,4.34,"Bottle pour- murky, turbid brown bilge water with khaki head leaving scattered lacing. Nose is sweet with brown sugar, bready malt and dark stone fruit. Taste follows like a boozy maple bar that lingers on a creamy finish. Looks questionable and tastes fantastic!"
2723,Beersnake,Bravissimo,4.34,"Poured at cellar temp into a hotel plastic cup. Pours a light brown with a good 2 inches of head. The nose is full of lovely malts, bread, brown sugar, biscuits, and some dark fruit. The taste is so smooth. Sponge toffee, brown sugar, maple, bourbon, and vanilla. Just lovely."
2724,DIM,Bravissimo,4.4,"This is subtlety sweet and silky smooth, a real treat. Maple cream, chocolate croissants, brown sugar, and beautifully well incorporated high end bourbon all come together harmoniously. A gem, should have bought more than one."
2725,pants678,Bravissimo,4.02,"Tan foam, very dark brown.

Caramel-ish.

Subtly bitter and subtly sweet, would like more of the latter. Slight lean toward caramel or coffee. More muted than the name suggests, IMO. Bit of harsh barrel of wood.

Cola-esque, not dry."
2726,JohnnyHopps,Life Jacket,4.18,"Appearance - Tge beer was murky brown in color, and very dense.

Smell - The malts were bold with notes of coconut and stone fruit.

Taste - The malts and caramel of Straight Jacket were apparent. Coconut, molasses, caramel, bourbon, and pineapple followed. This was loaded. The 15% abv left a little burn at the finish. 

Mouthfeel - Low carbonation, thick body. There was viscosity here. 

Overall - Odd, but very drinkable."
2727,WickedBeer,Life Jacket,4.45,"The pour is a deep, brown-hued crimson, with beige carbonation rising to about two fingers of head before quickly settling entirely into the body of the beer.

The nose bursts out of the gate with dark chocolate-covered tropical fruits. An initially subtle toasted coconut component quickly intensifies, as well as clearer notes of guava. Sipping further seems to stir up lots of stone fruit aromas. That said, overall with warmth the fruit mellows and the profile on the nose begins to hone in closer to a traditional barleywine; raisin, caramel, and that bourbon barrel taking more precedence.

The malty underbody of this beer really shines on the palate bolstering the brighter, mildly tannic notes of stone fruit and mango. The passionfruit intensifies the fruit and adds just a kiss of tartness, but it rides the line perfectly with a chocolate-powered rigidity on the mid-palate. While initially it was surprising that coconut wasn't more noticeable, the more the profile was studied the more it became apparent that all the other tropical inclusions to this beer wouldn't have been able to work with the barleywine base without the behind-the-scenes influence of mild nutty bitterness and milky coconut sweetness.

Revolution has never been known for big-bodied high gravity beers. That said, they've never needed to. With expert balance of adjuncts, carbonation, and base weight, the mouthfeel on this one really works. We agreed that the slightly thinner feel to this worked much better with the fruit than a beer with a higher finishing gravity would have. The carbonation is effervescent and matches any residual tannin or tartness from the fruit, and it finishes with a bitterness from the coconut that works to build up the warmth and oak character from the bourbon barrels."
2728,stevoj,Life Jacket,4.01,"12oz can from Tavour. Dark amber pour, a few buubles that disappear. Aroma is malty, pit fruit, and some booze. Taste is malty, raisins, fig, tobacco and a pleasnt warmth."
2729,micada,Life Jacket,4.31,"Aroma comes off like an old ale, with a dark clear amber color to match. The flavor is intriguing. The tropical flavors all show up in the sips, but are beat back with that powerful barrel presence and bourbon bite. At the end, a sweet caramel English barleywine vibe comes in to coat the tongue. Crisp, but with a heavy mouthfeel. I really thought from the beginning that this would be a blend of confusion, not quite as horrifying as the Other Half garbage plate “barleywine” with potato chips and every other absurd adjunct possible, but Rev pulls off a nice balancing act where the “Jacket” flavor maintains a clear thread throughout."
2730,maximum12,Life Jacket,4.7,"Already had this on tap three times & hoping the 12 oz. cans are equally rod-creating. 

The pour is dark with ruby-inspired glints around the edges (& when held up to the light). Nose brings tropical sweetness with a healthy hit of bourbon & booze. 

Life Jacket should be standard equipment with every orange vest. Following the nose there’s a huge hit of bourbon/booze up front, followed by a gentle, warm breeze of tropical fruits (mango is the only body I can ID). Mid-palate brings coconut & caramel at much lower levels before the finish is slaughtered by the barrel, both oak & bourbon. Sticky but not heavy, given its ABV this should have a “DANGER” label slapped on the can. 

Another Revolution Victory. Ho hum. I didn’t know what to expect reading the initial description of this beer & certainly didn’t expect to be blown away. I am."
2731,beergoot,Life Jacket,4.47,"Brownish red look on the pour, deep ruby hued in the glass in the light; dark brown in the shadows; clear; thin, wispy ring of foam inside the glass. Intensely dense and elaborate nose; plum and tobacco; plum brandy; oak. The taste amplifies the smell; darkly sweet plum and fig; cherry; earthy booziness. Heavy mouthfeel; slick and oily; sweet and boozy feel.

Deep and alluring in character, this juicy booze bomb draws you in deep. Incredibly flavorful.

2732,stortore,Life Jacket,4.35,"12 ounce can into a snifter. Canned 7/13/23, had 9/1/23. Also had on tap at the release.

Pours a clear copper color with no head and a few specks of cling. Aromas of caramel, oak, malt, some bourbon, fig, passion fruit, raisins, brown sugar, some char, light mango and coconut. Flavors of bourbon, mango, caramel, malt, passion fruit, coconut, oak, brown sugar, light fig. Smooth, a solid medium body, appropriately carbonated. 

Liked it on tap and liked the can even better. The base is excellent, which is a good sign for this year’s Straight Jacket. For me, the fruit was mostly passion fruit, but the combo works very well with the base. Very enjoyable and underrated."
2733,ovaltine,Life Jacket,4.5,"This beer pours a surprisingly clear mahogany brown, but settles with a ruby hue as you gaze through it, and sports a sizzling tan colored head that is quick to vacate the premises. A beautiful barleywine, IMHO.

I didn’t know what to expect on the nose, given the listed notes of mango, guava, passion fruit, and coconut (which are all present in varying degrees), but I was very pleased that the requisite toffee and caramel notes I expect with an English barleywine were very present, as well as the barrel notes. Wow, is there a LOT going on here.

The taste features the barrel notes (which pull in the coconut) and caramel and toffee notes, which are all delicious (and very warming at the very back of the palate in the case of the barrel), but this beer is all about the tropical mango, guava, and especially passion fruit flavors, which complement rather than compete with the traditional barleywine flavors. 

Very specifically, how does a beer this big (15.04% ABV) drink as “light” (it’s not) and refreshing as this one does, without compromising the base beer? That, to me, is a sign of a world class brewery, one that knows where it wants to take its beers.

And I am so very glad I get to enjoy their adventures."
2734,Phyl21ca,Oaked Julius,3.98,Can: Poured a hazy deep golden color ale with a large white foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of hoppy citrusy notes with some residual sugar notes and juicy hops. Taste is also a mix of citrusy hops notes with some juicy hops notes with some slightly cloying sugar notes.Body is about average for style with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol notes. Interesting but the barrel seems to have created a cloying sugary feel that I didn't appreciate.
2735,ovaltine,Oaked Julius,4.35,"Pours a hazy orange color with a creamy white head that provides significant lacing. Beautiful hazy. The nose features ripe oranges, lots of mango, and a subtle oak note. I’m intrigued.

The taste is led by delicious ripe orange flavors and equally delicious mango flavors, with the oak more pronounced on the taste than it was on the nose, residing at the back of the palate and supplanting the creamy oat flavor that is ubiquitous with TH hops, but actually working really well.

The mouthfeel is medium and soft, as expected with a TH beer. This is a really interesting take on an OG hazy, and one I’d gladly revisit."
2736,WunderLlama,Oaked Julius,4.25,"Brewers notes: (American IPA, 6.8% ABV, 16oz) Oaked Julius is a brew that evokes a profound sense of nostalgia while simultaneously representing a bold foray into a new brewing endeavor. It is an homage to nature's time-tested elements, crafted with our unwavering commitment to innovation and the pursuit of progress. Oaked Julius is crafted first with the base Julius recipe and then aged in oak barrels. Following its slumber in oak, it is dry-hopped a second time prior to final conditioning. The result is a transformative fusion of classic and contemporary, a beer that pours a hypnotic hazy orange hue beneath a cap of creamy foam. It greets your senses with a bouquet of citrus, subtle vanilla, and the unmistakable, mellow resonance of oak. The first sip reveals a symphony of flavor characterized by recognizable Julius flavors of bright mango and citrus rounded out by American oak. 

Can dates 8.28.23, opened 9.4, poured into a teku glass, deep hazy orange capped by a yellowish off white creamy foam , settles to a solid layer with streaky lacings 

Aroma is orange citrus, oak, whiff of mango 

Taste is orange citrus , not as vibrant as Julius, muted by the oak ageing and flavoring, oak , hint of mango 

Soft , smooth mouthfeel , creamy sudsing , semi dry finish 

Good beer , interesting version of a classic. The classic still stands supreme"
2737,tigg924,Oaked Julius,4,"Had on tap. Pours hazy, orange gold in color with one inch head. Taste is oak and mango. medium body, moderate carbonation, bitter. Good beer that is on a solid Julius base but not one of my favorite variants. Glad I tried but no need for a four pack. The Julius batch to make this was spot on."
2738,Newbeergeek1,Oaked Julius,4.67,"I was just there a couple of weeks ago and I totally lucked out with this Oaked Julius. Right place right time. I am a huge TH fan and having 7 more of these in my fridge to savor is a joy. Aging in an oak bbl is genius. Lots of lacing, pours bright but hazy orange, and just smooth smooth smooth. I don’t know if they will ever brew this again but I sure hope so and hope I am around if it’s available. I think it’s better than Julius which is an amazing brew."
2739,TheIPAHunter,Ben Is Dead,4.5,"Haze so thick it's almost green. Nose is tropical lemon and lime. Taste is calamansi, candied grapefruit, mango, and lime. Thick, creamy mouthfeel. Astringent, mouth-drying, citrus rind bitterness. Effing delicious."
2740,kitch,Ben Is Dead,4.41,"A 1 pint can, canned on 3rd May 2023, poured into a winebar glass.

Appearance: A hazy milky pale yellow colour with a two finger white head that had decent retention, while leaving nice lacing.

Aroma: Citrusy, grapefruit, orange rind, lemon zest, with light notes of tropical guava and mango. 

Taste: Light sweet notes, grapefruit pith and rind, lime zest, melon, mango, pineapple, with a lasting bitter finish.

Mouthfeel: Light to medium bodied with moderate carbonation.

Overall: An easy drinking NEDIPA with great aromas and flavours."
2741,jrc1093,Ben Is Dead,4.05,"Canned on 5/3/23; consumed on 6/7/23

Pours a turbid, pale off-gold body capped with a finger and a half of creamy, slightly off-white foam; decent head retention leaves a paper-thin cap, a moderate, fluffy collar, and myriad sudsy, webby/spotty lacing spattered across the walls of the glass.

Aromas bring cream of wheat, grapefruit zest, and strawberry esters upfront, with mushy guava residuals meeting sweet mango in the distance as a hint of potent, waxy white grape and tinges of musty honey linger along a sweaty hop undercurrent.

Taste offers lime Pixie Stix and mushy strawberry esters alongside soft cream of wheat in the backdrop; grapefruit peel on the mid-palate leads to musty mango and shreds of dank white grape on the finish.

Mouthfeel shows a moderate-light body and a fluffy, moderate-high carbonation, with prevailing juiciness fading to pseudo-bitterness through the mid-palate as a subtle, hoppy twang supports a taut, largely clean finish.

Eclectic and zesty while contrastingly boggy yet bright, this NEDIPA produces a uniquely varied array of character in flux with a quintessentially soft R+B body; an excellent offering in the style."
2742,StonedTrippin,Baby Kiwis,4.2,"cool to have this right after the baby kittens, which i also really liked, this seems similar but done with new zealand hops, i did get some of that character i thought in the original too, but it really pops in this, a tad stronger and more intense, also a bit fresher to me overall, a bit fuller feeling too but still drinkable enough for what it is, these guys are making some wicked hoppy beer at the moment! some legit murk to this, orange juicy looking, some sediment and density, but a fat inch of airy white head from the pint can too. the nose and taste are real close, hints of coconut, lemongrass, green lawn, and mango, light sweetness seems to enhance and extend it, papaya, apricot, peach, some similarities to the baby kittens on the grain side too, lightly baked, very round and expansive feeling, quite a lot of structure but not a belly bomb. juicy and flavorful, definitely southern hemisphere hops, kiwi fruit, resin, coconut, lightly green. the grain flavor is solid, and this has some summery character even though its fuller. perhaps a tad light on carbonation, and it does get a touch heavier as it warms, but overall very good, awesome hop profile and a lot to like. i need to get my hands on some more ipa cans from these guys, been more and more stoked on them of late..."
2743,BEERchitect,Baby Kiwis,4.21,"Well, well, well... if it isn't another cat is out of the bag. The brewers of Fat Orange Cat set out for the lands down under for a New Zealand type of bitterness that brings both tantalizing, tropical, vinous and botanical bite to the New England-styled IPA.

Pouring a matte lemony finish over a pastel depth of straw, Baby Kiwis starts to reel off fruit aromatics of citrus, tropical fruit, herbal notes and wine as soon as the froth starts to pull from the beer's body. Generous sweetness layers upon the tongue like pastry dough laced with honey, shortcake and cereal.

But once the hops gain strength the middle palate is all about the sassy fruit impressions. With a bold sense of tangerine, mandarin and lemon, a bright citrus and taste takes shape. With hints of pineapple, white grapefruit, passionfruit and papaya, the fruit culmination is in full swing. As the ale extends into the late palate, the fruit turns to that of citrus peels, grape skins and tropical fruit rinds in a gentle bitterness of green tea, fresh spruce and fine botanical herb in a gin-like sort of way.

Medium bodied but leaning on the fuller side, the hazy IPA starts plush with malt starches but finishes malty-dry with a mild gin-like spice and a medium-long aftertaste of chive, hemp and spruce tips."
2744,dd53grif,Baby Kiwis,4.4,Pours a hazy yellow color with a minimal white head that lasts quite a while. Aroma of tropical fruits. Taste is tangy grapefuit. Only a slightly bitter finish.
2745,Hilltopper,Baby Kiwis,4.45,"Whoa ... this is tasty! If you enjoy a dank finish from your cloudy IPA's, this one delivers. I'd put it in a league with Heady Topper in that regard. As a matter of fact, I've got a fresh Heady and a fresh Baby Kiwi side by side right now. Both are bringing the dank the way I like it. The Baby Kiwi leaves me with a fruity dankness that hits the spot. Fat Orange Cat has a winner here. If you're into southern tier hops, grab a Baby Kiwi."
2746,Specialmick,Baby Kiwis,4.25,"Look...Straw yellow with a bunch of haze carbonated white small bubble head. Appealing 
Smell...Pleasant smell of resin hops. A dank reminder of the fact that the hop and weed are cousins. Decisive
Taste...a unique but good citrus and you can really taste the hops mmm, . A drying fruity bitterness with a good balancing act that really works
Feel....Juicy with a good amount of texture . Definitive quality that really moves this beer forward. 
Overall...I am not sure I rated this high enough but I am close. This is a high quality beer and why I will continue to try the 800 varieties (just kiddin) of Fat Orange Cat. Definitely worth a selection for the style"
2747,Jw13,Slow Burn,4.46,"A Märzen made with smoked malt. Pours a slightly hazy copper. Smells of malt and noble hops, but no smoke that I could detect. The smokiness is there in the taste though, although you have to look for it. Lots of malt in the flavor, but not too sweet. Very nice.

Edit: a second can had a much more noticeable smoke presence, and was a little sweeter than the above suggests."
2748,tigg924,Slow Burn,4.53,"Had on tap at Sandwich. Pours murky, copper in color with one inch head. Taste is big smoke and toasted malt. Medium body, high carbonation, smoky and slightly sweet. Good for the style. Cannot raise a stein to Schlenkerla but great for an American alternative....nothing beats the original. My kind of beer."
2749,DefenCorps,La Magie,4.25,"Can from Uptown Market.

A clear straw yellow with a dense, white head with good retention and lacing. The nose is clean, bright, soft, floral with an earthy, mildly minty hop character. Nice, clean cracker-crisp malt character with nice snap. The palate opens briskly carbonated, complementing the crisp, clean malt character and floral hop notes. This makes this a particularly refreshing beer. Drying, snappy, floral on the finish. Lovely."
2750,Iamaskier,La Magie,4.26,"L: One finger head, golden straw colored body. 
S: Sourdough, cracker malt, a hint of cloves. 
T: The hops are out front, not in a big way but present and bringing a floral bitterness. Next comes the malt, dough and cracker, slightly sweeter. Finishing things off are the hints of clove and spice. 
F: Very crisp, nice dry finish. 
O: Superb. Crisp, great flavor, fantastic balance."
2751,mothman,La Magie,4.35,"French pils. Can. White head with lace. Clear straw yellow.

So dang smooth. Hard to put my glass down."
2752,beergoot,La Magie,4.51,"Sharp and clear body, golden hued; dense, lively carbonation; thick head, white and foamy. Splendid floral scent with gentle notes of tropical fruit; hint of lightly toasted grain. Wonderful flavor; honey malt and notes of cracker and biscuit; moderately intense hop bitterness; very delicate herbal notes. Medium body; soft and velvety; mild warmth undercurrent.

This is one of the best pilsners I've had, ever. I'm not completely sure what a French-style pilsner is unless its just the use of French Strisselspalt hops listed on the can. I've never heard of that hop varietal, but I'm guessing it's key to this beer's overall fantastic quality and drinkability. I sure hope to come across this beer again.

Rustic loaf, mild malt, lemon peel, touch of floral hops all combine. Nose is yeast and hop driven form of this combo, with the light citrus melding into that rustic yeast so nicely. Feel is amazing, so light and artful with some airiness while being smooth and yeast forward with malt backbone. Great with cheese board! Perfect rustic pilsner on a summer country night"
2754,MaltsOfGlory,La Magie,4.14,"16oz can

Pours two fingers of white head into my Willi. Retention is average and the head mostly fades after a couple of minutes. Lacing is sparse. Body is golden yellow, crystal clear, with a moderate amount of bubbles coming up. Looks ok.

Nose has a nice pronounced spicy hop profile, bready malt hides underneath. Pretty significant sweetness, for a Pilsner. Despite the sweetness, this smells really clean, and the hop clarity/freshness is absolutely wonderful.

Flavor leans more on the malt than the hops. Breadiness up front, some underlying grass, but unfortunately no spice, some lemon comes in at the finish. Overall it tastes good, but safe.

Carbonation is medium-high. Light body, but the carbonation ads a lot of mouthfeel. Bitterness is lowish. Not terribly sweet or overly dry, pretty well balanced - I recall it coming across a lot sweeter out of the can. Overall it’s a nice and crisp mouthfeel.

Drinkability is very good.

Overall a nice little Pilsner."

Smell: Tropical fruit blossoms, pineapple chips, nectarines, peaches with lesser, lights hints of gooseberry and pine. Softly bready with a drizzle of housemade oat milk.

L - Rich golden color, almost a light copper; slightly hazy, but gives an orange glow when held up to the light. Gentle bone-colored head that stays light and wispy but never disappears entirely.

S - Warm, malt aroma of lightly toasted white bread. Barrel-aging shines through with strong coconut and oak notes, along with a hint of strong booze that is not really recognizable as bourbon. Neither hops nor yeast really emerge on the nose.

T - The flavors reflect the aromas well. There is a soft breadiness from malt that is rounded out by light booze and soft coconut. Again, the bourbon is not distinct, but there is a slight spiciness that might be the whiskey playing around the edges. There is great depth of flavor.

F - Medium to thick body shows some sweetness but finished mostly dry. Low but creamy carbonation. Strong hops bitterness that seems lower due to the sweetness. Strong alcohol warmth, but does not overwhelm you with booziness.

O - This is a strong, warming beer, but it gives an overall soft and comfortable impression. It is dangerously drinkable and delicious despite its strength and body."

A slightly hazy dark amber, its white head has plenty of character slowly leaving a lacy trace. The flavor is very good. At first taste there was something and then I realized it was the bourbon. I've had bourbon beers before and have gotten gradually acclimated to them, but this one is GOOD. 
This may be my new favorite beer. It's golden rich with flavor. Yes indeed, we may have to change our Publix store."

It pours a lightly hazy gold with oodles of foam that settle down to aboot a half inch. Very nice lacing. 

It smells spicy, there's Bourbon, some Belgian yeasty nose. Light hints of cloves, an aroma reminiscent of candi sugar, lactose. 

The taste is Bourbon, lactose, a sweetness, again, that reminds me of candi sugar, yeasty, overall, this is quite complex. 

Medium bodied with adequate carbonation, the ample abv is hidden pretty well. Worthy of a repurchase."
2774,Fordcoyote15,Dragons Milk - Tales of Gold,4.07,"Dragons milk got me into bourbon barrel aged beer many, many years ago so I've got to try these spin offs. I loved the red ale so was excited to try this one too until I just now read the bottle and see it has lactose. I'm not intolerant in the medical sense but I seem to be intolerant of enjoying any beer containing it. My enthusiasm for this beer is dramatically waning.

Also I think the name is retarded. Can I still say that in 2023? Fuck your pronouns too.

Oh yeah, the beer review:

Look is shit. Turbid tangerine colorored mess. Definitely not golden whatsoever. Head is pretty brilliantly white and pillowy. We'll give it a 4.

Smell is honestly just a lot of white sugar and not much else. Not impressive. Not malty. Absolutely zero hops detectable. Is this mead?

Taste is a solid. Quite fruity, extremely heavy barrel that taste less of bourbon and more of moonshine but I honestly find most BBA beers too tame on the barrel so I appreciate the kick. Very sweet. In fact, retardedly sweet. Oops. I doubt ill like this as much by the end given the sugar but initially I dig it. 4.25

Feel I really like. Extremely soft on the carbonation and very dense. But then again given the sugar its essentially the dead sea if you sub the NaCl for C12H22O11. Leaves you feeling a little dirty on the finish.

Overall. 4-4.25 but I gotta say closer to 4. Won't buy this one again despite rebuying the red ale 3 times. C for effort New Holland."

2779,dbrauneis,Fest of Both Worlds,4.05,"A: Pours a very lightly hazy medium golden yellow in color with moderate amounts of active visible carbonation rising quickly from the bottom of the glass and moderate bright yellow + straw yellow + honey colored highlights. The beer has a two finger tall dense sudsy foamy off-white head that slowly reduces to a large patch of medium thick film covering the entire surface of the beer and a medium thick ring at the edges of the glass. Moderate amounts of lacing are observed.

S: Moderate aromas of biscuit + pale + grainy + lightly toasted malts with a light amount of grainy sweetness. Moderate aromas of lager yeast. Light to moderate aromas of herbal + spicy + floral hops.

T: Upfront there are moderate flavors of biscuit + pale + grainy + lightly toasted malts with a light amount of grainy sweetness. That is followed by moderate flavors of lager yeast. Finally there are light to moderate flavors of herbal + spicy + floral hops which impart a light amount of bitterness which fades away after a moderate amount of time leaving a relatively clean finish.

M: Just shy of medium bodied with moderate amounts of carbonation. Crisp with a hint of dryness and a relatively clean finish.

O: Easy to drink with well hidden alcohol and a pleasantly refreshing crisp + dry + clean mouthfeel. Enjoyable and well balanced with malt sweetness + hop bitterness."

Bready malts on the crack of the can with some floral and peppery hops on the back end.

Super well-balanced taste. Hops and malt. Some light sweetness (caramel?) and breadiness mixed well with some spicy peppery hops. Neither dominating.

Full-bodied mouthfeel for the style. Maybe not as light as some festbiers. Medium carbonation. Light bitter hoppy aftertaste.

Just a lovely, most enjoyable beer."

Each sip or quaff is sweet, with a short flavor duration. Very easy to drink. Slight bitter balancing note arrives later on during the session."
2785,dano213,Fest of Both Worlds,4.18,"16oz can purchased off the shelf as a single for $3.37. Canned 09/12/23, so this is just over a month old.

Look: Pours a nice clear golden color that leans slightly towards copper. There was a nice fluffy white head that eventually died down to almost nothing. Lots of smallish bubbles are steadily rising up the glass.

Smell: I like the aromas going on here. I would say that the nose is hop-forward: it's predominantly earthy and spicy. Underneath, I get whiffs of a crackery, toasty malt character. Very nice toasted grain aroma that eventually comes through more. It smells very nice.

Taste: This is a very tasty beer. I think what is most impressive about it is how balanced and drinkable it is. There isn't one characteristic about this beer that blows me away, however it does combine all elements and brings them together in concert quite nicely. There is a lingering bitterness on the finish that gradually builds. I like how the toasted grain and crackery malt flavors come through and stop short of being sweet as they are held in check by the spicy, herbal, earthy hops. It's also really hard to believe that this beer is only 6% ABV. It just drinks so easily.

Feel: It's on the lighter side of medium bodied yet it has a good heft for its size along with a slight chewiness. Nicely carbonated.

Overall: It's a great collaboration beer and it tastes like a really authentic German Festbier to me. Compared to Weihenstephaner's or Paulaner's Festbier, I would say that this is pretty similar in many ways.

2786,izraelc,Fest of Both Worlds,4,Pours a pale yellow. Lacey foam. Malty aroma. Breast malt body fades to a lemony sweetness. Bright and refreshing. Goes down quick. Not really what I would consider an Oktoberfest but it's still quite good
2787,ryan1788a5,Fest of Both Worlds,4.08,"16oz can poured into a thin lager glass.

A: Golden color with a slight brassy pop of brightness. Awesome clarity. Three fingers of rocky white head display superb retention. Lacing is chunky and clumpy.

S: Beautifully delicate bready/grainy pils malt aroma. Good dose of floral hops with a green, grassy, and very slightly herbal scent. Yeast character is clean with the subtlest hints of its own floral, vaguely fruit skin-like character. Lightly musty and a touch steely. 

T: Opens with that pleasant and expected bready, crackery, and grainy pils malt. Slightest of treacle undertones. Yeast is a little more forward and musty than expected, but with a clean fermentation profile and perhaps a hint of fruit skin complexity. Fleeting burst of Juicy Fruit gum. Hops are earthy and start with a grassy and herbal pull. There are just the subtlest hints of pine and bark that let you know these are not pure noble hops. Bit of lime leaf. Bitterness is low and the hops and malt stay in harmonious balance. Finishes with a trailing bready/grainy sweetness and a hint of green grass and hop oil.

M: On the heftier side of light-bodied. Some definite melanoidin feel with a little bit of that full, rich chewiness. Ample carbonation is not stiff, but still has a light prickle around the tongue and just the right amount of lift and carbonic bite. Very minor hop astringency is perceptible.

O: It is billed as ""Old World Meets New,"" and it is, but the balance of things still feels like it stays more on the Old World end of the spectrum. I think that's the right call. We have a very nice traditional decoction mash and really great lager strain at work, and that is executed superbly. The hopping is what's new school, but they didn't go bonkers with it. The hop selection is a little safe. The Sterling and Adeena strains still have noble hop parentage IIRC, so they still complement the old world lager style rather than butting heads with it. There's just the slightest hints of pine and fruit that betray their mixed breed nature. Everything stays well balanced and works together without distractions. It isn't really a unique head-turner, but it's a damn solid beer that's just a little bit different. It's really hitting the spot with its high festbier drinkability, and to me that's the bottom line."
2788,Beersnake,Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Barleywine - 5 Year Aged,4.35,"Poured from a can at fridge temp. Pours a very dark brown with a good amount of light brown head. The nose is heavy on the booze. I can't say I'm surprised after 5 years in the barrel! Lots of bourbon and oak.

2789,DIM,Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Barleywine - 5 Year Aged,4.51,"Here again are the huge notes bourbon soaked caramel and butterscotch that I love so much about CW barleywines. No better unapologetically brazen, all-American barrel aged barleywines around regardless of price as far as I'm concerened. Extended aging adds extra richness and baker's chocolate while the hop presence is diminished. Glorious. It's been too long since I've had the 4 to compare accurately but I think the aroma is pretty similar. I think I taste more wood and baker's chocolate here. I'm loving this but I believe I slightly prefer the 4 year. The carbonation is gentle while the body is full and lightly sticky.

Overall an easy drinking, yet complex, elixir of loveliness."
2791,thebeers,Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Barleywine - 5 Year Aged,3.77,"Sits almost plum colored in the glass (although quite garnet when held to the light). It has a thin khaki head that’s fairly short-lived but sticks around slightly longer than younger vintages, leaving a surprisingly long-lasting and messy crown. There’s also some visible churning from the center once the head is gone.

Sweet and boozy smelling. I got strong cocoa when I first cracked the can, but once poured, cherry, fig, prune and vanilla stand out the most, with some stale hops behind.

The chocolate character does show fairly strongly up front in the taste, which is much less fruitier than the nose implied (although the prune, raisin and fig are all in there again). There’s also some nice wood, vanilla, caramel and distant piney hops.

Oily and slick feeling, with too much carbonation for the style. I don’t expect a barleywine to be belch inducing, and it honestly detracts from the taste.

I was hoping this age would be the best of the bunch, but I probably like it the least. It’s solid overall, but the over carbonation is hard to get past on what should be a slow savoring beverage like this."

Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is nice, the brew smells like dark fruit, rum, roasted malt, coffee and brown sugar. Taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of some burnt/charred malt, bourbon, dark chocolate, oak, dark bread and vanilla flavors. To me the rum barrel seems stronger than the bourbon. All the flavors work well together with no one flavor overpowering the others. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's slick and a bit rich with a moderate amount of carbonation.

Very sweet and almost floral or honeyed aroma. Much nuttier and richer on the palate. Some fairly classic imperial stout notes: pecan, modest char, cocoa, coffee, prune, banana, all quite balanced.

The nose is significantly brighter, grabbing you with huge mango, guava, and papaya notes, as well as a nice amount of mandarin orange and passion fruit. Wow.

The mango, guava, and papaya flavors are forward and striking on the taste - this is an exotic tropical fruit basket that is not shy, and allows mandarin orange and passion fruit flavors to flavors to shine as well. I could literally drink a keg of this.

The mouthfeel is full, soft, and a smidge creamy, absolutely masking any presence of the 8% ABV. The first beer I had in this series, #1 with the house yeast, was very good, but didn’t really “pop.” This version, with Thiolized yeast, has all the pop of a massive 4th of
July celebration. World class, IMHO."
2807,Roguer,Data Set #4,4.56,"As compared to the house yeast Data Set, this one has a much more expressive head.

Incredibly expressive nose, absolutely bursting with notes of juice. Melon, papaya, guava, mint, mild to moderate dankness, pineapple, tangerine. This one absolutely explodes at you.

The same flavor profile translates to the palate. It works better as an aroma, however. There’s something almost watery about the flavor, like papaya and guava juice but watered down. It is also noticeably danker, which is remarkable given that we typically associate those flavors with hop varietals and hop age, but in this case, the only difference is what the yeast draws out of everything else.

This is pretty darn amazing. As an experiment, it clearly shows how much the yeast brings to the flavor profile. I'm not quite sure how this one seems to come across as creamier than Data Set #1, but enjoying them side by side, it's undeniable (the watery aspect I mentioned applies to the flavor, not the feel)."
2808,brewme,Data Set #4,4.5,"Picked-up a single can as part of a mixed four pack of this series for about twenty dollars. My three hundred and seventh brew from these guys. Canned on date of 3/16/23. Excellent, best of the data sets."
2809,skisonic,Tall Kiwi,4.46,"Pours a beautiful frothy pale gold
Smells lovely, citrus odor climbing out of my glass. Mango, mandarin orange, a touch of lemon 
Taste follows the nose, not too sweet, flavor is refined and a bit muted. Primarily grapefruit, mango on the tongue.
Well-hopped, dry and finishes cleanly. 
A stand-out."
2810,vette2006c5r,Tall Kiwi,4.28,"Tall Kiwi pours a hazy yellow color with a smallish, long-lasting, lacing head. The aroma has notes of peaches and passion fruit. The flavor is sweet, fizzy, and with notes of dry mangos, peaches, and passionfruit. Overall, it's a nice tropical fruity beer."
2811,edthehead,Tall Kiwi,4.44,"Hazy pale yellow appearance with a fizzy head, decent retention, minimal lacing. Grapefruit, star fruit, peach notes. Moderate to thick body, medium carbonation."
2812,VABA,Tall Kiwi,4,"Pours a nice hazy amber golden color with a slight head and lacing
Aroma has nice tropical and citrus hints
The taste follows the nose with a pleasant tropical and citrus flavor
A medium bodied well carbonated beer
A good NEIPA"
2813,ovaltine,Data Set #2,4.35,"Pours a very hazy pale straw color with a creamy white head that provides significant lacing. Ultra pale malt indeed. The nose is rife with dank citrus aromas, including mango, grapefruit, and passion fruit. Very nice and indeed more “amped up” than Data Set #1.

The taste is led by all that dank citrus, especially the delicious mango and the passion fruit, but there’s also a significant sweet oat flavor that provides balance. I could drink this until it came out my ears.

A full, soft mouthfeel is expected and delivered. This is really well done in the vein of Tree House’s iconic beers."
2814,Roguer,Data Set #2,4.23,"Strong head production and good retention.

Very strong fruity notes, in particular stone fruit, guava, pineapple, and mango. Minor dankness and some bright green herb and pine notes. Definitely a stronger overall impression on the nose than #1 (and much greener), but not explosive.

Similar on the palate. It's a touch melange-ish and homogeneous at first, but those tropical notes really start to shine mid-sip, lasting through the back third. Tasting notes of mango, pineapple, very light dankness, parsley, vanilla, oregano, tangerine, papaya, berries, apple, pear. No guava or peach, so there's a small delta from the nose.

Semi-dry finish, which I don't recall from #1 or #4, but there is a lasting almost herb-like light leafy bitterness long after the sip.

This one sits pretty comfortably in the Data Set lineup. It is indeed more expressive than #1, with more expressive yeast esters, and perhaps even more phenols. It's less explosive than the thiolized yeast, both on the nose and palate."
2815,brewme,Data Set #2,4.25,"Picked-up a single can as part of a mixed four pack of this series for about twenty dollars. My three hundred and seventh brew from these guys. Canned on date of 3/10/23. Solid, not outstanding."
2816,John_M,Between Two Grahams,4.27,"On tap at the brewery taproom in Paso Robles. The beer pours a dark brown color with excellent head retention and lots of lacing all around. This beer looks great. On the nose I'm picking up milk chocolate, light bourbon, cherry and vanilla. The sum total is an interesting rich Graham cracker aroma. Impressive. The flavor profile replicates the nose in this sweet, somewhat boozy ba stout. The finish is a tad rough, but this is otherwise a pretty tasty ba impy stout. Mouthfeel is fairly full, with a long, sweet, boozy finish. The beer is a tad bit boozy on the finish, but that doesn't detract much from the beer's drinkability. 

Nice beer. Probably couldn't drink a whole lot of this, but it's a tasty ba stout overall."
2817,dafla67,Between Two Grahams,4.33,"Pours dark brown. Aroma is pure sweetness - vanilla dominates with cinnamon and chocolate. Taste follows nose - vanilla, cinnamon & chocolate. Mouthfeel is on the lighter side."
2818,Herbabee,Between Two Grahams,4.48,"ow, this one packs a wallop of flavor! poured into sampler snifter opaque pitch black with a frothy choc milkshake capper, receding down to a flank of dense bubbles around the fill line. Nose is predominantly cinnamon with some other bakery whiffs in play. Taste is massively spicy and sweet; cinnamon, vanilla, marshmallows and chocolate having a pillow fight on your taste buds! Almost like a chai, even. Swallow/finish is bittersweet, aromatic and with a slight booze burn. Not bad for what i assume to be a scratch edition."
2819,sjrider,Between Two Grahams,4.18,Bottle pour - deep dark brown with chocolate milk head leaving scattered lacing. Nose is cinnamon forward with chocolate and vanilla notes. Taste follows with roasty malt and a butt ton of cinnamon that lingers way past the finish. You best enjoy cinnamon on a grand scale to appreciate this one.
2820,haines710,Green Grunge,4.34,On tap at Pirates PNC Park. Pours a beautiful clear golden color. Smells like citrus. Taste is hoppy but not overly juicy. This is an old school IPA - not hazy. Tastes great. Awesome mouthfeel. Loved it like other IPAs from this brewer. This one hides the alcohol and tastes fantastic.
2821,dbl_delta,Green Grunge,4.08,"On tap at Sydney's in East Berlin PA. Pours a very slightly hazy medium gold with a brief off-white head. Initial impression is pine, citrus rind, tropical fruits, and maybe a hint of peach. Mouthfeel is smooth, and slightly on the light side of sticky. Overall, another pretty decent AIPA from Fat Heads."
2822,DavetotheB,Green Grunge,4.11,"From a 12oz can dated 3/20/23 into a pint glass.

Pours a translucent amber yellow with maybe one finger of white head. Average retention, light lacing.

Crack of the can gives some citrus peel and juice notes. A little warming lets loose some pine and marijuana.

Pretty strong tasting. Pine bitterness, citrus peel. resin, earth.

Body is just a touch on the thin side, but appropriate for the abv. Slight stickiness. Low carbonation. Bitter aftertaste.

Another winner for Fat Heads. Rarely a miss for these guys in the ""clear"" IPA realm."
2823,schoolboy,Green Grunge,3.93,"I'm not sure I get the name - the hops are fresh hops, I guess. That's fine. I loved gunge as a style just like I like lo-fi today.

This pours deep yellow and translucent with fine bubbles. The aroma is more like a hazy stench light - it stinks (and that's a good thing). The taste is dry and pungent. None of that juicy stuff here, just good old-fashioned hops blending nicely.

Recommended and commended. This brew is $2.22/can - an excellent value."
2824,NeilSilber1,14th Anniversary Golden Barleywine,4.7,Pours caramel red with a faint head on draught in tulip glass. Beautiful lacing and sweet caramel malty boozy notes and bourbon barrel barley wine punch at 14.9% ABV.
2825,mkh012,14th Anniversary Golden Barleywine,4.08,"Pours light golden brown with minimal off-white head. The nose is caramel, milk chocolate, cherry, and bourbon. Hints of orange peel, wood, and leather. The taste is similar. Cherry, bourbon, caramel, and subtle orange/peach. Fairly boozy with an abrupt finish. Low sweetness for the style (or at least not as luxurious/decadent as many). Medium mouthfeel. Pretty good but meh relative to Fremont's best."
2826,RaulMondesi,14th Anniversary Golden Barleywine,3.8,"On tap at Hollingshead in Orange, CA.

It’s golden, for sure. But are we talking Golden Showers or Golden Slumbers? Well, it’s nowhere near Slumbers. But I also don’t want to put it close to shower territory like that weird dude you dated in college. It’s just ok."
2827,Ozzylizard,14th Anniversary Golden Barleywine,4.11,"14th Anniversary Barrel-Aged Golden Barleywine Limited 2023 Release. Mystery Beer #1 from @muchloveforhops3 in BSBIF #1. Waxed and capped bomber. Reviewed 02/12/23 (Review 3184). Note that I use DD/MM/YY protocol.
Stored at 34 degrees at home. Served at 56.1 degrees F in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. The final temperature was 62.2 degrees F. 
Appearance – 4.
First pour – Medium Amber (SRM 12), hazy.
Body – Ruby Brown (SRM 24), opaque. Under direct light, same. When rear-lite, ruby amber and cloudy. At the final temperature, I checked the rear-lighting, and found it to be ruby and clear, so the previous haziness was probably chill haze.
Head: Average (Maximum 1.5 cm, aggressive center pour), beige, high density, somewhat fizzy, quickly dropping to a 0.1 to 0.15 cm crown and a thin partial cap.
Lacing – Poor, but considering the ABV, it’s surprising there is any.
Aroma – 4.25 – Sweet, caramelly, and a bit fruity. Maybe a hint of bourbon, or at least whiskey. No hops, no yeast, no alcohol (14.9 % ABV as stated on the bottle). 
Flavor – 4 – Begins slightly sweet and caramel but not sticky. No yeast, no hops. Unable to taste any vanilla, tannic acid, char, or any other bourbon barrel flavors. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl. Moderate gastric warming.
Palate – 4 – Full; creamy; soft carbonation.
Final impression and summation: 4.25 Pretty distinctly a barleywine, slightly sweet and well-hidden ethanol. The barrel aging doesn’t show up well in this young bottle – too bad I don’t have a few to lay back."
2828,dafla67,14th Anniversary Golden Barleywine,4.49,"Pours a dark amber, slightly brownish color. Aroma is a nice sweetness of caramel, dark fruitiness and bourbon. Taste follows nose sweetness with the caramel, dark fruit, bourbon with the addition of brown sugar. Full mouthfeel. Wonderful barleywine."
2829,drdiesel9483,14th Anniversary Golden Barleywine,4.49,"Look - amber color, with an off white head and rimming. I wouldn't say it looks like a blond but my guess is that the barrel changed the color
Smell and Taste - Carame toffee and booze, just fantastic!
Feel - full body medium fizz carb
Overall - Just fantastic!!!"
2830,John_M,14th Anniversary Golden Barleywine,3.97,"On tap at the Taps Beer Reserve today. Very surprised to see this on tap here.

The beer pours a fairly dark amber color with decent head retention and light lacing. This is a beer that has that ""aged for a while in barrels"" look to it. Surprisingly, I'm not getting a lot on the nose. Just some light vanilla, fig and brown sugar. It's not bad, but I wish there was more of it. On the palate, this is a very sweet beer, even for a barleywine. The vanilla and sweet date flavor really seem to dominate in this beer. I'm not really getting a huge amount of barrel character. Mouthfeel is fairly full, with a long, sweet finish. Abv is pretty well integrated into the flavor profile, though obviously this is a big beer with noticable alcohol.

Interesting beer. It's impressive, though I'm not sure an August release makes a lot of sense with a ber like this. I think this is a beer that will likely improve over time. Right now, it's a good beer, but isn't a great barleywine, and probably isn't something I'll order again any time soon."
2831,WunderLlama,Encoded,4.29,"Brewers notes:Keeping an eye toward creative possibilities with Peacharine, the aroma is a stunning display of hop saturation. Juicy peach, ripe stone fruit, and zesty citrus notes are complemented by overripe pineapple, mango nectar, and grapefruit. Supremely soft and palate-coating with low bitterness, Encoded holds no secrets to blissful drinkability. 

Can poured into a pretentious beer glass, massive four finger foam on the pour over a hazy yellow orange liquid

Seriously pours out thick guava juice, guava colored and thick soupy like, a bit of a fizzy head forms before fading quickly, about as opaque as you can get

Nose basically guava up front, thick guava juice, some passion fruit and pineapple, citrus, orange juice and mango puree, no beer at all in there, it's just fruit juice

Taste again is just fruit puree, loads of passion fruit and guava up front, into some mango and orange citrus like, a bit of tartness, some creamy notes but otherwise again no beer at all!

Mouth is thick chewy puree like

Overall this is not beer in the slightest, why even call this a beer, it's just a fruit smoothie with alcohol, I baffled how this can still be called a beer. Is it tasty? Yes. Smells nice sure. But NOT A BEER, especially Berliner Weisse!"
2837,Kgoldsbe,Thrice The Daily Serving,4.68,"This is a thick, incredibly juicy Berliner Weiss that is delicious. Warning: this does not taste like beer. It tastes like guava, mango, passion fruit, pineapple and lime juice mix. Its abv is a dangerous 8% so be careful. I am a fan."

Nose starts with some barnyard farmhouse saison like funk, yeasty, earthy funk, some dark sweet malt caramelized sugar notes and hint of roast, very faint fruity wine and port with some chocolate after, a bit of oak and more port notes as it warms

Taste brings more barnyard farmhouse Brett saison funk, earthy Brett funk bordering a cheese funk, some dark malt notes, a bit of caramelized turbinado sugar like character, hint of chocolate, then plenty of fruity wine characters, no specific wine just like a fruity red wine, with a hint of port and oak on the back end, finishes a little sweet and sticky, but dries a bit as well

Mouth is med to a bit fuller bod, med carb

Overall not usually a fan of dark funky beers, this was pretty good though, still not one I would reach for"
2840,Tsar_Riga,Head Hunter Simply Simcoe,4.17,"A - Pours out a clear, orange body, short white head that fades to a thin cap, some small bubble lacing scattered across the glass.

S - A mixture of orange and grapefruit flesh and pith with a pine and grass hop hit, with peppery spiciness as a highlight.

T - The grass and pine ratchets down, with the citrus coming forward in the open. Some cracker malt presents in the middle, with a dry bite of pith and earthiness in the finish.

M - Brisk carbonation and moderate weight, a very dry close, and a lingering chewy resin aspect that builds over time.

O - A solid variation on the original, but not an improvement on that. Enjoyable, but the resin build means this is one-and-done. Tasty nevertheless."
2841,Radome,Head Hunter Simply Simcoe,4.35,"Poured from a 12 oz can into a red wine glass. 

L - Medium gold color with great clarity. Thick, rocky, resilient off-white head is truly impressive.

S - Delicious, hop-forward aroma is a blend of citrus and herbal notes. Grapefruit, mandarin orange, mown grass and light mint; all fresh and inviting. Just the faintest malt in the background and no yeast character.

T - The flavors have more of a balance between malt and hops than the aromas did. The malt hits first, with sweet bread like Hawaiian dinner rolls, but it is almost instantaneously overshadowed by citrus from the hops. Lemon and tangerine notes with a lightly herbal character as well, but somehow soft instead of harsh.

F - Light to medium body with a slight mouth-coating sweetness after the swallow. Moderate to high carbonation feels creamy. Strong to very strong hops bitterness. Warming alcohol.

O - This is a delicious showcase for the Simcoe hops, yielding a bright, fresh and yummy beer."

2852,MutuelsMark,Sap Moss,4.13,"Saved the highest ABV of the West Coast IPA box for last and it did not disappoint. While it isn't the best in of the box, it is the highest ABV. Color, head and nose are all the typical IPA variants. Taste is hard to describe, not sure what flavor jumps out. Isnt the normal piney flavor. Not much bitterness, unfortunately. Still a good beer!"
2853,NickSMpls,Sap Moss,3.95,"Canned 5/25. Clean pour, bit of haze. For a DWCIPA, the aroma profile is very muted. We get a whiff of citrus, not much else. Taste is hop with a definite citrus taste, followed up with more stone fruit and a herbal / grain finish. The 8.0 % ABV is well concealed, so watch out."
2854,dbrauneis,Sap Moss,4.15,"A: Pours a clear medium golden yellow in color with moderate amounts of active visible carbonation rising quickly from the bottom of the glass and moderate apricot + peach + bright yellow colored highlights. The beer has a three finger tall dense foamy bright white head that reduces to a large patch of slightly mottled medium thick film covering the entire surface of the beer and a thin ring at the edges of the glass. Moderate amounts of lacing are observed.

S: Moderate to strong aromas of citrus/grapefruit + citrus/grapefruit pith + herbal + grassy hops over the top of light to moderate aromas of bready + biscuit + pale malts with a light amount of sugary sweetness.

T: Upfront there are light to moderate flavors of bready + biscuit + pale malts with a light amount of sugary sweetness. That is followed by moderate to strong flavors of citrus/grapefruit + citrus/grapefruit pith + herbal + grassy hops which impart a light to moderate amount of aggressive lingering bitterness.

M: Light to medium bodied with moderate amounts of carbonation. Slightly crisp initially with a hint of dryness in the finish.

O: Easy to drink with well hidden alcohol and a pleasantly crisp + dry mouthfeel. Refreshing and enjoyable with a more classic C-hop West Coast hop profile. I could easily have a few of these."

2856,ovaltine,Sap Moss,4.35,"Pours a beautiful unfiltered golden straw color with a sudsy white head that provides little to no lacing, which is a bit surprising. Very nice dank citrus notes (oranges and grapefruit) and a bit of pine as well. 

The taste is led by a very juicy orange flavor, which is delightful, and there’s a nice grapefruit flavor as well, with some pine and some bitterness at the back of the palate, especially as the beer warms (which is key with this beer - allowing it to warm a bit).

There’s no discernible alcohol other than a slight warming at the back of the palate, which is pretty incredible given the 8% ABV. The mouthfeel is full and dry, commensurate with the style. Excellent stuff here by Hop Butcher, IMHO."
2857,ZebulonXZogg,Seventeen,3.58,"Pours a foggy reddish brown, khaki head and a spot of lacing. Nose says orange, and booze, taste buds agree and get some fruit dark fruit. Full bodied, well carbonated. Flavors just didn't work for me."
2858,vette2006c5r,Seventeen,4.21,"Seventeen pours a dark brown color with a small, lacing head. The aroma is sweet, with bitters, orange liqueur, and vermouth hints.

Taste: Herbaceous orange and kumquat, from the outset, with caramel and raisin tones underneath; assertive and boozy, with a medicinally bitter finish

Mouthfeel: Medium to full body with moderate to high carbonation; wamth in the gullet

Overall: I have enjoyed some beer ""cocktails"" but this one is just not that drinkable; I have never before heard of a Boulevardier so I don't have a basis for comparison - maybe this hit the mark but I guess that cocktail is not for me"

Bourbon and booze. Oak. Kind of old fashioned vibe with the orange liqueur barrels. Definitely tastes like a cocktail. Caramel, toffee, dark dried fruits."

Appearance: Dark amber, good head.

Smell: Strong barrel nose, lots of vanilla.

Taste: Moderately sweet, fruity, woody, orange flavor stays in the background. Not overly heavy for 11+% abv.

Overall: A little short review since I was at a friend's house and splitting this can. The Surly anniversary beers are almost always too strange to live and too weird to die. I've never had a boulevardier cocktail so I don't know how close they got to approximating it. It's worth a try but a one and done."
2862,DarkLordScott,Seventeen,4.19,"Pours a bronze or cola colored brew that has a small glaze of head on it. Aroma is raisins, caramel, bourbon and orange for a most unusual profile. Taste is lighter than expected, with flavors hitting in this order -- light caramel, bourbon and orange. A most unique flavor. All are presented in the strong ale package which works well."
2863,zeff80,Seventeen,4.16,"16oz can. Poured out a clear, golden orange color with a small, off-white head of foam. It left thin rings of lace on the glass. It smelled of orange bitters, caramel, toffee and boozy heat. Sweet toffee and caramel taste with orange bitters."
2864,Victory_Sabre1973,Seventeen,4.33,"From a 16oz can. 

This is a darker pouring beer. It looks cola like when pouring. When I hold it to the light it's an extremely dark amber color, and it looks fairly clear. The head that forms is quite thick at 3 finger. The color of the head is a light tan color. The head retention overall is great, and there's some nice lacing on the glass as it dissipates. 
The nose is quite layered. I get some orange. I get notes of bourbon barrel oak. I get some raisin in the mix, as well as some molasses. Quite pleasing mix. 
The flavor is quite interesting, though I'll really have a tough time describing it. There's a good amount of orange in the flavor. I get some raisin, and molasses. The bourbon barrel oak really stands out to me. I get some vanilla and caramel to top it all off. There's also a decent, but not overpowering bitterness in the mix also on the finish. 
The body is decent and full. There's a good, yet smooth, burn going on here. 
While I'm not sure it's for me, I do know this is a very well constructed beer. The flavors work together. Very interesting indeed."

Pours coal brown with a 2+ finger light-brown head that left great lacing. Aroma is orange, roast malt, bourbon, and a hint of moleasses. Taste follows, slightly sweet, equally bitter. Decent mouthfeel, overall excellent."
2868,jlindros,Kettle Mettle,3.88,"Canned 2023/10/03
Pours a creamy frothy 1 finger head with good retention, fair lacing, hazy cloudy pale orange color

Nose brings tropical fruit, mango, some citrus, a touch of peachy stone fruit, a bit of sweet malt and more doughy creamy flaked proteins, little grassy hop touch

Taste starts with some tart grapefruit like character, quickly into tropical fruit, some peachy stone fruit, generic tropical with a mango papaya banana smoothie kinda thing, some bitter citrus rind and pith, some sweet doughy malt and hint of cereal, flaked proteins, finishes with a touch of smooth alcohol, spicy green hops kicking in but not overbearing

Mouth is med to fuller bod, a little soft juicy, med frothy carb, light warming alcohol

Overall pretty good, at least the base beer exists here and you can get the fruits from the hops themselves, a bit green spicy hop late from all the dry hops, not one of their best, but decent"
2869,Damian,Kettle Mettle,4.28,"Drank from a 1 pint can purchased at Trillium Brewing Company, Boston, MA
10/03/23
Served in a tulip

The beer poured a cloudy, bright straw yellow and was topped by a half-inch tall cap of bone white froth. The head fell to lasting swirls atop the liquid. Some streaky lacing stuck along the glass.

The aroma was solid but pretty straightforward. Citrus notes dominated. Orange peel was most apparent. Bit of sweetness. Hint of dankness too. As the beer sat, some lemon came forth as well.

The flavor profile was also dominated by citrus. Orange notes came through strongest up front. Juicy orange flesh perhaps, along with a bit of rind-like pith. Moderately sweet. Tart lemony notes appeared in the center. Loads of grapefruit on the back end. The grapefruit turned more pithy on the finish. Some bitterness lingered after the swallow.

Excellent rich, soft, creamy mouthfeel. Medium-full bodied for the style. The liquid contained a fine, moderate effervescence that fluffed up nicely on the palate.

Kettle Mettle is a flavorful, citrus-forward IPA, but it lacked complexity and uniqueness. All in all, a solid collaboration between Trillium and Vitamin Sea but nothing to write home about."
2870,jzeilinger,Keystone State Of Mind,4.16,"Canned on: ??????

A - Medium orange, tan, gold opaque color with dense, creamy white lacing,.

S - Dank peach and tropical fruit dominate the nose.

T - Peach and tropical fruit from start to finish and ends on the sweet side with very little bitterness.

M - Big medium body that's chewy and pillowy soft.

O - Definitely rock solid and worth a look."
2871,mvanaskie13,Keystone State Of Mind,3.99,"Poured into a wide mouth grip shaped goblet: color is straw gold, hazy/murky/dense looking, head is off white with fine bubbles and presents 1/4 inch thick, head dissipates to thin top with no lacing 

Smell is mixed tropicals, candied fruit, light pilsner and bread like malt notes, slight onion from simcoe.

Taste is more mixed tropicals, candied fruit, mixed grain flavor of pilsner/oats/wheat with light bread/biscuit notes, hint of onion from simcoe; abv is hidden well with limited booziness. 

Mouthfeel is low carbonation, moderate sweetness, low/moderate bitterness - more bitterness and balance than most NT NEIPAs. 

Overall an above average NT NEIPA with a more prominent aroma and bitter backing."
2872,philbe311,Keystone State Of Mind,4.27,"Two plus fingers of fluffy light khaki colored froth with a slightly rocky top... Rock solid retention... Color is a vibrant hazed medium gold with some orangish undertones... Beautiful nose of mango, orange and oats... Really inviting and somewhat intoxicating... Palate is exactly as expected... Hops presence intensifies a bit towards the end... On the fuller side of medium bodied... Lush and somewhat fluffy... Brisk carbonation... Slightly chalky finish... Nice all around brew from two of my favorite breweries... Nothing to complain about here..."
2873,JohnniEMc,Keystone State Of Mind,4.33,"In the clear glass liter mug, it looks like a carbonated unfiltered lemonade. Maybe it's just a shade darker. There's a modest off-white head, but the emptied contents of the pint can produced no extraneous foam. The head seems to be enduring. Tropical fruit is a good reference for its aroma, maybe pineapple, maybe mango, but definitely not sharply hoppy. The taste is almost amazingly soft, almost because this brewery continues to produce some of the best Imperial hazies outside of New England and maybe even including many there. There's a little more piney bite to the hopping, but it's appreciated as a counterbalance to the soft starch backbone. The mouthfeel is fine in texture and only a little alcohol bite comes through ina negative way. Come on, now, it rings in a 8.7% ABV. This brewery makes so many of these, with various labels, that it's hard to keep track. They're almost all excellent, as is this one."

M - Medium body, with a sweet thread thats omnipresent, without offending, nice linger
O - A very good offering, with excellent flavor"
2876,jonphisher,Maple & Whiskey Barrel-Aged Stout,3.93,"Pours a very deep dark brown, nice head considering barrel and abv; light brown settles to a nice film, swirling brings it right back, crystal clear when backlit. 

Nose is light maple, some char, oak tannin heavy bourbon, nice chocolatey coffee presence as it warms. 

The taste is first bourbon, again very oaky; followed by a pleasantly light and balanced maple presence; after which comes a distinct hit of coffee, rich in flavor strong black medium roast, just how I love to drink it, again, little bit of chocolate…the aftertaste is wonderfully balanced mix of dark malt and light maple. 

Medium body, on the lighter side; medium to low carb, no heat or burn but there does come some sinus clearing and throat warming from the bourbon on the finish…as it goes down there is a little hint of bitter roast; very easy to drink, a light residual maple presence lingers on the tongue and lips."
2877,ryan1788a5,Maple & Whiskey Barrel-Aged Stout,4.1,"12oz bottle poured into a snifter.

A: Very dark mahogany brown- as close to black as it gets. Khaki-colored head rises to a solid inch and settles after a while. Thin, broken rings of lacing.

S: Rich and sugary notes up front. Maple sugar candy and brown sugar. Figgy and almost candi sugar-esque as the malt aromas begin to blend. Blackstrap molasses and whispers of dark fudge sauce. Whiffs of blackberry syrup and concord grape. Very faint and subtle rye whiskey, with very subdued woody barrel notes that can very easily be missed if one does not know to look for them. 

T: In taste it is a whole different ball game. Big flavors of tootsie roll and chocolate caramel chews up front. A dose of leathery/jerky notes. Smoke and medium roast coffee beans. Maple syrup is quite prominent and focal on the mid-palate. Those candi sugar-like and figgy/blackberry notes come into focus sharply but briefly, and then give way to a rye-focused whiskey barrel with golden raisins in tow. The finish is all wood and Canadian rye with a fat chewy caramel note and some brown cocoa powder lingering. 

M: Full and chewy in the mouth. Plenty of residual sugars that have a mild coating effect, but stop short of being sticky. Carbonation is more than adequate, and adds a bit of lift and a slight prickling sensation at the tip of the tongue. Bit of carbonic bite. Just the softest expression of wood tannin. Just a hint of syrupy lip stickiness. 

O: This is one of those beers that I think will be overlooked by the uber geek crowd, but it's solid for what it is and stands out for being different. The Whistlepig barrel is unique, but softer and more rye-focused; certainly not as brawny and bold as bourbon would be. The maple flavor is more nuanced with more of a raw feel rather than being straight maple syrup. In body and mouthfeel it is great in its balance and not too sticky but not dry. It does feel very ""Vermont,"" and reminds me of how Lawson's incorporates maple into its brews. Maybe not earth-shattering and attention grabbing, but quietly confident and great in its own right. Well worth a drink."
2878,micada,Maple & Whiskey Barrel-Aged Stout,4.14,"Not bad for what I think is an early barrel aged venture from Long Trail / Harpoon / Whistle Pig…whatever the ownership structure is. Poured cool to a small snifter. Color is a dark sienna (YMMV). Tight tiny cell mocha head burns away quickly. Leaves some spotty islands on the side, but otherwise a clean glass. Aroma is pleasant light maple and stronger Whistle Pig whiskey. The first sip is a little disappointing, mostly because of my expected tastes. It starts less sweet than I imagined, and has a strong bitter finish. The actual stout foundation is solid: dark, clean, no strange flavors. After it aerates a bit, the bitterness is fading, opening up more barrel tannin traits, which works better for the overall taste profile. I am good with a sweeter stout as much as a drier stout, so Inwouldnt mind a smidge more maple flavor. It’s there toward the back, if you focus on finding it. Alcohol doesn’t bite, and has subtle warming. It’s worth trying. I get the impression aging won’t help it, so fresh is probably best. Be sure to let it breathe a few minutes before you jump into it."
2879,malrubius,Maple & Whiskey Barrel-Aged Stout,4.53,Bottle. Near black with ring. Boozy molasses maple syrup and wood smoke aroma. Sweet per style but the whisky and the herbal woodiness clean it all up. Full body slick low carbo per style. Excellent.
2880,bobv,Maple & Whiskey Barrel-Aged Stout,4.3,"12 ounce bottle packaged 10/25/23.

Moderate pour yields a 1/2 inch light tan head over a near black body with lacing.

Nose of roasted malt, chocolate malt, maple, and slight whiskey. 
As it warms the whiskey aromas come forward.

Taste is maple and chocolate with whiskey.
As it warms all the flavors become more pronounced.

Mouthfeel is thinner than I had hoped with light to medium carbonation.

Overall, a pretty nice example of the style and would recommend giving it a try.
Cheers!"
2881,chinchill,Praline,4.27,"12 oz can from Michigan with a 29 December 2023 canning date stamped on the bottom edge. 

Appearance. Near black and opaque body with a good beige head. 

This has a wonderful aroma, showcasing roasted hazelnuts. The high ABV is hidden here, and well hidden in the feel and flavor as well. It is more bitter and hoppy than I expected; perhaps a bit more hoppy than I'd prefer. Nonetheless, the flavor seems on target. 

Overall. Excellent as a hazelnut ale and as an Imperial porter."
2882,MikeWard,Praline,3.89,"12oz can into a pint glass. Canned 12/29/22, so closing in on a year old.

Nice look to this one. Very dark brown body with a small tan head leaving excellent lacing. Aroma is creamy chocolate with a hint of hazelnut. The hazelnut is not as noticeable in the taste. Quite creamy with a light roast in the finish."
2883,Rug,Praline,4.28,"Canned 1/3/23

Moving right along with the BIF beers rhat BigIronH sent me, we have a hazelnut Imperial Porter. I’m a sucker for hazelnut in a beer but nine times out of ten it’s in an Imperial Stout, and I’m fairly certain this is the first Porter of any substyle with hazelnut that I’ve had. Let’s crack it open and see what’s going on

Pours a very dark brown with 2 fingers of creamy light tan head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing

The nose has a very authentic nuttiness thst I really dig. I’m picking up on aromas of hazelnut butter, milk chocolate, roasted peanut, brown sugar, raisin, vanilla bean, light roast coffee, and burnt caramel

It’s quite similar in taste and very well done. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting milk chocolate, roasted hazelnut, vanilla bean, peanut butter, dark toast, caramel, brown sugar, and raisin. The swallow brings notes of hazelnut butter, dark toast, medium roast coffee, milk chocolate, brown sugar, toasted walnut, and brown sugar

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a crisp beer. Finishes mostly dry and nicely balanced

Hazelnut strikes again. And Odd Side unsurprisingly"

2887,Brutaltruth,Blended With Lumber #1,4.34,"From the 12 oz bottle in a snifter. This monster imperial pours a 
slick coal black with a modest head of brown foam that settles to a 
thin ring, faint dusty layer, and shows some light legs. Nose of 
bourbon, oak, vanilla, dark chocolate, and dark roasted malts.
Flavors hit the mark with dark chocolate fudge, oak, bourbon, 
rich vanilla, moderate char, and dark berry nuances.
Mouth feel is full, smooth, moderately slick, subtle 
carbonation, lightly warming, and finishing with a 
sweet bitter malt note.

on the sweetness spectrum.

2888,Beersnake,Blended With Lumber #1,4.44,"Poured at fridge temp. Pours motor oil black, with a motor oil consistency! Nice light brown head. The nose screams vanilla. Also picking up notes of chocolate, slight walnut, and a touch of roasted malts. 

The taste is really good. I was expecting a one-dimensional taste of vanilla after smelling it, but this is most definitely not. A lot going on. Vanilla, burnt caramel, brown sugar, roasted malts, some dark-roasted coffee, slight pipe tobacco, and some really smooth dark fruit. Bourbon is definitely there as well, providing a nice boozy taste. Really good, with a thick mouthfeel!"

S: Herbal pine, citrus zest, blueberry, tropical and stone fruit, a touch grassy, biscuity bready malt, and a nice dry finish.

T: Resinous pine, citrus zest, lemon, lime, tangelo, and grapefruit, underlying tropical and stone fruit slowly emerges, very noticeable blueberry from the Mosaic, plus some passion fruit, guava, peach, apricot, and mango, biscuity bready malt, and a dry finish.

O: Exactly what you'd expect from a Pizza Port seasonal. Proper Westy that really shows off what the hops they chose bring to the table."
2893,TheWaySheGoes,Joys of Summer,3.8,"Creamy heady, earthy, lemongrass, and peachy tastes notes. Decent hint of malt, no booziness whatsoever. Mouthfeel is where this one is let down. What started off strong was let down by the watery finish. Fresh can, and brought up due to the price point and six can tall boy selling point."
2894,BodhiTree,Joys of Summer,4.64,Great ipa for summer or any time. I am a big fan of swami by pizza port and this is an obvious sister but with its own lovely characteristics. Will review with more detail later. Sláinte!
2895,MaltAndHopsFC,Joys of Summer,4.51,"A textbook West Coast IPA. Poured straight down the middle into a Teku glass it produced a fluffy 2 finger head that lingered throughout the tasting. 

This looks like a San Diego IPA. Pale gold with just the right amount of chill haze.

Aroma bursting with citrus upfront and subtle hints of fresh berries on the back end. 

Taste is a nice mix of tropical flavors and stone fruits. 

Feels good, not too heavy on the palate. 7% abv seems to be where WC IPAs find the most balance in terms of taste and mouthfeel.

Will buy again."
2896,BillAfromSoCal,Joys of Summer,4.03,"A nice looking beer. Slight chill haze. Tall, Fluffy white tight head of good duration. Lacing. Not a lot of smell, but a nice balance of hoppy bitterness, citrus, and some other nondescript/ unidentifiable flavors; perhaps a bit of pine. Medium body, clean finish. Very drinkable although just enough bitterness that I would probably prefer this one with food. A Nicely balanced WC IPA, that is a nice twist or change from more overtly fruity hazies, without being over the top bitter, although some bitterness is there."
2897,barndweller,Joys of Summer,4.59,"bought a sixer at room temperature cans from the shelf at trader Joe's, date on can 17 days ago. took it home, got it cold, and was delighted after I poured it into a tall glass. excellent example of my favorite style of beer... it's what I would expect from Pizza Port."
2898,RaulMondesi,Joys of Summer,4,"For the most part, things are ok. And I’m ok. But… maybe for some reason I want a bit more. Like Snap and Crackle without Pop, or the Beatles without George (obvi Ringo doesn’t matter), there is goodness here - but something feels incomplete. It’s good. Damn good. But because we are talking PP, maybe I just wanted full glory."

2900,Radome,Tropical Thunder Head Hunter,4.14,"Poured from a 12 oz can.

Outstanding appearance for an IPA, with very slight haze in a straw-colored beer and piles of fluffy head and lace. Strong aromas are all about the hops: grapefruit, guava and tangerine. Flavors are hop forward as well, but tend to grapefruit and orange, without much tropical fruit, and don't have much depth. Medium to light body with off-dry finish, sharp hops bitterness, and low alcohol presence. This is a very nice West Coast IPA with some tropical character."
2901,Tsar_Riga,Tropical Thunder Head Hunter,4.33,"A - Slightly hazy, but still mostly transparent orange body, a white head that fades to a thin cap, with extensive lacing.

S - Tropical fruit, mango primarily, but also pineapple, and stone fruit, peach mostly.

T - Super bright fruit open, then some malt based sweetness, that fades to a pithy bitter finish.

M - Moderate weight and sharp carbonation, followed by a lingering resin build.

O - Perhaps my favorite Head Hunter so far, with these least punishing bitterness, and fullest fruit notes. The result is drinkable and delicious."
2902,GOBLIN,Tropical Thunder Head Hunter,4.18,It's a nice variation on the original Head Hunter. I'd put this somewhere between original Head Hunter and Jungle Juiced Head Hunter. It keeps the enjoyable bitterness with a kick of Tangerine.
2903,Fordcoyote15,Tropical Thunder Head Hunter,4.14,"Less clarity than normal HH.

Smell doesn't have a strong pine aroma of HH but instead its all tangerine.

Taste is all tangerine too. Fortunately this isn't all new England'd up and doesn't taste like acid and lactose. Just a toned down ipa with lots of tangerine."
2904,Blogjackets,Tropical Thunder Head Hunter,4.3,"Poured from a twelve ounce can, the body is a clear yellow with good fluffy white head. Excellent lacing throughout the tasting.

Aroma of wonderful pear, peach and pineapple (thanks to el dorado hops) along with a typical Head Hunter earthy hop aroma.

Taste follows nose but the flavors a muted compared to the nose. Arising is the expected bitterness: strong but controlled.

Mouthfeel is good. Soft and good carbonation."

2907,1BrewBacca,Dragon's Milk - Crimson Keep,3.85,Looks like the quintessential Red Ale. Could use more froth on the head. Notes of bourbon maltiness. Little to sweet for my taste buds. It's a good brew but not quite my style.

Taste: It has caramel toast bread crust flavors. There are some dark fruits with some dark cherry notes. There are some bourbon notes blended in with the other flavors. 

Feel: It has a full body with strong alcohol warming. 

Overall, the combination of flavors is complex and complimentary without any one element overpowering another."
2910,JamarcusMarinovich,Dragon's Milk - Crimson Keep,4.07,"Poured from bottle to pint glass. Deep copper brown/red color with thin, wispy head. Light bourbon on the nose, much more in the taste. Dark malt and some hints of dark fruit of some sort, not cherry. Oak comes through but not overpowering, same with alcohol. Warm but not burning for 11%. A nice cold evening beverage."
2911,Darkmagus82,Dragon's Milk - Crimson Keep,4.07,"Poured from a bottle into a snifter 
Appearance – The beer pours a brownish amber red color with a small head of off white foam. The head has a modest level of retention, fading over time and leaving a touch of sticky foamy lace on the sides of the glass. 
Smell – The aroma is heavy of a bready and caramel smell mixed with a whole lot of dark fruits of cherry, plum, and prune. Along with these smells comes big aromas of dough and a lightly toasted brown bread smell. Other sweet notes of toffee and brown sugar and a touch of candied sugar are in there as well, adding a nice dimension to the sweetness. Some light hop notes of a herbal and earthy nature pair well with a oaky and bourbon smell, to produce a rather malty and rich smell overall.
Taste – The taste begins with a big bready and thick, lightly toasted malt taste that has notes of a biscuit malt and some light doughy notes. At the same time, there is some sweetness of the dark fruits that were in the nose, as well as come caramelized sugar and a brown sugar and toffee flavor. Some light herbal and earthy hops are present upfront, with both getting a touch stronger at the expense of some of the sweet. As the taste advances the oak and bourbon become more pronounced, all while some mustiness and grain join in. Toward the very end the alcohol, peeks onto the scene, al while the sweet amps up a bit, in the end, leaving one with a moderately sweet, but somewhat smooth (for a 11 % abv brew) taste to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is medium in thickness and chewiness for a 11 % abv. beer with a carbonation level that is quite low. For the style and the tastes, the feel is quite nice making a rather slow but enjoyable sipper.
Overall – A rather big brew, being a mix of barleywine and red ale. A rather fun one to try."
2912,vickersspitfire,Dragon's Milk - Crimson Keep,4.18,"This poured out a very sexy and light amber color and was topped off with a nice semi thick tan head that eventually created a few islands and a nice thin ring around the glass. The aroma is sweet and estery with mild sweet smells mixed in with some very definite bourbon barrel wood. The taste is spot on, sweet overall with some strong esters and a bourbon flavor that is not over powering. It is medium bodied with mild carbonation and leaves you longing for that ""just one more sip"" feeling. Very smooth on the palate, it almost reminds me of sweet potatoes and brown sugar. Very good beer over all."
2913,chinchill,Dragon's Milk - Crimson Keep,4.12,"12 oz bottle from a 4 pack served in a Belgian snifter. The bottling date, 6 June 2023, is stamped on the neck. I had another bottle from this 6 pack 3-4 months ago and it seems to have improved with age. It's not great looking, what with a murky brown body and a weak beige head.

Nice looking beer, reddish amber with a surprisingly persistent white head. Only specks of lacing though. Aroma is quite boozy with a light oak note. On tasting, sweet, bourbon, a little Wood. Finish is pleasantly warming. Seems to drink less than 11%, but also comes off less than it should be."

Beer was served orange with a nice white head.

Nose was great, full of tropical and citrus fruits.

Taste was a big thick malt base that displayed orange, grapefruit, and mango hopping. Finished with an alcohol kick on the back end. Hopping was well done; 7/10 on my bitterness scale.

Mouthfeel was medium to heavy bodied and pretty smooth.

Overall very reminiscent of Bell's Double Two Hearted, Hop Slam, and Sierra Hoptimum. Just a flavorful but boozy old school DIPA."

Overall - Jai Alai on steroids. Bigger and bolder tropical flavor and bitterness than the original. My only knock is it's a bit syrupy. Other than that it's pretty damn good. Would love to see Jai Alai Double IPA in the 8%-9% range with a thinner body. Pairs well with Free Bird by Lynyrd Skynyrd."
2920,clayrock81,Jai Alai Double IPA,4.03,"Poured a dark, copper body with two-finger head that stuck around awhile after leaving lace patches down the glass. Aroma has notes of piney dankness and grapefruit. Boozy beer, but not too much, a little piney and has that sticky, resiny feel at times, notes of citric and grapefruit hops are present. Basically tastes like regular jai alai except a little thicker and boozer, perhaps a little ""deeper"", as it seems not only a little stronger (with some heat on finish) but a little sharper in the hops and heavier/denser...if you like regular Jai Alai and like a ""classic"" IPA then this is one worth picking up."

T - Juicy tropical fruit up front and finishes with an assertive resiny pine bitterness on the back end.

M - Big medium body that's smooth and finishes semi-dry on the palate.

O - This is a fantastic beer worth seeking out."
2922,Scotchboy,Columbus Architect,4,"This is fun and old-school in my mind; clear and clean pilsner-looking pour shows ample carbonation and a good foamy head. Piney, resinous, herbaceous dank nose; melon and moderate West Coast bitterness on the palate."
2923,stevoj,Columbus Architect,4.11,"16oz can from Tavour. Clear golden pour, soft white head flattens out. Hoppy, piney aroma, light resinous notes. Taste brings light fruity notes, mango, pineapple. Oily feel with a sticky finish. Hoppy, layered. As usual, great job FG."
2924,StonedTrippin,Columbus Architect,4.2,"getting late in the wet hop season but im here til the end folks! picked this up last friday and cracked into it last night, a delicious beer, a cool expression of this hop, and one of the only beers ive seen to use columbus hops as a wet hop. this is really juicy and flavorful, fresh as can be, frothy and churned up feeling with some soft body, and packing just a little back end bitterness for balance, really pleasant stuff! bigtime fruity notes in this, and while i know columbus for grapefruit character, i also know it to be woodsy and piney and high alpha and dank, but thats not really how this presents, totally transformed in fresh hop form it seems, green melon and papaya, pink berry and clean lemon, and fleshy coconut come to mind, more floral than piney, very fresh and dripping with oily intensity. some weedy characteristics too though, a little pink bubblegum note, and some sweet tropical back end character, but nice bitterness in here, and its bold and intense the whole way without being green or vegetal as some of these wet hop beers are. a little something from the yeast in here is pleasant and compatible, there is enough grain supporting the hops, ever so slightly fuller in body, and the carbonation is steady, all the intangibles are here, and overall i love how different the columbus seems in this context. great beer, cool can art too! fort george is on a serious roll! you could put any hops in here and it would be great. collaboration with ghost town, who i do not know enough about..."
2925,NickSMpls,Columbus Architect,4.18,"Canned 9/2. Featuring Columbus Fresh Hops. Very pretty pour, bright and clear. A finger or so of frothy head provides light floral aromas. Taste is quite nice, a rather dry and light first sip finishes with a bracing bitterness with zero harshness. Flavor is subtle and uses the hop base to advantage. Very pleasant feel and modest 6.7% makes for a refreshing FH experience."
2926,woemad,Columbus Architect,4.39,"16oz can purchased at Community Pint, in Spokane, WA, for$5.50. Canned on

Poured into a teku, this was a clear golden amber color, with a good sized off-white head. Lots of lace.

Piney and grapefruity hop aroma. As expected, this is a WC style freshie.

Tastes like what was foretold in the nose, but deeper and danker. 

Medium bodied, with an oily, resiny mouth feel.

Old school, and very tasty. If this were on tap locally I'd probably have several."
2927,DefenCorps,Columbus Architect,3.92,"Can from Uptown Market 

A clear light orange with a dense, white head with good retention and lacing. The nose is solid. Fresh, zippy, clean, piney with an earthy fresh hop undertone. Dank, pine, old school. The palate opens moderately bitter with a dank, piney character, earthy and weed-like fresh hop character. The FH character is a really deep, wet, oily one here. Drying finish, bitter with pine. Minimal sweetness. Solid stuff."
2928,mfnmbvp,Gummylicious,4.03,"12 oz. can, canned 11/17/23, three week old IPA not so bad. Another New England DIPA from Noon Whistle, from the neighboring town of Lombard..

A: Certainly hazy.. pours an opaque orange juice color body, finger of soapy white froth. Lots of good spotty lacing. I'll be honest, it looks pretty deec.
S: It's actually got some good floral elements happening, some malty balance. Not overkill on the citrus fruit or acidity.
T: This is where it surprises me again - Again, juicy, fruity, hoppy, but also nice balance of bready biscuit malts (oats?). It definitely cuts the acidity of the beer, something which a lot of Hazies fail to do.
F: Super smooth, crisp, clean. Super light and easy-drinking stuff.

Overall, I was impressed, but then again, Noon Whistle puts out some pretty top-notch beer.

Noon Whistle Gummylicious -----4/5."
2929,mschrei,Gummylicious,4.43,"Surprised I never had/rated this before buying a six pack recently. Straw color, slight orange hues, lasting head and lacing.

These guys have had a great NEIPA program for years, and this one is no exception."

One complaint: A 'session' hazy in a 12 oz can. Why can't this be done for the big hitters? Why are we served Triple IPAs in pints? You have it backwards, Noon Whistle."
2932,TwilightBeerCareer,Gummylicious,4.1,"Pours a hazy yellow, with a white two finger head with some staying power. Tropical fruit aroma permeates from the glass.

Poured into a Tree House glass a pretty nice cloudy yellow/orange color, pretty nice carbonation, with a pretty nice thick/creamy one-finger plus white head, which also leaves some pretty nice creamy sticky lacing behind.

Hazy, pale gold colored body. Two fingers of white, fine bubble head, which reduces to a fluffy cap. Leaves behind rings and strings of lacing.
Aroma is very fruity - orange, guava, passion fruit, grapefruit, lime, green melon, and white grape.
Taste is dense with fruit flavors - orange, grapefruit, white grape, guava, green melon, pineapple, and lime. Moderately sweet, but earthy/herbal. Low bitterness. The white grape lingers late into the aftertaste.
Medium mouth feel, with a touch of nectar. Rapid quaffs lead to tongue numbness. Very good carbonation.
Bursts with tropical and citrus fruit flavors, which appear vibrant and not overly ripe."

A: Moderately hazy gold with 1-2 finger white frothy head with good retention and a fine film of lacing down the glass. 

S: Aroma is full of melon, white, grapefruit, orange, light, lime, and lemon grass in the finish. Esters are mild, and mostly floral and fruity.

T: Flavor is similarly fruity with green melon, white, grapefruit, tangerine, and guava. I don’t scent much of the passion fruit. Esters are mild -moderate and mostly fruity. Bitterness is low and alcohol is well hidden.

M: Feel is very smooth and has no rough edges. Body is medium at most with fine carbonation and a light dry finish.

O: POG Bubbles is a fine NEIPA with a green melon, heavy flavor, with accent of citrus and lately, herbal dank character in the finish."
2938,mvanaskie13,Double Replenish,3.93,"Poured into a narrow pint glass: color is copper, nearly transparent, some effervescence, head is light tan, presents with a solid top that is at least 1 finger thick and lingers well. Some spotty lacing. 

Smell is sweeter malt, light booziness, hops are earthy, citric, lighter pine; hops are not overpowering and the malt is subtle, more boozy sweetness. 

Taste is similar with with a sweet forward flavor but not overly malty, light ester alcohol, mixed hop notes of citrus, stone fruit, pine, some resinous notes. 

Mouthfeel is low/moderate carbonation (low for style), moderate sweetness, low/moderate bitterness, no real alcohol bite. 

Overall a great deviation for NT from the haze, but seeking more bitterness and emphatic hop notes from this."
2939,philbe311,Double Replenish,4.43,"Two fingers worth of late to develop lush light khaki colored froth comprised of big chunky bubbles... Rock star retention... Color is a vibrant pale bronze... Big juicy tropical fruit nose with some faint piney notes... Flavor profile leads with piney presence with a strong malt base and some faint tropical notes... On the fuller side of medium bodied... Ultra smooth... Even and consistent... Outstanding, sophisticated and very well rounded... I love this beer..."
2940,Antg8989,Double Replenish,4.76,"This is very good. Piney, candied grapefruit, sticky goodness. There is a slight hint of alcohol in the aroma, but at 9% it's no knock. Just looked at the can and this is marketed perfectly for true DIPA lovers"
2941,dbl_delta,Double Replenish,4.22,"Undated (WTF) can into pint glass. Pours a gorgeous deep amber-gold with a nice off-white head. Good lacing. Initial impression is pine resin, sticky citrus, and malt sweetness. Alcohol is extremely well hidden. Mouthfeel is medium and somewhat sticky. Finish fades to a slightly sweet pine resin. Overall, a very enjoyable West Coast DIPA. And the fact that they're donating a couple of bucks for tree replenishment is just icing on the cake."
2942,JohnniEMc,Double Replenish,4.44,"The original Replenish represented the West Coast IPA style very nicely. Could this be doubly good? The pour that emptied a pint can into a clear glass liter mug exposed a brew much like the original label. The color is a brilliant copper-amber that's almost amazingly transparent, with a proper slightly off-white head. The aroma seems to have a little more malt to it, but the standout character is the sharply piney hops. This tastes at least as remarkable as the first Replenish. There does seem to be a little more malt and with the additional alcohol, this is a bit sweeter, but never overly so. The hops are piney and bitter, but they don't dry out the finish quite like the less potent version. For the last comparison between the two, Replenish drinks like a WCIPA and Double Replenish like an excellent IIPA. Both are very well crafted, so personal taste will be all that matters. Once again, New Trail provides a delicious IPA with a high AVB that goes relatively unnoticed. The mouthfeel in this case is close to earning 4.75, considering the hop taste and ABV it delivers. The glass lacing isn't copious, but there's way more than from most beers that carry this ABV. This may not capture the West Coast style as well as the first version of Replenish, but this is one excellent Imperial IPA. It is fully flavored, balanced, rich and smooth, things that never hurt an IPA's reputation."
2943,jzeilinger,Double Replenish,4,"Canned on: ????????

A - Dark gold with perfect clarity and frothy bright white foam with moderate carbonation.

S - Resiny pine and sticky citrus, overall aroma is on the lighter side.

T - Pine, white grape, citrus, apricot, and leaves a resiny citrus and pine residue lingering on the palate that's nicely balanced on the finish with a slight bit of herbal character.

M - Medium body with gentle carbonation. 

O - Nice to see NT deviate from their usual hazey IPA's. This is solid."
2944,Roguer,Short Stack,4.27,"Fantastic head production, retention, and lacing. Vibrant orange hue to the opaque body. An absolutely gorgeous beer for the style.

Despite the additives, hops rule the day on the nose, albeit in a restrained, modest fashion. Notes of mango, grapefruit, bright herb, lemon, and blueberries (not enough to credit the added blueberry puree).

Wonderfully smooth on the palate; not quite as full bodied as their imperial strength IPAs, but very creamy, especially for the ABV.

On the palate, at first the Mosaic and the malt base take lead. It's not until about halfway through the sip that any maple syrup comes through, and even then, it's fairly restrained. Moderately sweet at best, a bit earthy and even pungent (likely due to the maple, blueberries, and the dankness expressed by the Mosaic all working in concert). Tasting notes include orange, lemon, mango, papaya. The blueberry puree doesn't really lend much in terms of discrete, obvious berry flavor, which is a surprise.

This is a fantastic, easy-drinking IPA, but in terms of what was implied and promised, I can't say it really executes the idea all that well. Perhaps that idea wouldn't taste as good as the final product actually came out."
2945,ovaltine,Short Stack,4.25,"Pours a hazy golden color with the ubiquitous creamy white head I associate with TH hazies. Beautiful beer. The nose features citrus notes, blueberries, and a touch of maple syrup.

The maple syrup is more pronounced on the taste, and works well with the blueberry and orange flavors, which intensify as the beer warms. There’s a lot going on here, but it all fits together very well.

The mouthfeel is medium and soft. Tree House did a really nice job with this, as expected."
2946,brewme,Short Stack,4.25,Picked-up a four-pack of cans at Tree House in Sandwich for about nineteen dollars. Canned on date of 3/17/23. My three hundred and fifteenth brew from these guys. Very good.
2947,57md,Short Stack,4.02,"This is a blueberry and maple syrup variant of Alter Ego, which itself is a variant of Julius.

I don't get any blueberry or maple notes in the nose, but they sure do come across in the flavor profile.

That said, I'm not sure that I'm buying into the idea of a ""breakfast IPA."" These adjunct flavors seem to me to be better suited for a stout base."
2948,tigg924,Short Stack,4.66,"Pours hazy, orange gold in color with one half inch head. Taste is maple syrup, white sugar, blueberry, and mango. Medium body, moderate carbonation, slightly bitter. Excellent ipa. Plenty of breakfast taste to go along with a base juicy beer. Original, would have liked to try this totally fresh but one week out, it is amazing."
2949,defunksta,Citragon DIPA,4.14,"Canned 5/18/23 (5 months ago)

Appearance: Pours a nearly completely hazy (10% clarity) medium to light orange color with a massive white head that lingers. SRM of 7-8. (4.25)

Aroma: Strong aromas of orange citrus, tropical pineapple, mango, lemon. Some tropical berries underneath.

Flavor: Strong flavors of orange citrus, tropical and ripe pineapple, grape and tropical melon. Some overly ripe tropical fruit and berries. Finishes juicy yet slightly sweet. Clean. 

Feel: Medium to heavier body, strong carbonation. Juicy get clean and drinkable.

Compared to EQ This Is Your Brain On Science 10/2023: Pours lighter , similar head. Similar aromas and flavors overall. Slightly less orange and tropical notes with dankness. More bright citrus and pineapple. Very similar. 

Overall: All sort of Citra in this one apparently. Still tons of citrus flavors with that classic mango skin flavor I get from EQ. Seems to sort of mask all of the other flavors that they describe above. (Rating: 4.14)"
2950,HattedClassic,Citragon DIPA,4.25,"The beer pours a nice white and creamy head that lasts for a long while and doesn't really fully go away. The beer itself is an opaque yellow with hints of a light orange.

The smell is pretty good. It has strong notes of tropical fruits such as a light pineapple, bitter dry hop notes, and a light grapefruit.

The taste is delicious. It has the same tropical notes as the smell but that the orange hops come forward and stay through the whole thing. The biggest difference is a sugar orange that comes out as it warms.

The feel is very good. It has a heavy body and light acidity. It has a tingling carbonation to it.

Overall, this is a really good collaboration between Dominion and Equilibrium and worth getting fresh if you can ."
2951,cjgiant,Citragon DIPA,4.06,"On tap:
Murky pale white peach with a stubborn foam head with large bubbles interspersed that doesn’t quite give a spongy impression. Nose hits with a very mild catty frankness, replaced by tangerine and a hint of lemon peel as it warms.

Medium bodied with a level of smoothness that matches its heft. Taste is a bit more dull to start, but opens as expected with warmth, especially with grapefruit pith bitterness. The bitterness drives this beer before it approaches cellar temps, when tangerine and nectarine join in. At this point, I start to get a mix of light pine and coconut mixed with an oat-like wrapper mid-late taste that tends to sweeten things up a bit, though the finish is still pithy bitter."

Smell is subdued but notes of lime, herbs, and feint wheat/toast. 

Taste is more citric/lime/berry than the typical NT pineapple/tropical/stone fruit; herbal/spiced note, lime/grapefruit, no booziness. 

Mouthfeel is low carbonation, moderate sweetness, low bitterness but a lingering sweetness and light alcohol drying on the tongue. 

Overall a citric forward but not overly sweet DHIPA as far as NT hazies go; got a bit thick/cloying with warmth but the boozy drying helps with that."

golden with a moderate head of white foam that settles to a thick ring, thin
layer, and displays some nice light lacing. Nose of candy malt, bubblegum, 
light banana, clove, lemon zest, light breaded malts, and white pepper. 
Flavors follow the nose but exceed in a fine presentation of candy sugar,
light clove, coriander, light banana, white pepper, subtle oak, light white 
grape, light breaded malts, orange zest, lemon zest, and spicy grassy hops
mingling with the phenol notes. Mouth feel is medium, medium light 
carbonation, smooth, and finishing lightly spicy and subtly dry.

Overall, a nice presentation of one of my favorite styles.

Cheers"
2967,Rug,Embrace Change,4.16,"Anchorage brewing a Tripel just seems to make sense given their approach to classic styles. It’s not often that a Tripel excites me, but I think this one will be an interesting take on the style. Let’s pop it open and find out if I’m right

Pours a cloudy deep gold with a finger of creamy off white head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing

The nose is definitely very bright as I was expecting, but it still retains the traditional estery notes associated with the style as well. I’m picking up on aromas of lemon zest, stone, banana runts, wildflower honey, earthy wheat, bready malt, wet hay, and light bubblegum

It’s not as sharp in taste, but there’s still a decent bite to it. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting bready malt, underripe banana, sweet honey, orange zest, wet hay, light grassy hops, and bubblegum. The swallow brings notes of doughy malt, earthy wheat, sweet honey, straw, black pepper, orange zest, and underripe banana

A medium body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a smooth beer. Finishes mostly dry and refreshing

This one is pretty damn good all around"

2971,GreesyFizeek,Flood Relief IPA,4.39,"Can purchased from the brewery. Great cause!

This one pours a slightly hazy golden yellow color, with a small head, and lots of lacing.

The aroma on this is much more reminiscent of something from the Alchemist than something from Hill Farmstead – zippy pine, fresh cut grass, marijuana, dense orange and grapefruit, and some peach.

I really enjoyed both of these beers, but it’s also definitely interesting how each individual version felt like the brewery putting on the costume of the other brewery. The Alchemist version was softer, subtler, and “juicier,” with the feeling of Shaun Hill taking a whack at brewing Heady Topper. While Hill Farmstead’s version felt like if Abner was brewed by the Alchemist – it’s harder edged, refreshingly bitter, weedy and piney, with a nice peachy and grapefruity hop character.

This is medium bodied, bitter, but very drinkable.

I really enjoyed this one, but I think I ultimately enjoyed The Alchemist’s version a tiny bit more, for whatever that is worth."
2972,mothman,Flood Relief IPA,4.25,"Side by side with HF version. Alchemist gets the slight nod. Both are excellent!

Alchemist has their house ipa flavor, think heady, maybe focal. Dank, pine, weed. Very hoppy and nice bitterness.

HF version is pretty similar but has a bit more New Zealand hop profile and some stone fruit. Floral, earthy, soft, bitterness in the finish."

Aroma is earthy, nearly dank, with an overtone of pine resin.

Flavors include pine and grapefruit, including the pith, but also include more fruit notes like mango, lime, and tangerine. All these are firmly supported with a strong malt background to include cracker and caramel.

Full mouthfeel is not quite sticky, but keeps a pine/grapefruit remainder.

Overall a solid example of the style."
2975,hman43,Steve Austin's Broken Skull Double IPA,3.59,"Look: It pours golden with white head. It has good clarity. Head retention is very good. 

Smell: It has citrus aromas with mangos. It also has some paypaya notes with a very low caramel touch. 

Taste: The flavors are fruity, but a bit muted. It does have citrus and papaya with some mango touches. There are also very light caramel and pine touches. 

Feel: It has a medium body with a mildly bitter aftertaste. 

Overall, the flavors are not what I expected being muted. It's a decent beer, but not as flavorable as it could be."

Pours clear yellow with a chill-haze. Minimal retention or lacing. Citrus and pine in the nose. Medium bodied with a crisp mouthfeel. Grapefruit, pine, faint tangerine on the palate with minimal malt and a balancing bitterness. Finishes crisp, piney and fairly dry."
2982,hopley,Data Set #1,4.32,"Overall very smooth and enjoyable - no bitterness, more of a malt presence, and a thick mouthfeel. I could do with a bit more “oomph” in the taste in some way. It is the “base beer” for the series so maybe it’s not going for the wild sides - but certainly enjoyable, coiffable, and worthy of another can, or two for good measure…"
2983,ovaltine,Data Set #1,4.17,"Pours a very hazy pineapple color with a frothy off white head that exhibits the ubiquitous TH lacing, i.e., it coats the glass. Lovely beer. The nose has some pineapple, mango, passion fruit, and a
bit of tangerine. Very nice, but it doesn’t “pop” like the typical TH juice bomb.

Lots of mango, pineapple, and passion fruit on the taste, with some tangerine and a nice little sweet oat flavor. Again, very nice, but it doesn’t grab you by your beer nerd family jewels and carry you to the upper echelon of the TH catalog of juice bomb. As the can says, this is the house yeast and the “control” beer in this series, so maybe it’s dialed back a bit.

The mouthfeel is just a bit softer than normal, almost a bit watery. This is still a beer worthy of your time, but I’m curious to see how the balance of this family of beers plays out with the different yeast types."
2984,Roguer,Data Set #1,4.11,"All my reviews of the Data Set series will be compared to the base beer, as best as possible.

Fairly subdued aroma. Balanced fruitiness, but not a ton stands out. Mostly tropical, along with a touch of citrus.

Similar on the palate. Very juicy but light, given the ABV. Notes of kiwi, banana, wheat, pale dough, melon, and mango. Creamy and smooth, but not quite up to par with Tree House's best.

I can't help but think that Tree House intentionally dialed down the hop selection here to be very tasty, but not anywhere near their best, so that the yeast selection will stand out more across this series. This is a pretty damn good beer in its own right, but it's more important to set the baseline."
2985,brewme,Data Set #1,4.25,"Picked-up a single can as part of a mixed four pack of this series for about twenty dollars. My three hundred and seventh brew from these guys. Canned on date of 3/10/23. Solid, not outstanding."

Pours an opaque light brownish yellow with about two fingers of tight white head. Excellent retention and lacing.

Fruit on the crack of the can. Pineapple, mango, oranges. Some earthy notes after the pour.

Some fruit on the taste. Also some decent piney bitterness as well as a chalky flavor.

Medium to full-bodied sticky-ish mouthfeel. MEdium carbonation. Bitter aftertaste.

Good beer. Chalkiness is a bit of a bummer."

2989,Mindcrime1000,Dank 7,4,"Poured into a Nonic.

Pours medium gold and cloudy with an outstanding foamy head that retains well. Good lacing.

Solid malts on the nose. Grassy and faintly piney hops. Lemon and spice.

Too hoppy to be a Saison, as advertised, but the essential flavors of the base beer are still there. The mixture of the sweet malts and esters playing with the grassy/earthy hop is a nice balance. Some apple and lemon in midstream. Just a hint of warming booze. At risk of offending fans of Duvel, the flavors remind me a bit of the hoppy variants of that brew. 

Well-rounded feel. Medium bodied. Not crisp but rather drying without resort to the booze, which is detectable but not more than a tingle. For a Boulevard, the carbonation is a little disappointing. I have a feeling that a little more, at the level of the base beer would have made everything about this brew better.

A solid variant of a favorite brew. It's not quite as good as the original."

22SEPT2023 etched onto bottom of 12oz can. Poured into BA teku.

Appearance - Clear, very slightly hazy gold body with sudsy white head, a little loose. Good stick. Small slightly loose tufty lacing. 4.75

Smell - Lives up to its name perfectly. Banana. Slight dark fruit. Wet grass. 5

Taste - Grassy. A little aged and not as sweet as the nose. A flawless if boldly neutral IPA. Almost as if it's missing something. Any malt, probably. Maybe just enough to keep it from being overly sharp, and not a touch more. 4.75

Mouthfeel - Medium bodied. A little syrupy. But the hop astringency and foamy fizz carbonation balance it out. 4.75

Overall - Inoffensive. But not boring. Was hoping the taste was more like what the nose was leading me to expect."

Smell - dank, citrusy, piney, spicey
Taste - piney, citrus, pear, spice
Feel - medium body, moderate carbonation, dry finish
Overall - Dank 7 is a proper name. The scent is dank for sure with pine, citrus and spice. Taste is piney resin, spice, orange and pear. Medium body but has a lighter feel with a dry finish. My first Belgian style IPA and I'll be tipping more of these back. Put Dank 7 on your list of beers to try and pair her up with Dust in the Wind by Kansas for your ultimate drinking and listening pleasure. Cheers!"
2993,Harrison8,Dank 7,4.06,"Pours a copper-yellow with a mild haze to the translucency. Head is three fingers of white foam. Aroma is Belgian spice, with clove and bready malts. Spicy and dank hops form the bulk of the nose, with Belgian spice the next biggest. Flavor profile is Belgian spice mixed with heavy spicy and dank hops. More dank at the end, as the spicy hops fade off. Clove is mixed in, giving it more of a Belgian flavor profile. Mouth feel is medium-thick with a fuzzy texture. Overall, heavy Belgian spice and smooth, despite big hops. 

Draft. Reviewed from notes."
2994,Blogjackets,Dank 7,4.08,"Poured from a twelve ounce can, the body is a cloudy yellow with small initial head. Light lacing.

Nose is a pleasant mix of Belgian yeast and hops.

Taste follows nose and there's a small hop bite from the 7 hops (Simcoe, Chinook, Citra, Topaz, Columbus, Mosaic and Bravo). The beer cleans up nicely: a soft fade.

Good carbonation and soft mouthfeel. Very easy drinking."
2995,VABA,Dank 7,4.25,"Pours a nice hazy golden color with a generous head and lacing

2996,defunksta,Dank 7,3.84,"Appearance: Pours a slightly hazy (50% clarity) bright golden color with a massive white head that lingers and pillows. SRM of 8-9. (4.25)

Aroma: Strong aromas of orange citrus and Belgian esters. Some hints of that Tank 7 juicyfruit aromas. (4.00)

Flavor: Strong flavors upfront of orange and lemon citrus, some tangeirne and pine, but fades quickly. As it evolves some Belgian esters and bread spices emerge among a cloying malt sweetness. Cloves, bubblegum, bread spice mixes with sweet bread malts. Finishes malty and slightly sweet. (3.75)

Feel: Medium to heavier bodied, carbonation doesn't quite match. Sweetness overpowers the yeast and carbonation. Finishes slightly flat and sweet. (3.75)

Overall: Finally got my hands on this one. Supposedly similar to their flagship Tank 7, but with a hop addition. I get some orange citrus, but not much pine or bitterness here. Maybe it’s the age, but still within the BB date. I think the intent was a hoppy Tank 7, but many of the great components of Tank 7 seem to be lost here. It’s decent. (Rating: 3.84)"

2998,jlindros,Works Of Love: Russian River Brewing / The Lost Abbey,4.48,"2019 vintage, conditioning since 2020/09/29... whoa, exactly 3 years to the day
Pours a frothy small fizzy off-white head with fair to lower retention, a bit of lacing, decent legs, dark mahogany to molasses color almost blackish

Nose explodes with cherry, loads of juicy cherry and a bit of bramble blackberry behind that, some tart wine barrel, dark red wine with some buttery oak, a bit of sweet malt, candy apple, earthy undertones, a bit of acidity funk

Taste starts quite tart, fair amount of sour acidic bacteria funk, quite sour overall, into tangy fruit, more juicy cherry but somewhere between Balaton and Sour cherry, mild bramble blackberry, a bit of inky red wine, mild buttery oak with vanilla spice, a little raisin and date like maybe prune fruit, touch of candy malt, flemmy tangy finish with more acidity and fruit lingering

Mouth is med bod, lower carb, high acidity, flemmy finish

Overall quite nice, very sour, nice barrel, great fruit that combined well, a very nice beer from Hill as usual"
2999,GreesyFizeek,Works Of Love: Russian River Brewing / The Lost Abbey,4.14,"This one pours a dark-ish purple/red color, with a small head, and lots of lacing.

This smells like funky and tart blackberry, blueberry, red wine, oak, and funky lemon.

This is pretty sour, as something with this heavy of a berry component would naturally. However, it’s definitely not as tart or sour as some of the more heavy handed fruited beers in the recent Harvest series, so that’s something. There’s a great barrel character here, darkly wine heavy, and pretty oaky, and that does help balance some of the acidity from the heavy berry infusion. There’s also a hint of oaky vanilla as well.

This is light bodied, tart, and pretty drinkable, despite the acidity.

This isn’t my absolute favorite in this series, but it was still very enjoyable."
3000,SpeedwayJim,Works Of Love: Russian River Brewing / The Lost Abbey,4.01,"375ml capped bottle into a DDG teku. 

Pours a deep mahogany. Oily legs. Spotty lace. Quickly collapsing light cream colored head. Nose is lightly tart. I get prunes, crushed raspberries, and dark cherries. Beer opens tart raspberry skin and stem. Prunes and dark cherry skin in the middle. Puckeringly tart. Oak and vanilla smooths out the edges towards the end. Body is light to medium with ample carbonation. Foamy on the palate and goes down bubbly. Long, lingering finish. 

Solid and a privilege to try."
3001,Hyptochrons,Works Of Love: Russian River Brewing / The Lost Abbey,4.33,"pours out a brownish amber color with a tan head. aromas are slightly metalitc, fruity, and rustic earthy funk. definitely russian river vibes on this so far! on the palate is a prominent sour cherry flavor - some acidity and musty flavors dancing in there. under-ripe blackberry and some dark grape hints in there and a definite vinegar like flavor. it's a bit in your face in some ways, with the tartness and cherry flavor, but still very good."
3002,Roguer,Data Set #3,3.7,"Pours much brighter, a lemon-yellow color than the others in the series.

Nose is significantly earthier, with moderate dankness and distinct notes of pepper and dirty earth. There are juicy notes of pineapple and mango, but they're buried beneath the pungent dankness. I'm frankly not encouraged by the aroma for my particular preferences.

Much juicier on the palate, and the dankness is definitely a little bit restrained. Moderately sweet. Tasting notes of pineapple, mango, and melon lead the way, with tangerine, banana, and cream on the back third."
3003,ovaltine,Data Set #3,4.25,"Pours a very hazy pineapple color with a creamy white head and lots of lacing. Beautiful beer. The nose is similar to Data Set #1 and features pineapple, mango, passion fruit, and tangerine, but it’s “brighter,” if that makes sense.

The mango and passion fruit are forward and delicious on the taste, with pineapple and tangerine flavors following, and then a nice little sweet oat note. Again, this tracks to #1, but the flavors pop a bit more.

A full, soft mouthfeel is expected and found. This is very good, something I’d definitely revisit."

3005,NCSapiens,Hazelnut Butter Cup Pastry Stout,4.22,"Sweet and full of strong artificial flavors, like most of untitled arts pastry stouts. In this case the sweetness is not too cloying, and the hazelnut, chocolate and coconut come together in harmony over the backdrop of roasted malt and hops. Tastes pretty good, like dessert, though slightly less than the sun of its parts."
3006,1BrewBacca,Hazelnut Butter Cup Pastry Stout,4.5,"Almost pitch black pourwoth a short head that disappeared way too fast. Oily lace on the glass.
It smells and Taste exactly like the name implies. Very high on the sweetness scale .
Had to dump up the feel because of the 11.7% ABV. Thick and syrupy on the tongue.
Fortunately I decided to down this one after dinner. What a great desert beverage. I see more in my future."
3007,Scotchboy,Hazelnut Butter Cup Pastry Stout,4.11,"Loving these Untitled Art pastry stouts; 12oz can poured into a snifter. Pretty much pitch black with a dark brown/mocha-colored head. Rich nutty aromas of peanut butter and hazelnut, chocolate and cacao nib, faint banana, more of the same on the palate with an added vanilla sweetness, some roasty presence reminiscent of flavored coffee. Very sweet, not quite cloying but good in small doses."
3008,StonedTrippin,Hazelnut Butter Cup Pastry Stout,3.98,"another intensely flavored dessert stout from these guys, fun to try, but always thankful to be sharing them around a number of ways, not sure who could or would want to drink more than a little bit of most of them. this has that floured nut thing to me, none of the textural richness real nuts provide, its syrupy and sweet without that but not round and gentle feeling, still, the hazelnut has some authenticity to it, i just wish they didnt bog this down with so many other things, like does this need coconut in it? does it need caramel color? its already near black in the glass, whats the point? sometimes these guys come across a bit gimmicky and all the extras is often why, what can that possibly do to this thats favorable? unspecified artificial flavors too, come on. in any event, the coconut is subtle, behind the hazelnut, chocolate is way up there with the bitter nibs providing a needed counterpoint to the sweeter layers this has, some roast and coffee character in the mix of course too, the base stout is pretty sturdy. i like what the brown sugar does with the cocoa and the hazelnut, and thats where this wins. totally palate coating but not overly alcoholic for its listed strength, and overall this is a fun sipper, distinct with all this flavor, without a doubt overdone, but better than so many others in this increasingly obnoxious style space. i dont trust untitled art, something fishy about it all, but i have had a good time tasting some of their weirder offerings since they have been for sale in idaho..."
3009,BEERchitect,Hazelnut Butter Cup Pastry Stout,4.25,"End goal: make beer taste like Nutella. That's what exactly what the brewers of Untitled Art and Eighth State have in mind when heading into their collaboration formulation.

A basic and jet black color, Hazelnut Butter Cup Pastry Stout settles in with an espresso dark appearance, and underneath a dense blanket of sandy tan foam. The promise of chocolate and hazelnut is delivered in the beer's scent swirling with mocha, coffee, nuttiness and toffee. Those hazelnut and chocolate flavors grow quickly on the tongue as the malts are a straight forward dialogue of milk chocolate, nutella, fudge and deeply caramelized sugars.

As its blissful flavors slather the middle palate, the more robust taste of sweet chocolate morsels, espresso, walnut and toasted hazelnuts create a savory and unabashed dessert effect on the tastebuds. Full saturation of deeply caramelized malts start to become fudgy on the late palate in a pleasantly cloying, slightly bitter balance.

Unabashedly full in body, the ale is simply larger than life. Its thickness is redolent of cake batter as the malts cling to the softer tissues of the mouth without restraint. Cut slightly only by its kahlua-like spice, this beer is a chocoholics kryptonite. A long and savory-sweet draw of all-things-nutella lingers effortlessly and welcomingly into the next baited sip."

T: Just like it advertised, you taste the milk chocolate at front along with the cacao nibs, hazelnut, brown sugar, with a coconut sweet ending. Very interesting. The more I sip the hazelnut stands out more with the coconut aftertaste. 
F: Easy to drink, sweet pastry stout for sure. Alcohol is well hidden. Full bodied, thick. Be careful, this is delicious.

3014,Roguer,"And Hey, Fuck 2023 Too",4.38,"Absolutely gorgeous for the style: completely opaque, a soft lemon-orange hybrid color, with excellent head production, retention, and lacing. Frankly, it's difficult to imagine a better-looking NE-style IPA.

Nose is softer than I imagined, with lush tropical fruit and very little, if any, herbal harshness from the hops.

Definitely sharper on the palate, at least up front - a combination of the intense hoppiness and the ABV, I suspect. Tropical notes are mostly on the back third, bringing mango, cream, and papaya. Up front, there's more of a citrus bite. It's definitely a bit astringent, but it's very drinkable at the same time.

Smooth and creamy on the palate, but retains plenty of bite. Excellent example of the style.

This is a fantastic example of the style, by a brewery that does it almost as good as anyone else."

3018,BEERchitect,"And Hey, Fuck 2023 Too",4.25,"If the past few years have been rough, you're not alone. Abomination is the brewery fitting to be enjoyed through such strife as their Fuck (enter year here) series extends into 2023. If the world is going down swinging at least we have something tasty to drink while we're at it.

Densely packed, creamy and plush at its pour, And Hey Fuck 2023 Too leaps right out with a teeth-churning scent of tropical, citrus, stone, berry and orchard fruits that hover just above a dense and creamy white cap. With the first sip of creamy sweetness, notions of cereal, pouncake, honey and coconut soothe the senses before an onslaught of hops.

Pulling from the grain sweetness are the hops and their flavorful cornucopia of pineapple, passionfruit, under ripened mango, kiwi and papaya from a tropical standpoint and with a quick followup of red grapefruit, mandarin orange and lime. While the juiciness of honeydew, gooseberry and pawpaw round out the cushiony session, a bitterness of green tea, spruce, fresh grassiness, verbena, cannabis and sassafras add a peppery and balancing bite.

Full bodied, creamy and plush on the palate, the bold ale is seriously drinkable and almost refreshing as its bitterness and booze hits the palate like a creamy mixed drink of cocktail elixir. An extension of fruit pulp and peel is met with creamy cereal for a bitter-sweet and spicy aftertaste."

3027,ovaltine,Eyes To The Sky,4.35,"Pours a gorgeous unfiltered straw color with a foamy white head that lingers as a cap on the body of the beer and provides moderate lacing. Beautiful WCIPA. 

The nose is dank and slightly weedy, with some lemon, mango, and peach notes for good measure. I am already a big fan of the Strata, Simcoe, and Columbus hop trifecta before the first sip.

The taste exceeds expectations (for me), with lots of dank weedy, earthy flavors joining with the citrus notes (mango and lemon) and stone fruit (peaches) to provide a WCIPA that is SOOOOOO drinkable and ventures a bit off the typical “bitter WCIPA” that I enjoy.

That’s another way of saying I’m expanding my beer nerd horizons. At 60 years old, I’m glad to be cognizant of expanding anything.

The mouthfeel is medium and drying, per the style. I wish I’d purchased a truckload of this flavorful beer that confidently ventures a bit outside the WCIPA box."

3038,angrybabboon,Fusion,4.28,"Consumed 4/27/23

Golden yellow with some orange hues, very hazy, medium sized head that fades to wisps and retains a small collar
Distinctively Julius at its core, floral citrus, juicy citrus, tangerine, orange, orange juice, ruby red grapefruit, herbal hops, green and leafy hops, pineapple, mango, loads of banana, both fresh, ripe banana chunks and dried, candied banana, some banana candy, some candy-like fruity sweetness but in moderation, pale malts, finishes fairly clean with some lingering hops and fruity esters
Medium body, smooth, low carbonation

Another day, another variant of a Tree House classic. The addition of orange here is pretty subtle compared to the banana. It's an interesting combination of fresh banana and some banana candy. Like the other variants, this does not really improve on Julius, but it's lovely."
3039,GreesyFizeek,Fusion,4.25,"This one pours a hazy golden yellow color, with a small head, and lots of lacing.

This smells like orange, tangerine, pineapple, caramelized and candied banana, orange creamsicle, and some light pine.

I don’t necessarily know if I’d be able to tell that this has orange added, but the banana is a clear and unique addition, adding some caramelized earthiness to the soft, juicy, and pillow Julius everything knows.

This is soft, creamy, and quite drinkable.

This is another one that I couldn’t have a ton of, but I certainly enjoy it."
3040,brewme,Fusion,3.75,Picked-up two cans at Tree House in Sandwich for about twelve dollars. My three hundred and seventh brew from these guys. Canned on date of 3/22. Way too much Nana for me.
3041,tigg924,Fusion,4.57,"Pours hazy, gold in color with one half inch head. Taste is big banana, orange, and mango with a touch of vanilla. Medium body, moderate low carbonation, slightly sweet. Best orange beer from Tree House so far. I like the combination with the banana. Still retains Julius flavor."
3042,57md,Fusion,4.13,"This baby is a true freshie - 5 days old!

Julius with orange and banana.

Well, I am definitely getting the orange. The nose smells like an orange creamsicle. The flavor starts with the same orange creamsicle upfront but gets pithy on the finish.

I'm getting a little banana on the flavor but that might be more power of suggestion than anything else."
3043,322wingedfoot,Fusion,4.08,"From a 16oz can dated 03/21/23. From the Tree House website: “Fusion is a rendition of Julius brewed with orange and banana! Sometimes the rules need to be bent in service of a great day. Wearing your pajamas well into the afternoon, taking the long route home to finish a podcast, or in this case–breakfast for dinner. We took two staples of a complete breakfast and blended them into nothing short of a hop bomb. The burst of citrus you’ve come to expect from Julius is bolstered by the addition of these unsung heroes of the A.M. We taste oranges so ripe you have to eat them over the sink, old fashioned banana moon pies, and sugared grapefruits. The beer you are holding is a delight and is the result of our ever refining foray into thoughtful additions of the finest purées. We hope you enjoy this riff on a Tree House classic as much as we do!” Tasty but maybe a tad too much banana?"

f) Finishes bitter with drying, resinous feel. Butt kicker.
o) Top DIPA"
3048,BEERchitect,Pacific Dawn West Coast DIPA,4.25,"Since imperial IPA don't usually carry more bitterness than standard strength IPA, but they do register fuller body, sweeter taste and more plump fruitiness. To create a greater impression of ""hoppiness"" Captain Lawrence knows to ramp up the hop aromas and flavors instead.

Light honey amber upon its pour, Pacific Dawn soon billows the rim with a cottony white froth. As its radiant perfrume of citrus, herb, tropical fruit and berry swoons the nose, its first sip is supple and sweet with caramel, nuttiness and lightly toasted grain to present a mild trail mix maltiness early on the palate.

But as the malts play only a supporting role, its the hops that steal the stage with a bold display of branch ripe tangerine, red grapefruit and a bright lime zest character. Shifting to a more tropical taste, the middle palate opens with mango, passionfruit, kiwi and starfruit before trending cleanly bitter with green tea, fresh spruce, peppery hemp and a follow through of blackcurrant as the late palate closes.

Medium-full in body, the strong IPA finishes decidedly bitter in balance with a drying, resinous mouthfeel. Pleasantly spicy with elevated alcohol, the session is as refreshing as it is flavorful for a throwback taste that's sure to appease the most classic of hop heads."
3049,JohnniEMc,Pacific Dawn West Coast DIPA,3.9,"The label describes this as a double dry hopped West Coast IPA. The closest available category seems to be Imperial IPA, considering its ABV of 9.1%. It's not an easy pour to empty a pint can into a clear glass liter mug. There's a mess of stark white foam to deal with. It recedes quickly, leaving almost no glass lacing. Many brewers shortchange the barley malt in a West Coast IPA to get the dryly hoppy sensation. It appears to be done here. The liquid is amber, on the bright side, well carbonated and just a bit cloudy. The aroma is hoppy, sharp, acute and one dimensional. There's just a little starch within it, too. It's taste is, well, OK. It's not a hop bomb, but there's little more to taste. The hops are piney and maybe a little citrusy, but they finish dry, as they should. Then, there's an almost minty taste inclusion at the end. The body is about as thin as expected, yet it somehow provides a little counterbalance to the hops. There's an alcohol hit. It's not a terrible thing early, but it grows in a negative way. Overall, this seems like it's designed to be pounded for a quick buzz with just a little taste. That it does nicely. It would be hard to imagine beer geeks discussing the subtleties of this one's tastes, because there aren't any. It does fit within the standard West Coast IPA taste profile, but there are much better samples. West Coast IPAs aren't particularly well regarded for their body and this comes up even shorter than that norm."
3050,FretFingers,German Porter,4.27,"This is not a ""Baltic Porter""! It is a dark Dopplebock very similar to Korbinian or Spaten Optimator. Even says ""Lager"" on the can and in the brewers description below! Please re-classify this. Nonetheless, it is a very good beer! 
Poured into a half-litre dimpled mug from a 16oz can. 
Appearance: Very dark brown almost black with frothy tan head that retains pretty well. Nice lacing.
Smell: Roasted malt, burnt sugar, slight alcohol.
Taste: Not a malt bomb! Fairly dry for the style, almost like an Altbier. Hops are almost not present, roasted malt flavor is not overly dominant - very well balanced. Refreshing slight sweetness but not cloying.
This one will be on my regular list especially since Spaten Optimator is being discontinued."

The only other “German Porter” I’ve had previously was from Jack’s Abby and I thought it was exceptional. I haven’t been the biggest fan of Urban Chestnut so far but figured they were worth giving another shot for something like this. Let’s crack it open and see what’s going on

Pours a very dark reddish brown with 3 fingers of frothy light tan head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing

The nose shows a wonderful balance of roasty and fruity notes. I’m picking up on aromas of dark toast, raisin, brown sugar, medium roast coffee, burnt caramel, rye bread, leather, black pepper, earthy hops, and black cherry

It doesn’t have quite the same impactful balance in taste, but it’s pretty damn close. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting dark bread, toffee, raisin, black pepper, cocoa powder, light roast coffee, and brown sugar. The swallow brings notes of black pepper, dark toast, black cherry, earthy hops, leather, raisin, burnt caramel, and medium roast coffee

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a smooth beer with a nice bite. Finishes mostly dry and balanced

Urban Chestnut has absolutely redeemed themselves with this one. I could throw these back all day"

T -- Dominant roasted malts with a mocha-java character. Mellow dark fruits and earthy, herbal bitterness in the aftertaste.

F -- Mouthfeel is soft to slick with a dry finish and medium-robust body.

O -- Starkbier translates to strong beer from German, so doesn't necessarily equate directly to Doppelbock -- just strength. This beer is a very nice winter warmer with great Baltic Porter traits... and very deceptive in its ABV."
3056,Jmsandberg17,German Porter,4,"16oz can pours an extremely deep brown-black color with a small amount of dark tan-colored head that recedes to a thin ring and a extremely thin island in the center. Smells of burnt, dark, and roasted malts with a robust smoky/woody/earthy note. Layered and robust flavor of burnt malts, roasted malts, dark fruits, coffee, very dark chocolate, wood, and smoke. Moderate bitterness with an earthy/herbal type of flavor that lingers into an extended aftertaste. Medium to heavy body with a subtle sweetness and a slightly prickly-slightly creamy carbonation mouthfeel. 

This was a very good and very unique beer and honestly quite different to what I expected when I purchased. The woody/earthy/smoky flavors lend a very interesting note but it certainly won't be for everyone. Would consider buying again."

Medium roast coffee bean, bacon, mild smoke & faint fresh earth notes in the nose. Wow, wasn't expecting something this bold! 

Creamy, medium thick mouthfeel. 

Milk chocolate, rich cream, fresh earth & mild smoked bacon flavors.

The beer is dark brown, almost black, with a tall, firm, and rocky tan head. The aroma has a roasty quality, with plenty of chocolate and coffee notes, similar to a porter (hence the name, I suppose). The taste is equally roasted, with a firm malt sweetness in the middle. I can tell it is a lager, not an ale, through the roasted qualities...it doesn't have the ale-like fruit notes. Full in body and it hides its alcohol very well. This is an interesting and very enjoyable beer."

Aromas of dark chocolate, lighter cocoa/cake batter, vanilla, tobacco, anise. Hints of booze.

The brew delivers sweet chocolate malt for a fleeting instant before dark chocolate, tobacco, leather, oak, anise, vanilla, and dark/dried fruits (plum, raisin, fig, and a hint of cherry) all join the party. Plenty of bourbon at the finish.

Full bodied with a long finish. But the carbonation is solid and welcome; more present than most of the style. Very warm from the bourbon aging, but not hot or boozy per se. 

Another great delivery of this Surly hallmark."

3070,JohnniEMc,Shameless Amount of Hops,4.37,"It's a close to perfect pour that emptied the contents of a pint can into a clear glass liter mug. There's an appropriate head, just off white in color. The beer is brightly amber with a golden tint, but on the translucent side for this being a hazy DIPA. Although much less than pungent, there are citrus, berry and even a little pine notes for the nose. Like the aroma, the taste doesn't overly impress with hops. It drinks nicely enough, just a little milder than expected. So it's not really hazy, nor real hoppy, but it is really good. There's a wonderful malt backbone, the kind that was once an integral part of any IPA, back in the day. More accurately, it's not lacking hops, it's lacking a bitter bite from them. But there is a definite hop taste that is moderately bitter, moderately earthy and dryly clean. There's no glass lacing and the head didn't sustain. But the mouthfeel is superb; rich, full and smooth. So much so, you may double-check to be sure you read the 8.4% ABV on the label correctly. This once nearly perfect brewery has had a few misfires lately, but this isn't one of them. It's excellent, even if it was somewhat misleading."

A - Dark medium gold colored pour with moderate, soapy dense white lacing.

S - Sweet citrus, grapefruit, orange, tangerine. Very fruity and aromatic when first poured but loses ""steam"" after it sits in the glass for several minutes. The initial pour was really impressive on the nose.

T - The overall experience is earthy citrus from start to finish. Grapefruit, citrus, tangerine, passion fruit, papaya, and finishes on the sweeter side with lingering earthy citrus.

M - Big medium body that's soft and smooth that leaves a layer of citrus earthiness lining the mouth.

O - Rock solid (but prefer Enjoy By) compared to this. Still, definitely worth a try."

The taste is centered around the rich chocolate and roasty coffee flavors, which are delicious, but the star for me is the surprising stone fruit flavor, which is delectable dark cherries, and the barrel, which is oaky and most present as a warming alcohol note at the back of the palate. Delicious stuff.

The mouthfeel is rich and creamy, commensurate with a beer of this gravity. This is really well done, IMHO."
3090,GreesyFizeek,Moher Mocha,4.26,"This one pours a very dark black color, with a small head, and a little bit of lacing.

This smells like milk chocolate, roasted malt, maple bourbon candy, and creamy coffee.

Tree House makes their own excellent coffee at this point, so their coffee stouts have elevated in quality alongside that development. This is very chocolatey, both from the nibs and how chocolatey the coffee seems to be. There’s bourbon, maple, molasses, and a nice light candied truffle sort of thing.

This is creamy, sweet, and drinkable. It’s maybe a *touch* sweeter than the typical balance I expect from Tree House, but it’s not a detractor by any means."
3091,DokiDokiLitFam,Moher Mocha,4.45,"Tree House seems to be upping the ante with these stouts. They have done well with the stouts they've had, but now they are going into serious big boy territory with barrel aged coffee stouts. This one has notes of coffee of course, oak, creamy milk chocolate, roasted malt, and salted pretzel. The taste delivers. The oak, coffee, and chocolate come together really well. Nothing quite strikes like a barrel aged coffee stout. Mouthfeel is fullbodied and smooth. A touch cloying, but the tannins keep it in check. Great stuff. These Stout bottle expressions seem to be trending towards the more the upper crust, top tier rating. As if Tree House weren't constantly doing that already."
3092,Roguer,Moher Mocha,4.32,"Phenomenal aroma. It's not light on the bourbon, but it's not at all aggressive or harsh on the nose. Notes of bourbon, chocolate, molasses, coffee, sherry, cherry, toast, light char, toffee, honeycomb.

Less rich on the palate than the nose, with a bit of a sharper (but not unpleasant) profile. Coffee and red grape notes stand out quite a bit, and the bourbon mash leans toward the sour side. The chocolate comes through on the second half in a massive wave, bringing the richness that the front end lacks. Nice warming heat. Additional tasting notes of molasses, licorice, toast, caramel, nuts.

Very smooth mouthfeel. While there's a bit of heat from the alcohol, it's never aggressive; you can easily sip, sit, savor, and chew this one.

As good as this beer is, the flavor is definitely a letdown after the amazing nose, which gave me the impression that I was about to taste an absolute world-class, one-of-a-kind blended BA stout - and while it's excellent, it's not that."
3093,BigIronH,Moher Mocha,4,"Excellent bitter roasted coffee, sweet milk chocolate, and roasted malt notes with a complex vanilla/burnt oak barrel note. Feel is thick and oily, nearly syrupy. Overall excellent."

S: chocolate, buttercream, coffre
T: sweet x3, 
F: hot breaths after you know what you did. Who will talk first 
O: rich, but delicious."
3095,MrDarcy,Moher Mocha,3.98,Cocoa powder and vanilla creme. Mild boozy sharpness from the whiskey and some dark fruit tannic bitterness from the cacao nibs. A bit hot but no green pepper detected. Possibly an anomaly from other reviews!?! Decent but not memorable.
3096,Rug,Moher Mocha,3.11,"Nothing like ending St. Patty's Day (ok, early the next morning) with a Stout that ""approximate the flavor of Irish Whiskey"". After a day of drinking in Boston, seeing Dropkick Murphys, and dislocating my shoulder, this is just what I need to relax with. Let's crack it open and see what it's all about

Pours completely pitch black with a finger of dark mocha head that slowly fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing

Oh man, this is about as coffee-bomb as they come in the nose. I'm picking up on aromas of acidic coffee, roasted coffee beans, milk chocolate, toasted oak, sweet whiskey, vanilla, brown sugar, light cherry, and burnt caramel

Man what the fuck. Just as the one other reviewer has noted, this tastes like a goddamn bell pepper. It sucks too because up front it's very promising, but then enters a realm of vomit. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting medium roast coffee, milk chocolate, caramel creme, vanilla, dark cherry, toasted oak, sweet whiskey, and light caramel. The swallow brings notes of green bell pepper, acrid coffee, burnt caramel, and black cherry. That's it

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a boozy hot beer. Finishes neutral with a serious burn to it

Absolutely not. This is the worst beer Tree House has ever released. Goddamn, I've never been so disappointed"
3097,tigg924,Moher Mocha,2.98,"Pours opaque, jet black in color with half inch head. Taste is Mocha, barrel and pepper. Heavy body, low carbonation, sweet and hot. Honestly the peppering hurts this. I love the Cliffs of Moher and wanted to like this. I just can't though...trying a new glass to hope for improvement...slight improvement."
3098,WoodBrew,Arctic Ancient Imperial IPA,4.19,I got a 4pck of tall boy cans of this beer from my local Giant Eagle store. It poured a hazy orangish with white head that is leaving some lace. The scent had dank tropical fruit notes. The taste was nicely balanced and easy to drink with bright semi sweet malt base with mango and apricot presence. The mouthfeel was medium in body and had good carbonation. Overall it is a solid beer.
3099,izraelc,Arctic Ancient Imperial IPA,4.25,Pours a pale gold. Thick foam. Dank aroma. Big fruity hop body. Pineapple and orange. Bitter hop resin finish. New school body with an old school finish. Definitely worth tasting.
3100,neenerzig,Arctic Ancient Imperial IPA,4.19,"Poured out of a 16 oz. can into my tulip glass, this beer pours a clear, medium copper color with lots of streams of little bubbles fairly rapidly and continuously rising to the surface. Has a fluffy looking, white head that's about an inch thick when first poured. Head eventually settles to a thick film layer surface coating along with a thick ring lining the inside of the glass, and some good lacing. Aromas of some bready malts and some citrus, floral, piney hop notes. A very similar taste, with some bready malts followed by the aforementioned floral, piney, and citrus hop flavors that provide a fair amount of bitterness. Although the hop flavors do dominate the flavor profile somewhat, as they should of course for a beer of this style, this beer isn't overly hoppy/bitter either. Has a crisp, also smooth, just slightly oily and chewy, full bodied mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Has a clean finish, and all of the flavors coat the inside of my mouth and linger nicely on my palate for awhile long after each sip. Another solid beer here from the fine folks at the GLBC!

This beer pours a golden hue and is topped with an inch of beige head that leaves decent lacing.

It has a candied orange aroma along with tropical fruit and melon smell. Light pine

Citrus flavor with an alcohol kick. I get some underlying peach. 

Medium bodied with a smooth mouthfeel

Pretty tasty imperial IPA."

O: nice work great lakes"
3103,schoolboy,Arctic Ancient Imperial IPA,4.13,"This was a nice find about a week ago - a nice fresh, big IPA from Great Lakes. I had one last week and now another.

It pours a deep translucent golden with fine head. The aroma is a slightly skunky hop smell - nice. The taste is fresh and tangy. It almost tastes like a lot of hazy IPAs but with a beautifully clean finish and less mess. It does have an immediate boozy feel too (though not so much in the aroma).

Highly recommended. This is one to get right now, but also if they make it again (seems likely) ... get some! It should keep thorough the holidays."
3104,defunksta,Arctic Ancient Imperial IPA,3.71,"Appearance: Pours a completely clear, deep orange color with a strong white head that lingers forever. SRM of 12. (4.00)

Aroma: Moderate aromas of orange, tangerine, ripe grapefruit, and some fruit punch. (3.50)

Flavor: Moderate flavors of orange, tangerine, over ripe grapefruit, some fruit punch and tropical melon sweetness underneath. Mild bitterness, but overall slightly sweet on the finish. (3.75) 

Feel: Medium to heavier body, average carbonation. Finishes juicy and sweet. (3.75) 

Compared to Surly Abrasive 12/2023: Pours lighter, clearer, stronger head. Milder aromas. More sweet grapefruit and fruit punch. Less dank tangerine, pine, melon. 

Overall: Pretty standard IPA flavors. Not really juicy, not really bitter. Sort of midwest sweet, but not overly so and hides the alcohol well. There's just not much to it and as usual the hops are overpowered by the malt sweetness as in most imperials. Not upset I tried it, but probably won't again. (Rating: 3.71)"

3106,Blogjackets,Arctic Ancient Imperial IPA,4.03,"Pours a clear orange-yellow with a fluffy white head and good lacing.

Taste has the expected assertive hop bitterness and sturdy malt backbone - though the beer does not lean malty. Satisfying finish as the bitterness closes things out.

Mouthfeel is soft and carbonation strong.

Another good if not great IPA from GLBC.."
3107,TryThemAllOnce,Brewa Bunga Cove,4.15,"I can't add much to the reviews that others have already provided. It's just very smooth odd looking with a golden color for what's called a imperial Stout, it's just great. I won't reach for it every time I go to the store but certainly a couple of times over the holidays, winter I'm up for it"
3108,Captain69,Brewa Bunga Cove,4.3,another great beer from this brewery - pours dark with thick head - big hazelnut smell full of nutty and vanilla flavor great beer to enjoy
3109,Kwatz88,Brewa Bunga Cove,4.48,To me it was very graham cracker and hazelnutty while not being too hoppy despite its light complection. Very smooth and fairly light. Overall one of my favorite pours ever.
3110,Jcarson237,Brewa Bunga Cove,4.21,"Tart start, fades to very sweet. Nutty aftertaste. Nice feel on the tongue, very crisp. Does indeed make me think of cold brew coffee. Exactly what I would have expected, sans a tad sweeter perhaps?"
3111,travis1108,Brewa Bunga Cove,3.24,"This beer tastes and SMELLS exactly like what it says it is and while I love these flavors in stout for some reason I'm not loving them here.
IDK. Maybe there's some mental disconnect coming from a golden brew. Fun to try and even more fun to share just to see the look on unexpectant faces but I probably wouldn't buy again.
Still I definitely recommend giving it a try"
3112,zeff80,Brewa Bunga Cove,4.21,"16oz can. Poured out a clear, golden color with a small, off-white head of foam. It left sudsy trails of lace. It smelled strongly of hazelnut, vanilla, coffee and roasted malt. Very sweet hazelnut taste with roasted coffee, chocolate, vanilla and caramel."
3113,jadejaws,Brewa Bunga Cove,4.79,"Surprisingly amazing beer. 
It may not be for everyone, but this is definitely a dessert beer.
A well done one at that.
Tastes like a delicious vanilla and hazelnut shake. 

Not a beer to drink one after another at 8%, but something to have to calm the nerves and serve a sweet tooth at the end of a bad day."
3114,whynot44,Brewa Bunga Cove,4.23,"Bright clear golden color with a respectable and lasting white head and some nice lacing. 
The aroma is hazelnut, a hint of coffee and light malt. 
The taste is very nice hazelnut with just a touch of coffee and light golden malt. 
The body is medium/full, good carbonation level, creamy smooth, dangerously drinkable. Altogether, this is a very tasty and enjoyable brew, the 8% ABV is very well hidden but still appreciated, outstanding."
3115,datstankadank,Stowe Style - Czech,3.52,"I love czech lagers. I've had A LOT more beers than I have rated or reviewed currently on this site, I've had a lot of czech lagers from czechia. This doesn't taste like any of them. It's so American in style I just don't get anything resembling a czech lager. It's good beer though. Not worth describing, underwhelming for this brewery. Human robot seems to only be found in name also. Meh."
3116,bobv,Stowe Style - Czech,4.21,"16 ounce can.
Best By 04/16/24.

Moderate pour yields a nearly 2 inch white head over a bright golden body with lacing.

Nose of floral/earthy hops, bread, toast, cracker, and malt.

Taste follows nose fairly closely. Smooth, with hop bitterness slowly taking charge over the bready, slightly sweet malt for a crisp finish.

Mouthfeel is fairly full with medium carbonation.

Overall, an excellent example of the style and definitely worth seeking out.

Cheers!"
3117,DavetotheB,Stowe Style - Czech,4.29,"From a 16oz can dated ""Best By"" 4/15/24 into a 20oz ""pint"" glass.

Pours a slightly hazy (not opaque) golden brown with about one finger of white head. Great retention and lacing.

Crack of the can yields aromas of earthy hops backed by sweet bready malt. A little warming brings the malt to the front with some floral notes.

Well balanced bready/bitter taste. Maybe slightly more on the bitter side.

Medium to full bodied mouthfeel for a lager. Medium to high carbonation. Smooth drinking with a bitter aftertaste.

This is a great lager."
3118,jmdrpi,Stowe Style - Czech,4.23,"on draft, in pint glass

clear golden in color, white head. decent head retention. Bready malt, earthy hops, but crisp and bitter . Very clean finish. Thin to medium bodied."
3119,Tolianych_Pivomnabuhanych,Stowe Style - Czech,5,"WOW! I was beginning to think Vermont brewers were challenged in the Czech style beer department. Like seriously handicapped. So many attempted various Pilsner and Pale Lager brews over the years and failed, miserably.

Enter ""Czech"" (Stowe Style), a delightful and impressive collab between Von Trapp (a fairly mediocre Vermont brewery) and Human Robot (a bunch of genius beerheads from Philly).

Everything about this beer is wonderful. It has a gorgeous rich golden color, a rewarding pale ale aroma, a taste gifted to this beer style by Beer Gods... I could go on and on, but I'll just simply get back to drinking it.

Approx $13 for a 4-pack of pint-sized cans. That's a very wallet-friendly price for Vermont beer. (Typically, shttty Vermont IPAs go for $16 a 4-pack of crap.)

I am impressed and highly recommend this Czech style pale ale to fellow aficionados."
3120,WoodBrew,Peel Pusher,3.9,"I got a can of this beer of the single shelf from my local Giant Eagle store. It poured a slightly hazy golden with thin white head that is leaving some lace. The scent had fresh mango and peach notes. The taste was nicely balanced and easy to drink with crisp light malt base with bright orange, peach and mango presence. The mouthfeel is medium in body with good carbonation. Overall it is a good beer."
3121,ovaltine,Peel Pusher,4.35,"Pours a slightly hazy orange color (but it’s more of an unfiltered hazy bs a turbid hazy) with a creamy white head that provides significant lacing. The nose is a sledgehammer of orange aromas and some mango and peach for good measure.

The oranges are forward and aggressive on the taste - but there’s enough mango and peach for balance. The full, dry mouthfeel masks any hint of the 8.5% ABV.

If you don’t like oranges, avoid this beer. But if you do like oranges (raises hand), this is an absolute delight to drink."
3122,KS_Augsburg,Poppy Seed Bun,4.28,"Hands down one if my favorite Pale Ales of all times, certainly one of my favorite ones from Hop Butcher. The kicker: the smell actually reminds me of a freshly baked poppy see bun. So very good!!"
3123,Franziskaner,Poppy Seed Bun,4.19,Dark gold to copper colored with a half inch of creamy beige on top. The aroma is of green onions. I’m tasting bitter green onions. The mouth is very approachable and refreshing.
3124,DoctorZombies,Poppy Seed Bun,4.18,"Deep amber pour with off white foam; excellent cap retention, solid ring; lots of soapy lace. Skunky dank tropical fruit nose. Grapefruit, sweet pineapple with a lemon/lime finish. Medium light body, moderate minus carbonation; no astringency. Overall, thin but crushable; I really like the Riwaka hop nose/taste."
3125,BEERchitect,Poppy Seed Bun,4.25,"Hot dog, hot diggity dog! Hop Butcher for the World uses what's best of Riwaka hops to fuel an otherwise classic American IPA that's as iconic as the Chicago dog.

Light honey amber and shaded in a light haze, Poppy Seed Bun tops off with a foamy ivory crown while swirling with the scent of citrus, tropical fruit, light herb and spruce. As juicy as its scent is, the taste is just as plump with toasty, caramel and shortcake driven malt.

As the attention turns back to the hops, the middle palate opens up with a burst of citrus. Pink grapefruit, tangerine and a sweeter lemon flavor provides a rounded fruitiness that leads into a more tropical taste of mango, papaya and peach. Tightening its grip a little, the late palate trends herbal with lemongrass, sun tea and fresh spruce needles for a bitter, peppery and lightly resinous balance.

Medium bodied, bitter-sweet and trending hoppy, the session closes with a bitter extension of grassy hops and a crisp, clean and highly refreshing after palate."
3126,brewskis,Poppy Seed Bun,3.92,"Pours a hazy burnt orange color with two fingers of an off-white, dense head. Dissipates slowly. A few floaties in there. Looks more like an old school pale ale, but with a much more unfiltered look.

Aroma is that Southern Hemisphere earthy funk, juicy ruby red grapefruit, tangerine, floral, and some lychee from the hops. Malt brings some bread and simple syrup notes.

Taste is ripe ruby red grapefruit flesh, orange slice candy, lychee, orange and grapefruit pith, lemon, and floral, with that characteristic Southern Hemisphere earthy funk layered over it all. Bread, slight caramel, and table sugar come from the malt. Dries out into the finish with a light bitterness.

Medium body. Soft, slick, smooth, slightly oily, chalky. Light medium carbonation.

I was hoping for an all old school APA with a new school hop, but this is more of a mashup of new and old school qualities. Has much more balance from the malts and that classic APA look (albeit with much more haze), but is much softer and rounded on the feel with less bitterness than desired. The hop character is interesting though. Not my favorite pale ale by these guys, but by no means is this a disappointing beer."
3127,jmdrpi,Athene Noctua,4.1,"16 oz can, dated almost 9 months ago - but figured with the style should be okay

pours black in color, thick khaki colored head. good head retention. aroma as it warms is fairly roasty - big dark cocoa. taste is similar but a little sweeter than expected. fuller bodied than expected for a lager."
3128,GreesyFizeek,Athene Noctua,4.08,"On tap at Three Penny Taproom in Montpelier, VT.

This one pours a very dark black color, with a small head, and lots of lacing.

This smells like baker’s chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, licorice, and some dark fruit.

This is pretty luxuriously creamy, with a bitter roasty and dry finish. There’s lots of dark chocolate, bitter but rich, with some lightly fruity sweetness. It’s herbal but sweet and really smooth.

This is smooth and very creamy, with no real booziness to it.

This is my first Eredita beer, and it only makes me want to try more of them!"
3129,russpowell,Athene Noctua,3.98,"Pours an effervescent ebony with one finger of tight mocha colored head. Some head retention & lacing

S: Super roasty, cola notes once warm

T: Roastyness, a little Baker's Chocolate& molasses up front, fairly dry & a little Chicory. More roastyness as this beer warms up, hints of smokeyness, carob & chicory, plus woody hops. Finishes dry, roasty with a little bit of woody hops & Chicory

MF: Medium body, smooth carbonation 

Classic Baltic Porter with much drinkability"
3130,bobv,Athene Noctua,4.34,"16 ounce can packaged on 02/28/23.

Moderate pour yields a 5/4 inch tan head over a near black body with sticky lacing.

Nose of roasted dark malt and chocolate malt with slight caramel and molasses.

Taste is dark malty chocolate and slight caramel with a tiny bit of nuttiness.

Feel is fairly full with nearly medium carbonation.

Overall, a real fine collaboration from two Hill Farmstead alumni and would definitely have again and highly recommend.

Cheers!!!"
3131,sulldaddy,Athene Noctua,4,"picked up a 4 pack of these cans on a whim today. Date stamp is canned on 2/28/2023. 
Pouring at cellar temp into my snifter.
the beer pours a coffee black color with a creamy beige to tan colored head of 1.5 cm. This foam fades to a sturdy edge layer and one large wispy island. Leaves windowpane lattice as it fades away.
Aroma is pretty mild on this one. I get a little dark chocolate and molasses with hints of dark fruit. No ABV tips and hops are absent.
First sip reveals a medium body with smooth texture and gentle carbonation. Beer drinks very easy.
Flavor is some roasted notes and molasses mixing together. I get some dark fruit, raisin mostly on the finish. Still never any hints of the ABV and hops are absent here too.
This is a pretty easy drinker with good baltic porter quality. Nice to have it made at a brewery 20 minutes from my house. Id buy this one again."
3132,ovaltine,PPPink,4.35,"Pours a hazy orange color with a creamy white head that trails a trail of lace on the glass a mile long. The nose is a nice mix of oranges, mango, and apricots. I love all three of these fruits, so I’m essentially drooling now.

The taste doesn’t disappoint with oranges and mango up front, delicious (and slightly tart) apricots mid-palate, before a nice bit of oats on the finish with a full, soft mouthfeel for exceptional drinkability.

A delight to drink, as is the case in my experience with all Tree House beers."
3133,Roguer,PPPink,4.24,"Simply flawless appearance for the style. Huge head production, and excellent retention.

Nose is pleasant, bright, and hoppy, but it's also fairly indistinct, lacking complexity or definition.

Like the nose, flavor is a bit of a melange, a blend of tropical and citrus notes. There is some definition on the palate, with some notes of orange, mango, and pineapple, but it mostly blends together - quite nicely."
3134,57md,PPPink,3.95,"Only ten days old when I cracked it open!

Pours an opaque light straw color with over a finger of head. The nose has some citrus fruit notes, but it is muted for a TH offering. The flavor profile has notes of guava and pomegranate. The bitterness starts off pretty low-level but picks up near the bottom of the glass."
3135,papposilenus,PPPink,3.88,"From a 16oz can, dated 03/23/23. Pink is my favorite crayon. Served in a Deerfield Taproom First Anniversary pub glass.

Pours a thoroughly murky orange juice-colour with a finger-plus pouffy white head of foam. Retention is good, leaving a solid sheet of creamy lacing.

Aroma isn’t especially forward. Muddled citrus, peach and tropical fruit, yeasty.

Flavour is chalky with gritty fruit skins and lots of citrus and leafy-green bitterness. Tasting orange peels, mango skin, peach skins, grape seeds, pineapple husks. Dense and dank, then goes sugary-sweet to finish.

Feel is juice-box-juicy, medium-plus bodied but with brisk, semi-aggressive carbonation making it feel a little lighter again. Some sour warmth in the gullet.

It’s like if Evil Minute Maid took all the peels, cores and scrapings that Good Minute Maid threw away when they made Hi-C and then made juice out of it and let it ferment in the fridge. Could use a Tums tbh."
3136,tigg924,PPPink,3.81,"Pours milky yellow in color, hazy with one inch head. Taste is big peach with light bubblegum and starfruit. Medium body, moderate carbonation, slightly bitter. Nice, smoothed over beer similar to the Mega series of other Tree House beers. Good but missing the bubblegum taste that makes the Pink series special and tasty. Easily number three in the series, a bit of a disappointment given how much I like the first two but a goodish beer."
3137,Sheppard,Curiosity One Hundred Thirty Six,3.17,"Pours a slightly murky looking golden. Tremendous head retention. Mango and pineapple on nose. Get some unripe mango, cat pee, unripe papaya. it’s kinda citra and possibly simcoe dominant and not necessarily in the best way."
3138,brewandbbq,Curiosity One Hundred Thirty Six,4.3,"16oz can dated 10/30/23.

Pours cloudy gold with an inch of white head. Moderate retention and lacing. Candied peach, mango, apricots in the nose. Medium bodied with a soft mouthfeel. Orange, peach, mango on the palate with minimal malt or bitterness. Finishes juicy and ripe."
3139,GreesyFizeek,Oyster,4.16,"Can purchased and drank at Fattey Beer Company in Rochester, NY.

This one pours a fairly pale hazy golden yellow color, with a small head, and lots of lacing.

This smells pretty peachy, with nectarine, grapefruit, and some light pine.

I wish Other Half did more actual pale ales, instead of all of the double/triple IPAs with lactose. This has a ton of flavor for being in a smaller package. There’s stone fruit, mainly a lot of white peach, with some more exotic vague juiciness, and more typical grapefruit and pine.

This is quite soft, but finishes pretty dry, and is very drinkable.

I really enjoyed this – it’s not exactly what Other Half does all the time."
3140,Luscious_Malfoy,Oyster,4.4,"poured from a 16oz can into a veil willi becher pint glass. pours a hazy orange with two fingers of soapy white foam head. citrus, tropical fruit, some resin and pine on the nose and taste. super flavorful hazy APA. thick mouthfeel. this thing packs a punch for 6%. incredibly drinkable. fairly complex with just as much fruit flavors and aromas as it has pine and dank weed."
3141,Sheppard,Oyster,3.85,Pours a pale hazy golden straw. Mango and grapefruit on the nose. Mango up front with some grapefruit peel. For a 6%er it is quite flavorful. A little bitter oaty malt on the finish. Not bad.

Name: Einstein's Duality
Brewery: Equilibrium Brewing
Location: Middletown, NY
Style: DIPA
ABV: 8.5%
Date: Unknown
First up on the review desk is a double IPA from Equilibrium. The container's label shows an Einstein with wild hair in some newspaper clipping. I notice the color first, charting around SRM 4, pale gold with light straw yellow. It is hazy and thick. The pour created a one-fingered bright white creamy, foamy head with decent retention. A slow dissipation left bits of lacing on the glass. I served it in a tulip glass at 44 degrees. I wanted to see a longer-lasting head, but the appearance is average overall. 
Nosing the glass, I smell pineapple, peaches, apricots, grass, lightly roasted malts, floral esters, and bread. 
The unique hop profile has orange peels, tangerines, floral ester, pineapple, peaches, apricots, and slight dank. As I was sipping this, I expected juicy hops but got something different. I am trying to figure out what to think about the hop profile. The malt backbone is firm yet soft; I taste crackers, bread, lightly toasted malts, and a bit dank. Looking for other flavors in the beer, I taste grass and a few yeast notes. 
The mouthfeel is astringent and finishes dry. The body is medium, and the carbonation is medium also. 
After sipping the beer several times, I am on the fence about this. The orange peel, apricot, and dry finish are somewhat abrasive. Nevertheless, it is a beer that I get to enjoy on this cloudy, drizzly night in Idaho."
3149,Whyteboar,Einstein's Duality,4.19,"Poured opaque raw honey color and was capped with a 1cm thick off white head that left amazing sheets of lacing down the glass.
The aroma was lost on my Covid affected nose.
The taste- I was expecting fruit galore as that is what NEIPAs are known for. And there was fruit, but dried fruits (think apricots and guava) with a tannin under tone. The dryness at the swallow, I think was meant to be the WC type bitter, or piney flavor. There was no piney flavor.
The feel was smooth and soft and almost juicy, but there was never a doubt that you were drinking a big beer.
OA, not sure I’d want one ever day but it is a really good beer."

Palate – 4.5 – Medium, creamy, soft but lively carbonation.
Final impression and summation: 4.25 Looks like used motor oil minus the sheen, very average for a RIS. The aromas and flavors duplicate each other and reinforce the sensory perceptions. The ethanol is totally hidden, making this dangerously quaffable. Damn good!"
3156,brewskis,Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.43,"Pours pitch black with a finger of dark mocha head. Aroma and taste giving off loads of roasted malt, peat, coffee grounds, dark chocolate, black cherry, prune, caramel, molasses, tobacco, drying oak tannin, significant bourbon, nice amount of vanilla. Low full body. Oily, sticky, silky. A gigantic beer that doesn't disappoint. Well done as expected."
3157,AlarmClock314,Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.52,"12oz bottle, package date of 11/17/21. Pours black with a very small sized brown head. Smells of bourbon, cocoa, vanilla, dark fruit, dark roasted malt, and earthy hops. The taste follows exactly. Good intensity and balanced flavors. Moderate bitterness and dryness in the finish. Above average body and low carbonation. Overall this is a great barrel aged RIS; strong yet smooth and drinkable."
3158,Mitchster,Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.38,"Many thanks to Erland for sharing this one. Pkgd 11/17/21. 13.4% ABV, 12oz bottle.
Pours out to a syrupy thick ink black, forming a thick dark cocoa head with average retention, sparse lacing. The nose is definitely full of bourbon but on top of that classic expedition nose we all love...prunes, dark chocolate, raisins, figs, soy sauce and black walnut. Mouthfeel is smooth and syrupy, dense bodied. Medium light carbonation, ~2.25 carbs or so. Taste is a recap of the nose. The bourbon is well balanced with the other complex stuff going on here and gives it a more warming presence that traditional Expedition. Bitterness is mild and earthy, hops are kept in check by copious malts. Considering the rich complex malts, there is no sourness or astringency here...this easily happens in lesser RIS's if the roasted malts are overdone. One is enough. It's a heavy hitter and very rich. This might be great over dark chocolate ice cream. Hrmmm. Might have to try that."
3159,Franziskaner,Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.27,Black in color with no light penetration. There's a fingernail of brown around the rim. The aroma is of piney hops and dark malt. I'm tasting piney hops and sweet bourbon. The mouth is thick and chewy.

3161,Z-Hoole,Hopslam Ale,4.69,"notes: pine and honey
very impressed with this"
3162,UWDAWG,Hopslam Ale,4.03,"Poured from a 12 ounce can with a best by date of 2-15-24 at 52 degrees in a snifter.

Look- Medium amber, very slight haze, light tan frothy head, above average head retention and lacing.

Smell- Biscuit, grapefruit, pine, honey, medium strength of scent.

Taste- Grapefruit, biscuit, honey, slight pine, moderately sweet, highly astringent, high strength of flavor.

Feel- Full body, slightly below average carbonation, highly creamy, highly bitter, slightly mouth warming, highly astringent.

Overall- The medium amber color was the first indication this was going to be a malt forward beer. The above average head retention and lacing helped to keep the look number at 4. The bouquet was definitely malt forward with grapefruit as a strong secondary aroma. The flavor was malt forward and pleasant right up until the astringency got in the way. The flavor rating would definitely have been higher without the astringency. The feel with full body and high creaminess was outstanding, but the astringency once again held my rating down by overshadowing the positive attributes. Overall this was a solid beer that was just too malt forward and astringent for my taste. I bet fifteen years ago this beer would have been mind blowing, but now it’s fairly average amongst the enormous available options."
3163,TwilightBeerCareer,Hopslam Ale,4.4,"Always stayed away from Hopslam because of the 10% abv. Was out and about today and it was on tap at the place I stopped, so I opted for just a taster. The alcohol is barely present, which was a surprise. A good malt backbone compliments the generous hopping. Well done. Not anything I would drink, but was glad to give it a try."

3165,jonhodges,Hopslam Ale,5,Best Beer to date.
3166,sjrider,Hopslam Ale,4.41,Can pour - clear orange/amber with foamy off white head leaving frosty lacing. Nose is sweet malt with a lot of resiny pine and hints of citrus. Taste follows with a bit of alcohol creep on the finish. A treat for hopheads.
3167,upsbeernut,Hopslam Ale,1.45,Well got a real bad batch with emphasis on drink by dates which really shouldn’t be allowed to use. That’s not an honest way to distribute beer cause of environmental affects that make the beer lose its taste. The average rookie consumer will not be able to judge to buy the beer or not. My two six packs were poured out and 40 bucks went down the drain too. Bought in November with the carton saying best by January 24 th. Guess what the bottom of the can revealed? January 2036. Now I haven’t a clue when it was canned. No recourse from Bells as I expected. Just another who cares.
3168,ClemsonMike,Hopslam Ale,4.56,"It seems as though Hopslam’s popularity has fallen off since its heyday about 15 years ago. This is not justified by the quality of this brew. This beer is as good as ever. Just purchased a few six packs of a 10/24 canned on date. Terrific balance of malt, hops, sweetness, and a bit of a booziness. I look forward to its release every year, now in October. This is a true classic and belongs in the beer Hall of Fame."
3169,Orca,Hopslam Ale,4.42,"12oz can (best by 1/3/2024, so packaged 10/3/2023) into a tulip. Pours a honey golden amber with a monstrous fluffy off-white head, nice clumpy lacing clings to the inside of the glass. 

Aroma is resinous and piney; sweet bready malt and I’d guess mostly Simcoe, Centennial, and Amarillo hops in abundance. Some grapefruit rind. 

Taste is a blast of sweet fruity malt and resinous, citrusy hops. Honey evident. Lots of pine, grapefruit, hop oils. Then more resin and pine. Some alcohol. Intense. This beer just grabs your palate by the throat and takes no prisoners. 

Mouthfeel is full-bodied, chewy, slick. Tongue-coating. Sticks with you. 

Overall I’d consider this a “statement” beer. It’s strong, bold, unapologetic. Still it manages to hold a tight balance between the solid malt bill and copious hops, so it’s clearly well crafted. Nicely done."
3170,EVH5150,Hopslam Ale,4.4,I always grab a few six packs of this legend when it comes out every January -ish. Seems much easier to find the past few years but absolutely a must try beer. I've always loved the faint taste and mouthfeel of honey hidden behind the massive hops and malt. One of the best beers i've ever had.
3171,Hobbs87,Hopslam Ale,4.48,Excellent DIPA. One of the best. Only drawback is that it has a pretty strong alcoholic aroma and taste which people may not prefer. Really good but just not quite in the same level as a Heady Topper or Pliny the Elder.
3172,nwalke16,Hopslam Ale,5,"This is the best Imperial IPA that I've had so far. 4.45/5 is too low. Firstly, the smell and taste is exactly what a West Coast Imperial IPA should taste like. The hops are complex and massive, but balanced with the malt and the sweetness. The overall taste is not like a 10% ABV beer, but tastes more like something that is 8%. I would really like to compare it to both Heady Topper and Pliny the Elder, but this is the best beer that Bells Brewery makes."
3173,beerwithmeIRL,Gueuze 100% Lambic,4.86,"750ml Bottle '20/21 - Pours an orange with golden hue and 2 finger cloud head that gradually dissapates. The aromas are simple incredible, a wonderful sour medley of vinegar, green apple, funk, wet hay. The taste is complex, a fabulous tartness balanced with sweet citrus fruit & zest. The sour apple & white wine vinegar are again magnified as the gueuze lingers. Outstanding doesn't do it justice. A top class example of gueuze."
3174,AzfromOz,Gueuze 100% Lambic,4.06,"Purchased at Nardi's Cellarbations in Geelong in August 20023. Drunk in December of that year.

In the glass, the beer tends towards copper. If I were unkind, I'd say it looks like a movie set fake beer apple cider, the kind they use to ensure actors don't turn into alcoholics while shooting endless retakes. A bubbly, bright-white head quickly disperses and leaves a thin covering atop the glass. Not helping the impression is that the beer looks thick, like there's gelatin in it, and the many large bubbles of carbonation moving slowly up the glass add weight to those thoughts. It has none of the sparkling joviality of a modern-day kettle sour; it doesn't look like a soda pour, and it doesn't effervesce like a Berliner Weisse. But it does look unique. L: 3.5

The nose is vinous, yeasty and tart, like sour crabapples or small, overripe grapes. A touch of farmyard and fermenting hay round things off. The tartness I smell hints at what's to come, and I raise the glass to my mouth ready to pucker my lips, squeeze my eyes shut and raise the hair on my neck, expecting the tartness to pull me into its tangy, zippy embrace. S: 3.75

As expected, the taste of sour apples, grapes and fermenting hay fills my mouth. They throw a brisk tartness at me, producing layers of salivation after each swallow, causing me to reach for another mouthful to stave off the wash of lactic acidity that rushes in with the saliva. Everything ends vinegary, a touch salty, and ever so dry. Swallowing this is like having a sour candy Warhead punch you in the mouth.

At first, it's too much, too heady, too tart, but somehow, eventually, it all works. Maybe I become numb to the tartness, or maybe it backs off as the beer warms, but as the shock wears off, I become a junky to the tangy hit that surges through me, and I can pick out the barnyard notes, the wet hay and the musty cobwebs that inhabit the beer's DNA. Its acidity has smoothed out, and there's a delicate balance - still sharply tart, mind - that is irresistible in its command that I drink more. Like any good junky, I give in to my cravings and eagerly down more of my new poison of choice. This is a big bottle, and seemingly without noticing, I've hit my stride and am drinking it far too quickly... T: 4.25

The mouthfeel matches the sharp acidity of the beer. Carbonation is medium, and carbonic prickle is low, but the beer snaps as you swallow it, like a cracked whip in your mouth. This is not a beer you can drink mindlessly; it simply won't let you. M: 4

A few mouthfuls in, I thought this beer would be a chore to drink. Halfway through, I realised I'd gotten there far quicker than I had thought. By the end, I wanted more of the vinegary, salty, sharp, smooth, acidic monster of a beer that it became.

This beer is a matter of acclimation, of letting go of the wheel and letting the beer drive. It's a masterful lesson in what makes a beer great: it challenges, it overcomes, and then it dominates the palate. This beer has an expert blender's loving hands guiding it to the Goldilocks Zone. In the end, it's neither too sour, too bracing or too barnyardy. It's juuuuuust right.

I grab Cantillon whenever I see it. It costs about a week's wages, but it's sometimes worth it. This is definitely one of those times. O: 4.25

Cheers!

This is Cantillon’s most popular beer, and I’m somehow only getting to it now. I was originally intending to just buy another bottle of Fou Foune from MBC, but when I saw the seller had this one available for a good price I figured I had to get it. Let’s pop it open and see what it has to offer

Pours a cloudy orange gold with 2 fingers of soapy off white head that quickly fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing

There's a lot of funk in the nose here, but it's very well integrated. i'm picking up on aromas of wet hay, sharp oak, lemon zest, wildflower honey, crabapple, white wine vinegar, white pepper, light cracker, and pear

The funk is certainly more aggressive in taste, though it's more than welcome here. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting lemon juice, earthy wheat, sharp oak, white wine vinegar, crabapple, pear skin, wet hay, jammy apricot, and white pepper. The swallow brings notes of lemon juice, wildflower honey, crabapple, sharp oak, white wine vinegar, pear skin, jammy apricot, earthy wheat, tobacco, light cracker, and a touch of smoke

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a sharp yet slick beer. Finishes oddly sticky but eventually dries out

This is wonderful, but I'm honestly a bit surprised that it's not super dry. The sticky finish takes away from the experience a bit, but overall it's still a great expereince"

3177,Hat_Fulla_Beer,Gueuze 100% Lambic,4.34,"750ml bottle poured into tulip. Date on bottle says December of '21.

Pours a deep golden orange with half a finger of dirty white head that leaves clouds of lace as it recedes.

Smells of white wine vinegar, sour green apples, zesty oranges, juicy stone fruit, barrel wood and some lacto funk.

Tastes more fruit-forward. Apricot, pineapple, sour apple, navel orange, more sharp vinegar, barnyard funk and barrel staves.

Feels smooth and delicate. Light bodied with soft carbonation. Finishes sour and fruity.

Verdict: Vigorously recommended. World class for sure."

3179,taxandbeerguy,Gueuze 100% Lambic,4.49,"2,500th review! It's only been 9.5 years. Super excited to try this legendary Cantillon as I've been sitting on it for a few months hoping for a milestone brew. 2021 bottling and purchased from Durand for a small but worthwhile fortune. My first Loon. Served cold into a goblet.

Appearance - Picturesque bright golden color with a small amount of haze. A finger of small soapy cap that continues to fizzle on as more head forms from the bubbles rising in the glass.

Smell - Tartness with subtle bits of cherry, apple skins, woody and slightly musty barrel, some earthy funk. There's sort of a deep underlying sweetness there too that ties all the aromas together.

Taste - A little sourness and green apple tartness. Elements of wood and musty barrel. Light grapey qualities too. Funky without being too far out in left field. Cohesive in the flavors. A slightly spicy element in the aftermath maybe. As it warms the woody barrel note seems to be elevated with a trace of honey. Depth of flavor is awesome and lingers on really well in the aftertaste,

Mouthfeel - Medium-light body, good expressive carbonation and very dry finish.

Overall - Awesome sour beer, the depth is unreal and it's difficult to decipher everything you're tasting. Super stoked to have finally tried this and boy does it ever live up to expectations. One of my best new beers of 2022 and a very worthy milestone brew. Absolutely worth trying if you can a) find it and b) afford it."
3180,perfumer,Gueuze 100% Lambic,4.49,"September 2021 bottle.

Looks: Slightly cloudy orange/gold, no head or legs.

Smells: Sour and funky, lots of fruit for an unfruited lambic (bacteria are amazing, hey?). I get apricot, orange zest, citron, green apple, pineapple, wood, a bit of bread, and apple cider vinegar levels of fermentation. 

Tastes: Similar to the nose but less fruity, mostly apricot, citrus, and green apple plus the woodiness and bready malt, with the sourness and funk being more prominent. Gave me a big initial pucker but was smooth after. 

Feels: Nice medium body, a slight fuzzy carbonation that doesn't linger very long.

Overall: Heck yeah. Awesome gueuze, lives up to the Cantillon hype even if it's not mind-blowing."

Aroma: Sour, tart, funky, musty, wet wood, green apple, grapefruit zest, with a touch of white grapes.

Taste: Sour, tart, slightly sweet, funky, oak, apricot, with some light lemon zesty notes.

Mouthfeel: Light to medium bodied with moderate carbonation.

More balanced, and smooth enough to allow for the fruit notes to come through. This is surprisingly mellow in the finish, with the bready notes of the yeast taking hold.

My first Cantillon offering, and shared with a couple friends at Monk's Cafe in Philly. Absolutely a must try for any beer enthusiast."

3187,Hobbs87,Temptation,2.58,"Have to call it as I see it. Just a terrible beer. I’ve had others from Russian River and this should be removed from their offerings. Figure they would have something based on a wine being in the Napa area but just had no enjoyable qualities at all. Most scores from BA have been somewhat accurate but a 98 for this is just stunning. Don’t waste your time or money, IMO this score is completely way off base."

Smell- White grape, oak, chardonnay, mildly brett.

Taste- White grape, chardonnay, sour finish.

Feel- Thin body, clean finish, very dry finish, sourness induces saliva, gentle carbonation.

Overall- A wild ale with an abundance of chardonnay characteristics. This is a large descent from the beer styles I typically drink, but was an enjoyable new experience."

Beer poured deep golden with a pretty good white head.

Nose is very nice, a nice combination of horse blanket, white wine, and a touch of sourness.

Taste follows the nose with a light but fairly substantial malt base that initially comes across as a sweet tart but has some funky leather. Finishes very dry and oaky.

Pours an opaque pale gold with a finger of white head that fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing

Oh man, this is super funky in the nose. I’m picking up on aromas of earthy white wine, wet hay, old leather, sharp oak, lemon juice, pear, apple skin, and light white pepper

The funk really keeps up in taste, it’s soft and delicate up front yet tart and funky on the finish. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting dry white wine, pear skin, white grape, smooth oak, and light apple. The swallow brings notes of earthy white wine, sharp oak, wet hay, clove, lemon juice, apple skin, and leather

3195,UWDAWG,Mother Of All Storms,4.59,"2020 vintage:

Poured from a 22 ounce bottle into a snifter.

Look- Ruby brown, sudsy medium brown head, opaque, visible particulate at edges, extremely below average head retention and lacing.

Smell- Toffee, bourbon, oak, vanilla, medium strength of scent.

Taste- Molasses, toffee, bourbon, oak, vanilla, boozy, sweet, very high strength of flavor.

Feel- Between medium and full body, highly mouth warming, low bitterness, boozy, below average carbonation, syrup like, mildly creamy, highly mouth coating, sweet.

Overall- Look was ruby brown with well below average head retention and lacing. Bouquet had a good mix of toffee, bourbon, oak and vanilla with medium strength. The flavors of this beer absolutely punched me in the mouth with strength. It had a very complex and pleasant flavor profile that showcased molasses, toffee, bourbon, oak and vanilla. The feel was also complex with plenty of mouth coating/warming properties that lead to a great consistency. Overall this beer provided a wonderful drinking experience."
3196,M-Fox24,Mother Of All Storms,4.31,"A: A deep to thickset tone on Raven per the decant, while highlighting an array on gunmetal, before addressing an old burgundy cast. Accompanied by, a blurredness that’s eased in the move(s) towards an above – serene – perspicuity. The nucleation is minimal over the discharge, which is principled to provide a shallow – tawny – collar, as the brim finely hems under the ¼ inch. Due to the fact, agitation is applied on the protected suds to encourage an engraving point on the quick/delicate webs, while viscosity offers slow-dripping fingers in strides

S: Malt sets the tone with an involved intensity, as the casks caress carefully. The recordings pursue surgarcane cola to offshoot Monin, while denoting toffee near buckwheat, aside the blackstrap qualities. Moreover, leathery raisins atop prunes and figs, which get fondued thru caramel, when the spices populate a foundation around anise at Cedrinca. Oak insinuations glean a durable popularity among tannin gifts, which is promoted at an hourly rate, while the frame administers/broadens the dry & sweet tones. In this sense, the barrel element proficiently addresses the lipids inside the wood, and conveys a hint to coconut, when advancing the oak stave presence. This movement also delivers a relaxed receptivity to acetates, as the barrel structure continually works alongside the malt facets. Here, a propensity to hammer in cherry cordials at a time allowing alertness, for televising complex polymers by vanillin. The ≥70°F step offers a civil charring on Kentish Huffkins, while smoky mountain taffy neighbors dried licorice roots. Successively, encircling parched fruits with a partiality on red, as tarry calfskins position an eternal cessation 

T: The culmination on hops is equitably masked, by the forbearing malt drivers. Chiefly, Golden Promise with wavering complexities behind Munich, Melanoidin, and Caramel. A profiling that delivers on strong, malty rich passages covering toasted nuts, besides honeycomb bread & a warming caramelization on Toffee Ettes. Even so, the hop impact does provide a calm bittering benefit to the malt(s) influence, while furthering the wooded subtexts ascribing the barrel(s) essence. Additionally, a lingering backend on citrus yields, for tackling sundried orange peels, just under the earthy herbs. The output is predominant on old-time molasses, which is utilized as a dried fruit coating per raisins + the arid state on plums via prunes, while assorted currants prospect below. In steps, a layer towards Cracked Cacao, by way of Hemicelluloses, which drives bourbon on cherry – cola – liquorice, before browning sugar to an inflamed comfort. Clocked sips include mulling the chalky tannins, from a medium platform, while insinuating camber wear along cherry oak baccy. Albeit, a softer density than the whiffs string along, yet a concealed growth that benefits the hour(s) accordingly. Those hours approach a pleasant aridness on neat cognac, for cuing a sophistication on bruised produce, while symbolizing an arson crime to old villas. An untarnished growth ≥ 4hrs/78°F, where the nuances lie in the wooded cask structure, seeing a thick phenolic aldehyde ad-lib. That is to say, an eugenol echo on stale wheat + English taffy, when delivering ancient shoe laces & beaten haversacks over bourbon, while pitching caramel on dead fruit. A cessation that shifts from a piped leaf to an unsealed/drenched dip, before remarking on the (scents) calfskin pull

M: A silky-smooth sharpness to the biting heat, which planes a late velvety mannerism. Nonetheless, a flammable presence that’s not so much forgiving in the later stages, yet a milky cooperation to keep warmth in check. The carbonation is neatly sawed-off to favor the underpinnings, where the conditioning frames to principally benefit. Notwithstanding, an attenuated tidiness to the dry reverberations 

O: Embodies the malts expertly, as the barrel perception grows to a more known maturity. Individually, a shadowed hop effect that nears neglection, in the bittering application. That effect is not a complete afterthought, considering the aids to kick the tannin derived postscripts: the coriaceous dry tailpieces"

3200,jmdrpi,Mother Of All Storms,4.67,"500 ml bottle, 2021 release. Poured into snifter glass at cellar temperature. 

Pours very dark chesnut brown with some garnet highlights. Thick tan colored head. Pretty good head retention. Wonderful aroma of soft oak, rich boozy vanilla, toffee, and caramel. Maybe a touch of fig. Similarly complex taste, not too sweet, and some warming alcohol in the finish. Smooth mouthfeel with a sticky finish."

Look- Pale straw, very hazy, opaque, no visible particulate, white creamy head, slightly above average head retention and lacing.

Smell- Passionfruit, white grape, clementine, pith, medium strength of scent.

Taste- Clementine, pith, passionfruit, white grape, between medium and high strength of flavor.

Feel- Full body, average carbonation, moderately bitter, highly creamy, mildly dry finish, very low astringency.

Overall- Had not seen this beer in the area in quite some time. This one had great appearance. The bouquet was very pleasant and would have been next level if it had been slightly stronger. Flavors and feel were both really good. This beer was very pleasurable to drink and when you factor in the great price for a six pack it is hard to beat."
3203,vgg925,Nelson,4.85,"Such a tasty beer. A 6-pack for $9.99 is a steal IMO. Love the characteristic Nelson love bite on the tongue. Piney but not full-on resinous. Great, long flavor, with a nice tickle in the roof of the mouth that lasts for a bit longer than expected. First-class IPA, would be one of the first I hit upon opening the community ice chest."
3204,AZgman,Nelson,4.47,"A really flavorful and drinkable beer. I love Nelson hops so I am biased I guess, but I would think most people would like this beer if they tried it. Pours slightly hazy with a frothy but low density, head. 7% ABV but it does not taste alcoholic. Some have complained that this is not the beer it used to be, but who cares? It is plenty good!"

This is an excellent IPA. The New Zealand hops added some floral bitterness with hints of white wine grapes.

Taste is dry, with flavors of citrus, tropical, and floral. Rye at the end. Low bitterness and a balancing sweetness.
Medium mouth feel. Crispiness in the mouth. Good carbonation.
Tasty and totally quaffable."
3208,Rug,Nelson,4.16,"So, what do we have here? A once legendary beer that has (allegedly) been bastardized beyond recognition. This was a long time want for me before I knew the whole story of it, and ultimately ended up forgetting about it. However, when I saw it on Tavour I figured it was at least worth a shot. Let's crack it open and see if it's really as bad as some say

Pours a hazy pale yellow with 3 fingers of soapy off white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves minimal lacing

The nose is quite vibrant here, I'm not really understanding the complaints yet. I'm picking up on aromas of red grapefruit, gooseberry, grassy hops, rye bread, white pepper, orange zest, light papaya, and white grape

It's a bit less balanced in taste for sure, focusing more on the bitterness, but it's still damn good. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting gooseberry, earthy hops, lemon zest, rye bread, grass, overripe cantaloupe, and light weed. The swallow brings notes of rye bread, earthy hops, black pepper, lemon zest, papaya, pithy grapefruit, light papaya, and dank weed

A light medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a snappy beer. Finishes mostly dry with a firm bitterness to keep things refreshing

Maybe drinking this through the lens of not having had the original invalidates my opinion, but I don't really care. This isn't perfect, but a damn good IPA as is"
3209,VashonGuy,Nelson,3.79,"I first rated Alpine's Nelson in 2015, and gave it a 4.41 average rating. It's been the third highest of all the IPAs I've rated over the years, not quite 200.

In those early years (2014-2015), I had Nelson on tap a few times. It was uncommon in Seattle, but always a treat.

Well, now I've had Nelson in cans, and I guess it's the ""new Nelson"". I've read about some of the behind the scenes stuff on who's made it. I don't know the whole story, but I do know that the beer I just had in a six pack is nothing too special. It's nowhere near what I remember of the once ethereal beer. So I deleted my old rating, as it no longer applies. This is a new rating/review, as of July 2023.

Nelson looks gorgeous, big fluffy white head, and golden color. The smell is piney. It's a little out of the ordinary for a 2023 beer, as it's not a citrus bomb (grapefruit), like Pliny, and it's also a long way from the fruity hazy taste profiles of NE IPAs. It's kind of old school, which I like. However, the rye character has pretty much gone missing, and the Nelson Sauvin hop profile isn't nearly as good as I remembered. Fortunately, it's still got a solid bitterness to it.

I guess I'm just pining for the OG."
3210,daliandragon,Nelson,4.23,"Found this on Friday while returning from some hiking and stopped at Total Wine on the way back to the Old Line State. This is obviously a beer that needs no introduction and I wasn't sure if it was available on the east coast. Opaque, ultra yellow body like a latter day hazy IPA but the nose is more familiar citrus and grapefruit lending towards pine but still fruity. 

The flavor is unique; very dry at the outset, it seems pretty subtle but continues to develop and deliver throughout the aftertaste. High carbonation also hides flavor in the early stages before revealing grapeskin, bread, bubble gum, melon, and finally, the promised rye. Really nice, luxurious mouthfeel is a highlight as well. I did not love the start, but this one grew on me."

3212,mkh012,Nelson,4.3,"A classic that I understand has changed throughout the years. Sampled on tap. Hazy orange with notes of citrus, white grape, lemon, bubblegum, bread crust, and weed, on both the nose and taste. Low to medium bitterness with a medium mouthfeel and carb. A textbook, well-executed Nelson profile. White grape aftertaste. Very good. Each category is pushing 4.5 for me, so I give this a 4.5 overall."

Consumed: Jan. 8, 2021
Misc.: Bottled on Sept. 16, 2015 

Picked this up from someone from a San Diego beer trading group when he was trying to get rid of some stuff. Bought this one for $15 and another for $10. The main reason I bought this one was that I had it twice before, giving each taster a 4.25 on Untappd (Nov. 8, 2015 and Feb. 12, 2016) at The Bruery in Placentia, Calif. Online description I found read “Mélange #3 is a blend of three bourbon barrel aged strong ales. White Oak Sap, a wheat wine, our Anniversary Series old ale and our imperial Stout, Black Tuesday, join forces in this luxurious strong ale that links some of the best characteristics of each of the contributing beers. Chocolate, dark fruits, oaky vanilla and rich toffee-like character reach through the bourbon veneer for an intensely satisfying quaff.”

Poured a very dark color with two fingers of frothy khaki-tan frothy head. Calm setting underneath with no noticeable head. Below average watery lacing. Bad retention. (Sight - 3.25)

Smelled leathery oak, boozy bourbon, crayon, caramel, toffee, milk chocolate, brown sugar, maple syrup, sticky molasses, dark fruit, date, cocoa and hints of coconut. Was getting most of that 17.3 pct. ABV. Much smoother out of the bottle. Got so much better as it went down. Crazy because probably started at a 4 and moved to a 4.5. (Smell - 4.25)

Unlike the nose, the taste was nowhere near 17.3 pct. ABV. Got chewy caramel, toffee, leathery oak, milk chocolate, brown sugar, maple syrup, vanilla, sticky molasses, smooth bourbon, chocolate syrup, cocoa and some coconut. (Taste - 4.50)

Full body. Sticky texture. Soft carbonation. Long, smooth, warming finish. (Feel - 4.75)

Just another solid offering from The Bruery. Excellent. (Overall - 4.25)

3217,DvdP,Mélange No. 3,4.46,"Pours cloudy dark brown, some carbonation. Smells heavy bourbon, oak. Thick, heavy, some boozyness but normal Bruery-level, warming. Taste is tobacco-herbal barrel, umami, rich."
3218,DokiDokiLitFam,Mélange No. 3,4.65,"Bottled on 2/02/17 This one has done some hard time. Nearly 4 years.

Pours a thick looking dark brown. This looks like chocolate pudding not only in color but in density. No light penetration whatsoever. A finger of smooth looking khaki head appears on an aggressive pour. Then fades on the quicker side.

Nose is bourbon for days. I'm just a sucker for this sort of thing. Bourbon, toffee, caramel, butterscotch, and other words you associate with sweet confectionery decadence. Taking a whiff of this, some might be able to guess it sits at the high side of the ABV spectrum. But for 16% this covers it well. 

Taste follows to a tee. Smooth caramel and butterscotch introduced by a brief impact of bourbon and followed up by the effervescent quality of booze evaporating on your tongue. I'm not sure if I get any stout presence at all. No roasty malt appears, but for a brew pushing four years, it makes sense.

Mouthfeel is full-bodied and creamy. Smooth and rich. Carbonation still present which is nice to see. Very calm bubbles. Of course the sheer volume of alcohol creates a drying quality that does a solid job of contesting any sort of cloying from the sweetness.

Overall this brew is heavy handed, but absolutely delicious. Time may have made this one a touch linear or removed the nuance, but personally there is no way for me to know. This is a dessert, a treat, pure unabashed and unashamed decadence. Share this with friends. Or if you don't have any, share it with enemies and they will ally with you in no time."

T: Tasted of a decent amount of dark fruit (raisins, plums, in particular), a little bit of citrus fruit (orange, in particular). a good shot of bourbon (not overdone ), a tinge of caramel (quite sweet, but not cloyingly so), and a woody quality.

I cannot believe that I have made it to 1400, on my way to 1500. The beer is from 2017. The temperature of the beer is 55 degrees. The pour of the beer produced a one-fingered creamy and billowy head. The beer's head retention is average. The color of the beer is a light tan head. The color of the beer is SRM 16, a medium-dark brown with reddish hues. This beer is beautiful. 

The initial aromas in the beer are bourbon, alcohol, toasted malts, caramel, molasses, toffee, raisins, oranges, leather, tobacco, oak, resin, floral esters, burnt sugar, a touch of herbal, and bready. 

The flavors in the beer are bourbon, alcohol, toasted, malts, raisins, figs, leather, wheat, caramel, molasses, toffee, raisins, oranges, tobacco, oak, resin, floral esters, burnt sugar, earthy, bready, and a touch of solvent. 

The mouthfeel of the beer is warming and chewy. 

The body of the beer is full, medium carbonation, and a full finish. 

This beer is incredible. The blend they achieved in this beer is nearly perfect. The beer has depth and flavors are harmonious. This beer is deserving of this review. I wanted an impressive beer to celebrate 1400, and that is what I got. Phenomenal beer."

Feel is out of this world, despite being nearly 17% abv there's no hint of booziness, absolutely zero oxidation, and the low carbonation provides a chewy and sticky mouthfeel. Yet another hit from the Bruery, and at 7 years old it's a real treat."

3226,Saluki,Rodenbach Alexander,4.44,"From a bottle to a frozen stemless wine glass. Couldn't decode the date label.

For what it is, it is a very good tasty beer. Head lasts nicely. Lots of flavors, predominantly the cherries of course, ale almost an after thought. Not sure I could taste the oak foeder, but it is very smooth which I guess is the point. Following up with a lesser beer highlights all this and makes it better than it would be on its own. Three more to go, one at a time is enough.

If you don't like sours, or cherries, or have a great curiosity for beers, take a pass. Overpriced."
3227,thehyperduck,Rodenbach Alexander,4.22,"750 mL corked & caged bottle from the LCBO; best before 03/01/2021 and served slightly chilled.

Pours a clear, purplish burgundy colour, shining ruby red when held to the light. Less than a finger of frothy, off white-coloured head fizzles within ninety seconds or so, soon reduced to a sickly thin collar and an islet of film on the surface. The aroma is a fragrant blend of balsamic, red wine vinegar, sour cherries, oak and mild barnyard funk, with further suggestions of cherry juice, cranberry and vanilla.

Fruity at the forefront, with black cherry sweetness giving way to red wine, balsamic vinegar and sour cherries by mid-sip. Notes of vanilla, oak, cherry juice and mild funk develop on the tail end, with mild wine vinegar acidity, cherry pit and sour cherries lingering into the aftertaste. Not particularly funky, at least not by Rodenbach standards. Light-medium in body, with average carbonation that rolls across the tongue, supplying a light frothiness to this brew's smooth, soft mouthfeel. Regular imbibers of Rodenbach, as well as kriek enthusiasts, should be able to finish this bottle themselves without too much trouble, but it's always better to share.

Final Grade: 4.22, an A-. Alexander strikes me as a mellower, lighter, less complex version of their Caractère Rouge, which is clearly the superior product IMO. On the other hand, Alexander's cherry flavours do pop quite nicely, making for a surprisingly refreshing pick on this cool, late summer evening. A poor cellaring candidate, especially compared to most of Rodenbach's other beers, but it does seem to hold up OK in the short-term (i.e. 3 years or less). A genuinely solid red ale - much like Caractère Rouge, I think this would serve quite well as an introduction to Flemish reds."
3228,journey-of-beer,Rodenbach Alexander,4.65,"Look: Moderately hazy reddish-brown hue with a thick, cream-colored head with just a hint of pinkish red. Fairly significant lacing and a very slow dissipation to the head.

Smell: It has that red wine-esque aroma that all of the truly great Flanders red ales have. There's a minor hint of fruit, but the aroma is dominated by the ale itself.

Taste: The excellent quality Flanders red ale dominates up-front. Taste of malt, oak, red wine vinegar, plus that distinctive Flanders red taste that is hard to pin down in words. The sour cherry starts to become apparent next, with a lingering sweet cherry on the aftertaste. The lingering sweet cherry is surprising and pushes right up to the edge of being too much like cough syrup, but it never quite crosses the line and gives this a truly unique and distinctive taste. Both the sour and sweet cherry become more apparent as the beer warms.

Feel: fairly highly carbonated, light body overall.

Overall: There's a reason this is a world-class beer. The ale itself is truly top notch, but what pushes this over the edge is the unique blend of sour and sweet cherry that I have never encountered in any other beer I've tried."

Taste: Lightly sour, sweet, cherry, strawberry, oak, and fruit vinegar.

Mouthfeel: Light to medium bodied with moderate carbonation.

Overall: Good enjoyable aroma and flavours that is balanced and very fruity. My preference is still Caractère Rouge though."

Lots of cherry flavors."
3232,flagmantho,Rodenbach Alexander,4.42,"Poured from 330mL bottle into my BeerAdvocate teku.

Appearance: rich amber-ruby hue with a clear body and a thin layer of frothy foam that is perhaps light tan with a hint of pink. Pretty!

Smell: rich aroma with a hint of sourness and wonderful cherry character. It's just sweet enough to be very candylike; I'm super duper into it.

Taste: holy cow, it's even more candylike than the aroma! The extra tartness in the flavor, combined with the sweetness and cherry, give almost a Jolly Rancher like character to this thing. That said, there's definitely malt underneath the candy. Is there such a thing as *too* much candy in a beer like this? I am not sure, but if there is, this might be approaching it. Still -- very good indeed.

Mouthfeel: medium body with a nice carbonation and a good creaminess. It comes together well.

Overall: I mean, this beer is definitely my speed. I love cherry and I love Flemish beers, so really this ticks a lot of boxes for me. It's extremely good, but I want to say it's almost too much even for me. So, excellent, if not transcendent."
3233,Roy_Hobbs,Bourbon Barrel-Aged Barley Wine,4.16,"2018 vintage. 

Before I even take a sip, we're off to a very good start as this beer both looks and smells fantastic. Barleywines don't often jump out at me appearance wise, but I find this beer to be very attractive. More head than I anticipated, and the pour had a beautiful shade of bright reddish brown. Not to be outdone, the aroma takes it up a notch. Loads of rich caramel notes with the bourbon barrel adding a nice dimension. 

The quality of this doesn't drop off in the taste department. Rich caramel malts lead the way, but it's the nuance from the bourbon that I'm really enjoying. Jut enough vanilla and wood to make this interesting. Fairly light bodied for the ABV. 

Overall, very tasty."

3235,jrc1093,Bourbon Barrel-Aged Barley Wine,4.25,"2018 vintage; consumed on 1/11/22

Pours a clear jet-crimson body with sharp, blood-red highlights and topped with a finger and a half of creamy, pale beige foam; sub-par head retention fades to a few spotty, paper-thin islands of cap, a large, frothy collar, and no lacing clinging to the walls of the glass.

Aromas of harsh, ripe whiskey breed burnt sugar, smoked butterscotch and caramel, and a decadent prune/plum compote; shreds of whiskey umami and soy varnish make way for floral oak barrel carrying vanilla icing against potent bourbon lingering as a final impressor.

Taste shows burnt sugar and toffee swirled into fig syrup upfront, with plummy esters lingering through the mid-palate to a bourbon back end, leaving a dusting of cocoa to finish.

Mouthfeel offers a medium body with minimal carbonation and a semi-oily viscosity, maintaining a slickness into the mid-palate; a char is intertwined in a mild, tannic twang with incredible subtlety on the back end of the palate, where a piercing, encompassing warmth peaks into the finish.

Cresting at the potent richness of boozy barrel peaks, ascendant dark fruit jams near umami status against an unrelenting spirit and fresh oak barrel interplay; structure and detail at the highest levels of barleywine."
3236,JohnnyHopps,Bourbon Barrel-Aged Barley Wine,4.71,"For purposes of this review, the 2014 vintage was sampled. 

Appearance - The beer poured a rusty red color with a few white bubbles crowning the top of the glass. 

Smell - The nose was a sweet bready barleywine, with hints of bourbon. This pretty much nailed the expectation. 

Taste - The profile had the appropriate level of sweetness. There were notes of raisin, tobacco, orange rind, big caramel, and a nice mild alcohol burn at the finish. 

Mouthfeel - The feel was smooth, almost slick with carbonation largely faded. 

Overall - This is fairly old school, but it is still elite."
3237,Vidblain,Bourbon Barrel-Aged Barley Wine,4.63,"Vintage 2018 - quite low carb, which really accentuates the rich, oily body of the beer. There is a ton of thick caramel to the beer - sweet, but nicely balanced by malt and hops. Smooth, zero trace of the ABV, with a surprisingly clean finish.

Sofa king good. Highly recommended."

3246,Hephaistos,Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,4.41,"500ml bottle, 5,4% abv, pooured in a classic Weihenstephaner glass. Nice hazey amber colour, small bubble carbonation, 2-3 finger off white head dense foam. Smelling like banana, some yanginess sweetness coming through, little bit of burnt caramel.
Smooth mouthfeel, very balanced taste, not too sweet, bit of acidity and spices from the yeast, liitle bit of hoppy biterness in the aftertaste.
For me the best HefeWeissbier known to me."

3249,NCSapiens,Péché Mortel,4.27,"Understated, smooth, a bit of chocolate and char roast malts, coffee, very well rounded and tastes great without a bunch of adjuncts."
3250,woemad,Péché Mortel,3.49,"11.5oz bottle purchased at Community Pint, in Spokane, WA. According to the stamp on the rear level, this was bottled on February 23, 2022. Different label than what is shown here.

Poured into a snifter, this was the color of darkest night, with a thin tan head that did not stick around for very long.

Nose was initially of coffee and molasses. As it warmed, there was an aroma similar to cinnamon that stepped up to the plate.

Very understated. Vaguely coffeeish and cinnamon flavor, but the coffee was really quite muted. Apart from that, just a vaguely roasty malt flavor was present. Bitter coffee flavor at the swallow.

Fairly light bodied for an imperial stout. Kinda watery, really.

I'm not a fan. Maybe this is too old, maybe it was abused by whatever distributor brought it to Community Pint (I'm familiar enough with them to know they store beer well), but I also recall the two other beers I've had from Dieu du Ciel also turned out similarly when I got a chance to try them. Maybe I'm just not on their wavelength, or they're not on mine. I think I'm done trying their beers, short of actually going to Montreal and trying them at the source. Disappointing."
3251,Mysticmage,Péché Mortel,4.21,"Finally got to try this top ranked beer in Canada. Does it live up to it’s rep. Lets find out.the pour is indeed thick and black with a coffee collar that stayed for a bit. Nose is coffee roasted goodness with chocolate underlay. Taste is similar with roasted coffee upfront and boozy finish. Feel is light surprisingly, not as much body as I was expecting. Look, it’s good but do think some brewers in Canada have come up with comparables. Rorshach comes to mind as does flying monkeys attempts and third moon. This one has been around for ages and so its reputation has built, but I do feel Ontario can now match it’s prowess."
3252,jngls,Péché Mortel,4.33,"One year old. Can to snifter.

L: Pours pitch black with a light brown head that leaves a bit of lacing. A couple of very fine floaters visible.

S: Coffee, cocoa, dark chocolate and vanilla. Dark and smoky with some sweet hints.

T: Dark and malty with notes of coffee and dark chocolate complemented by some smoky hints. Minimal sweetness. Very bitter.

F: Smooth and creamy on the one side. Rather light bodied and drinkable on the other side. Medium carbonation.

O: Very good no-bullshit coffee stout with a classic flavor profile. Drinks very smoothly, but could be a bit thicker. Works great, even without any barrel aging."
3253,harrypowers,Péché Mortel,4.35,"Pours a dark brown/black with a 1F tan head and moderate lacing.

Smells of coffee, chocolate and caramel.

Tastes of toasted malt, dark chocolate, mildly bitter coffee , caramel and vanilla with a mildly bitter boozy warm finish.

Medium heavy body with light carbonation. Lush syrupy mouthfeel.

This is a well made, very strong and complex sipper. It's at its most bitter just out of the refrigerator and gets sweeter and mellower as it warms."

3255,dano213,Péché Mortel,3.98,"11.5oz can received as a gift from a friend. Batch number 69. I emailed the brewery to ask when this was bottled. They said approximately 2013-10-17, so this beer is almost 9 1/2 years old! Interesting and surprising fact - this is a screw-off bottle cap!

Look: This beer is quite dark (black with brown highlights) but doesn't appear to be so thick. There is a very thin tan-colored head around the rim of the glass.

Smell: Nice roasted malt, coffee, and chocolate aromas. A bit of fruitiness and lots of booze. Slightly reminiscent of chocolate covered cherry cordials.

Taste: It's tasty. For me, this has the right amount of sweetness and bitterness. Up front, it's very roasty and a bit fruity, somewhat sweet. The finish is initially mildly sweet, and then gradually shifts to a full-on bitter, chocolatey and coffee-laden finish.

Feel: It's on the thin side for an Imperial Stout, I would call this medium bodied or perhaps medium plus. Appropriately carbonated - not too much carbonation and not too little either. As I take my time to sip on this, it's not nearly as enjoyable as it loses its carbonation.

Overall: It's a very solid coffee Imperial Stout. I had this beer once before either at a bottle share or at home over 15 years ago. I remember being extremely impressed with it then. I'm not so taken with this beer now. I'm not sure if it's because this bottle has a lot of age on it, or because the bar has been raised for coffee stouts and craft beer in general over time. I think that this is not getting a fair shake due to age. Either way, this aged bottle is good (not amazing in my opinion). Then again, my review needs to be taken in consideration given that this bottle is old and that a fresh bottle will undoubtedly taste different and probably a lot better."
3256,BitteNochEinWeissbier,Péché Mortel,4.44,"11.5oz bottle
Bottled Date: 2021-08-12
Consumed on: 17 Feb, 2023
Glass: Snifter
ABV: 9.5 %
Serving Temp: room temp


Look: 
Thick black with a 1-finger creamy light brown head. The head is slow to dissipate and leaves awesome lacing along the glass.

Smell: 
Lightly sweetened medium to light roast coffee. Bittersweet chocolate. Notes of vanilla and a touch of oak. The vanilla makes the brew smell like it has some cream or more accurately creamer (good creamer) in it. A faint wisp of smoke can be detected if one tries.

Taste: 
Wonderfully balanced sweetened medium-roast coffee with a touch of cream and bittersweet chocolate. A nice earthy bitterness is present but is part of the coffee and does not overwhelm. The sip finishes spicy, a bit bitter, but also a touch sweet. Smokiness shows up in the aftertaste.

Feel: 
Smooth and viscous. Some late warmth from the alcohol. The body is medium with a step to the thin side.

Overall: 
An excellent Imperial Coffee Stout. Nicely complex, very tasty, and surprisingly drinkable. The only knock to the brew is its thinner-than-expected body. But that's my issue, not the beer's.

If you like coffee and/or coffee stouts, pick this up and give it a try."
3257,cag_3939,Péché Mortel,5,"To be fair I’ve been drinking Peche Mortel for about 12 years. Over the years I’ve had some great beers but this is the only one I’m willing to buy online to make sure I have it readily in stock. 
It pours nearly black with a half finger of creamy, hazelnut-colored head.
The smell let’s you know what kind of a ride you are about to enjoy. A punch of roasted coffee comes first, followed by dark chocolate, dark fruits, leather and tobacco smoke.
The taste follows the nose with each aspect getting to shine as the beer warms. Coffee roast, dark chocolate are front and center with some subtle dark fruitiness giving way to a leather and ash finish. All are well balanced. 
The mouthfeel is creamy with a moderate carbonation but isn't overly boozy for 9.5% ABV.
To this day the best beer I’ve ever had."
3258,MikeWard,Péché Mortel,4.2,"11.5oz bottle into a pint glass. Bottled 3/2015, so 7 years old.

Black body, small tan head doesn't last long but leaves a light spider's web of lacing.

Aroma is nicely of coffee.

On tasting, strong coffee flavor, smooth, lightly sweet, some warmth from the abv.

Mouth above medium, finish coffee with a faint roasted malt.

Overall, impressed that 7 years in the bottle doesn't diminish the coffee. Unless a fresh one is an outright coffee bomb."
3259,dbl_delta,Péché Mortel,3.99,"2015 vintage; growler into pint glass. Pours essentially black with no head. Initial impression is roasted malts, dark choclate, and coffee grounds.

Too much. Doesn't taste like beer with coffee, tastes like coffee with carbonation. Overpowering. 
Not to my liking."
3263,Sparty1965,Dreadnaught,4.01,I dig it but a little too bitter. And I’m a little too bitter.
3264,ommegangpbr,Dreadnaught,4.17,"I remember, once upon a time, when this was the highest rated double IPA on beeradvocate and I could not get it in my area. Much time has passed and I am really grateful I can now get this beer where I live.
16 ounce can, 3/17/2023 born on date; I imagine this would be even more impressive when sampled closer to the born on date but it's still a pretty fresh sample.
Fruit flavors are pineapple and peach. Alcohol is very well concealed. This is a sweet and juicy sample of the style. I prefer crisper versions but if I see this on tap I'm going for it."
3265,Dimagio,Dreadnaught,4.65,Best ipa I've had yet...
3266,LiquidAmber,Dreadnaught,4.42,"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a medium to dark coppery amber with a three finger white head with great retention and solid lacing, looks nice. Aroma of biscuit malt, citrus hops, lemon, orange, grapefruit and some dankness. Flavor is biscuit and light dry caramel malt, citrus and piney hops, grapefruit, orange, pine, mild mixed tropical fruit, a little rye; resinous pine and citrus rind finish with great alpha oil bitterness. Medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess. Glad to finally try something from this venerable brewery and I'm glad I started with this. Getting an IPA from the Midwest that has substantial bitterness is a joy in this hazy age and this is one solid IPA. The malt is somewhat old fashioned with good biscuit notes, but the hops are classic NW IPA, which is my favorite profile. Lots going on here and quite enjoyable. This IPA has been off my radar, I'm going to try to snag a Gumball Head next, one of my favorite ale names. Looks, smells and tastes great."
3267,Papercut4,Dreadnaught,4.35,"Pours out of the can a gently hazy deep copper with a nice two finger white head and great retention. Laaaazy bubbles up the side of the glass. Smells piney, resinous, and like ripe citrus. Tastes leans heavier on the pine and resin and hits you a bit with the alcohol. I think on the third sip I was starting to find the malt notes that are advertised on the can. If I'm honest, it's really well done, but the alcohol is a tad bit distracting from the overall flavor, but not enough to bring its score down too bad. It's a robust mouthfeel and is carbonated expertly. Glad I got to try this old school imperial that I've heard was a game changer years ago."
3268,JohnniEMc,Dreadnaught,4.43,"From a tap, delivered inside a clear pint glass it came. It's beautifully and brightly copper-amber with a very modest off-white head. The aroma, although not pronounced, brings IPA hops and malt. There's a little too much alcohol to taste to keep it from excellence, but the ABV is 9.4, for goodness sake. The malt body is rich and up to carrying the hops and most of the alcohol. As it should be the hops, both citrusy and earthy, dominate the outstanding taste."
3269,cjeep,Dreadnaught,4.5,"Special stuff from a special outfit.
L: from the canon McCann is very stylish and somewhat psychedelic.
S: big citrus hoppy aroma. Simply delicious.
T: just awesome and special. The bitterness is almost overwhelming at times. All kinds of happy goodness flavors lotta citrus pine.
F: smooth and rich.
O: this is a terrific beer and I’m always thrilled when I find it."

Sweeter than I'd like, lots of rich, caramelly malt, citrus, especially grapefruit and orange, some pineapple and mango flavors. Hints of pine 
Medium-heavy bodied with appropriate carbonation, slightly cloying
Heavy, syrupy bodied keeps this from being drinkable, but otherwise, exemplary"
3271,dano213,Dreadnaught,3.79,"16oz can purchased from the fridge as a single for $4.89. Canned on 3/17/23, so this is five weeks and a day old.

Look: It pours out a very nice light orange amber color with very tiny floaties. The two fingers of rocky, beige-colored head slowly dissipated. Looks like a nice Imperial IPA.

Smell: It smells super piney along with a bit of citrus notes. I get orange peel and some pepper. There's also some sweet malt notes and some boozy bubble gum notes. For a beer that is this big, the nose is underwhelming.

Taste: This is a huge Imperial IPA. At 9.4% ABV, it really does not taste nearly as strong as it is. It's dangerously drinkable and it's actually somewhat balanced. Up front, it's malty and sweet for a very short time before the hop bitterness takes over. The finish is very bitter and earthy with huge pine notes and grapefruit peel and it lingers super long. Eventually, orange peel and caramel/crystal notes come forward after the bitter hop resins fade from the front of the palate. After pouring the bottom of the can, the body improved a bit but the taste also became slightly chalkier.

Feel: It's medium plus bodied with a nice chewy, slick, and slightly oily mouthfeel.

Overall: This is definitely a solid Imperial IPA. I can appreciate this beer, but it's not really my personal preference to go seeking this out again. I may have had it many years ago via Beer Trade, but at that time I was just looking to seek out the ""big beers"" that were highly rated and I may not have even had an Imperial IPA before, so it was worth trying again.

From the can:
An Imperial India Pale Ale with an intense citrus hop aroma, a huge malt body AND a crisp finish."
3272,HattedClassic,Oude Geuze,4.35,"The beer pours a nice white and lightly foaming head that dissipates quickly while the beer itself is a clear light orange color.

The smell is pretty good. It has a light apricot tartness to it with a rustic grain note and a tiny honey sweetness hidden underneath all of them.

The taste is wonderful. It has a wonderful apricot tartness with a subdued malt note underneath it and rustic smell as well.

The feel is pretty good. It has a light body with tickling carbonation and a dry finish. The acidity is fairly low.

Overall, this a really good beer to spend drinking the afternoon with."

Appearance: medium golden hue with a light haze and a frothy but low head of ivory foam. Pretty.

Smell: a lovely and balanced combination of sweet, tart, and earthy. It has kind of a ""savory candy"" thing going on; it's really great.

Taste: bright and just a bit tart, with a subdued sweetness and a good, earthy maltiness. It many not be super complex, but it is very, very good.

Mouthfeel: light body with a light carbonation and a refreshing fizziness. Never having had this before, I don't know if that's typical for Oude Geuze; when I popped the cork it didn't seem super carbonated.

Overall: a delicious and refreshing tasty treat on this warm summer day. Very glad I snagged myself a bottle of this."

L: mildly-hazy, yellow-orange colored liquid; messy cap persists after initial pad decay... laces a little; looks dirty near murky

S: textbook: nutty lemon, rainy spring day, smutty penny, hints of rustic white bread and apple cider vinegar... the nutty breadiness increases as it aerates... peppery, onion spicy; note of sweat

T: green grassy earthiness lighting up front of palate; moderate cider-lemon brightness in the bottom-back of the palate... this morning it's still raining, and this perfectly compliments the aromas... aftertaste dry, vaguely bready, with the nuttiness of a mother... the finish has a lovely length and intensity

F: satiny spread, tingly tang, mineral twinge and parch... wheated bounce up front, sticky funk smearing, acid ting numbing the backs of my teeth, roof of my mouth... my sinuses are opening, view brightening... longing for more goat-licking sticky... textures/body seem broader, more bracing than other brands

O: a travesty I never tried this before; of course, I've hesitated getting their other brands, due to cost, and seeing myself getting carried away... might be my new go-to, when I get that hankering; solid. (2138)"
3277,mehollin,Oude Geuze,4.5,Took me back to Belgium at my first taste.
3278,cjgiant,Oude Geuze,4.29,"Fairly clear pour at first, it turned a little hazy as I could not properly leave out some of the stuff at the bottom of the bottle. There isn't much head to talk of, but a thin collar of bubbles shows it isn't a still beer. The nose is my favorite part, with a lemon spritzed tart nectarine impression with an slight cider vinegar edge and some light funky cheese. Combine those more acidic notes with backup scent of light cereal malt and even lighter herbal components.

On the lighter side with the mix of tangy sour and micro-carbonation leavening things. The taste isn't quite as complex as the nose, with a bit more of a herbaceous bitterness than I expected, at least relative to the tartness. The beer has an acidic component that pairs with this, for sure, but on my tongue, it seems to go for the sides while the lightly herbal wood tannin note takes up the middle. As it warms, the sour level slowly increases, pushing the more bitter aspect further back on my palate.

I loved the nose, and my enjoyment of the taste increased as I sipped. Glad to finally get to review this."
3279,LeBron_James,Oude Geuze,4.6,"Pours a straw colour. Looks beautiful. Nice head and good lacing is left over as it dissipates.

Smells of barnyard funk and that sort of sourdough yeast that you get on 3 Fonteinen lambics. Lots of fresh fruit character. Apricot, pear, some fresh apple, wet straw.

The oak barrel comes through nicely. Lots of funky fruit notes. Lemon zest, apricot, orange, intangible citrus notes, grape skin.

Medium body with a reeeally long and dry finish. The finish is great. 

This is a fantastic gueuze. Always worth the price and so consistent."

Still as good as I remembered."

I highly recommend buying this one if you can't get it at Ballast Brewery."
3283,Burrocreek,Sculpin,4.42,"This beer, and Bell’s Two Hearted Ale, are the best two widely distributed old school IPAs in America. This one leans bitter and the other leans sweet. Both are exceptional and difficult to surpass. Cheers!"
3284,eWell,Sculpin,4.57,"It’s my favorite among American IPAs. Has slightly sour taste but comes across as very fruity. Unfortunately, this beer (and the grapefruit version, which is perhaps the even more gifted sibling) is hardly ever available around where I live."
3285,soma5,Sculpin,5,This is a ridiculously good beer. Unfortunately we can't seem to get it any more here in Texas. Bottles are always better than cans.

Aromas of apples and light flowery, with medum strength.
Taste is juicy enough, but I'm getting a bit of harshness, like carbonation. I don't get the high ratings of this one?
Not very thick in the mouth. Feels like carbonation when you leave on your tongue.

Overall - i will not buy this one again. Just not that impressed."

3289,klarcbarr3,Ten FIDY,4.41,"A black body covered with a two-finger brown
head assimilates into a pint glass. The head is quite active, and fades in a few minutes, but leaves ample lacing... the carbonation level is good. The smell is absurdly light for a 10.5 ABV Imperial stout. Mostly malt and grain, with a subtle sweetness on the back end. The flavor, however is superb. Coffee and chocolate notes, malt, grains, nuttiness, subdued hops for the style... this beer is finely crafted, and literally wafts across the tongue like waves on the beach, especially as it warms during the session. The high ABV stout category has been somewhat overrun by a faddish movement toward barrel aged brews, and many of them are great beers... but Oscar Blues Ten Fidy is a great example of how good a finely designed Imperial Stout can be in the hands of a great brewer. I love this beer!"
3290,PorterBessette,Ten FIDY,1,Gave this beer a try on a whim and I must say that I was beyond disappointed in this brew. The whole thing tasted and smelled of rubbing alcohol flavored stout.

3291,cwm51662,Ten FIDY,4.32,"First sniff is chocolate, first taste is hops. I'm surprised I didn't rate this the first time I tried it. This is a solid, surprisingly not-sweet, ""What an IPA would like to be"" option."
3292,Whyteboar,Ten FIDY,4.59,"Poured black, really black. With a brown head that stood tall. 
The aroma, while not as strong as it would be for most as my nose has been affected by Covid, is still coffee and roasted malts.
The taste is an amazing balance of flavors; the roasted malts bring the coffee and cacao and dark fruits and the hops provide an edge that keeps the flavor in check. 
The feel is almost chewy, and it seems right for all the flavors that are present.
This is one of my favorite “pure” imperial stouts, just so good."

Taste: Sweet dark caramel and toasty malt. Alcohol, bitter cocoa and espresso before they slowly fade away to a lingering burnt coffee note.

Aroma: Strong and rich aromas of chocolate upfront. As a chocolate balls, it turns into a rich, dark chocolate aroma. Even a bit roast. Some coffee underneath with a mild bitterness. But Romans of chocolate come through. (4.25) 

Flavor: Strong flavors of chocolate upfront, a slight dark chocolate and coffee roast evolves in the middle before the bittersweet flavor of chocolate, caramel, toffee, maple syrup, develop off the end. Rich, sweet, dark flavors. The sweetness takes over any bitterness and coffee here. (4.00) 

Feel: Heavier-bodied, carbonation, dark, smooth, sweet and rich. (4.00) 

Overall: Big World-Class Stout here. My first try and review at it. Deep, rich, chocolate flavors. A bit off coffee roast, but the sweetness takes over here. Also complex malt flavors evolve off the end. It's definitely great. Sort of reminds me of an imperial version of Founder's Breakfast Stout. It's difficult for me to accurately guage these imperial stouts. In my biased, poor recollection I think I enjoyed Oskar Blue's Ten Fidy more. To me, this takes Founders' Breakfast Stout and makes it a big boy. (Rating: 4.09)"
3300,kflorence,Speedway Stout,4.54,"Picked up a single pint can with a canning date of 08/11/23.

Pours pitch black with a two finger thick, frothy brown head on top with great retention, slowly dissipating to a thin, but still quite creamy, layer of foam. Plenty of lacing on the glass as you drink. Carbonation is hard to see, except when you swish the beer around. Very pretty on the pour.

Aroma is a mix of dark roasted malts, cacao, coffee and spicy hop bitterness. Some nutty, earthy notes also present, as well as a hint of booziness. The aroma really opens up as the beer warms. Getting a lot more espresso, dark fruits and burnt sugars.

Taste follows the aroma well. This is strong stuff. A bit sweet up front, bittering as it sits on the tongue. Lots of dark, bitter espresso, dark chocolate, dark cherries, molasses in the malt base. The longer it sits on the tongue, the more the hop spiciness builds. Hard to identify the hop notes, but I'd say a bit of pine and earthiness. After the swallow, it mellows out a bit with a lingering bittersweet, roasted maltiness and some citrus pith. It's a little boozy, but not overly so for its ABV.

This one is full bodied with solid chewiness and spot on carbonation which gives it a velvety mouthfeel on the swallow. It's thick, but only a touch syrupy. It is somewhat of a palate wrecker, though. Fairly drinkable for its ABV.

This is a classic of the style. I first had this over a decade ago but am just now getting around to reviewing it. It certainly has aged well. I really have no complaints. It's a great sipper that allows you to explore the complexity of the beer on the palate, though a pint is plenty for me. I wouldn't hesitate to pick this up whenever I'm in the mood for a solid AIS. Cheers!"
3301,mvanaskie13,Speedway Stout,4.29,"Poured into goblet: color is solid black, head is tan and presents nearly two fingers thick, head lingers and then dissipates to solid top with some lacing on the glass sides. 

Smell is roast, cocoa/dark chocolate, dark fruit, coffee - darker roast, bitter chocolate, earth, some hop herbals. 

Taste is roast, dark chocolate, coffee/espresso, darker fruitiness, finishing with earth, herbal/tea, some booze. 

Mouthfeel is moderate carbonation, moderate sweetness, low bitterness but a lingering sweetness and slow drying booziness. 

Overall this brew is smooth at 12% - big flavors, moderate aroma, excellent mouthfeel for the style - drink slowly."
3302,Rug,Speedway Stout,4.29,"Canned 4/11/23

I cannot believe it’s taken me until now to try the OG Speedway Stout. It’s a damn legend and I’ve had a variant of it before but I’m very excited to try the base beer. Let’s crack open this stone cold classic and find out what it’s all about

Pours a very dark brown with 3 fingers of creamy dark tan head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing

The nose is definitely coffee forward and bitter, but it’s more gentle than I was expecting. I’m picking up on aromas of burnt coffee beans, dark toast, black cherry, dark chocolate, black tea, light earthy hops, and vanilla

It’s quite similar in taste though the coffee is a bit less impactful. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting dark roast coffee, dark toast, burnt caramel, dark chocolate, raisin, charred malt, light molasses, and black cherry. The swallow brings notes of dark roast coffee, burnt caramel, molasses, black cherry, black tea, earthy hops, vanilla, and dark toast

A medium body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a smooth beer. Finishes bone dry with a firm bitterness

This one is a classic for a reason. It’s not groundbreaking or anything but it’s very nicely done"
3303,Blogjackets,Speedway Stout,4.35,"Poured from a 16 ounce can, the body is very dark and opaque. Small initial head and light lacing. 

Aroma is mix of malty char, dark chocolate and coffee. Delightful.

Taste follows nose with an increased flavor of the coffee. Add a nice boozy flavor, not too hot. I'd prefer a bit more char, but this beer is delicious.

At first, a lighter mouthfeel than expected/hoped for but still solid. Once warmed, the mouthfeel was nicely creamy. Carbonation light."
3304,CruzinCooler,Speedway Stout,3.87,Awesome
3305,TurboMon_911,Speedway Stout,4.52,"(Canned on 3/10/23) Poured a dark chocolate color into a standard pint glass with a caramel 2 fingers high head that lingered and left an abundant amount of fine lacing behind. Earthy malt aroma is present with strong coffee and chicory presence up front. Anticipate from the smell that the flavor will be mainly coffee but it balances out with a nice malty backbone and a bittersweet chocolate finish. Full bodied, not for the light hearted, and @12% ABV this is a sipper. Another one well done, respect!"
3306,jkblr,Speedway Stout,3.92,"12oz bottled on Nov. 16 2021 (no thanks to the barely visible etching in the glass above the label that i can only see now that the bottle is room temp) poured into a Spiegelau stout glass at fridge temp 12% ABV. The beer pours dense black with light brown colored head. The head recedes to a thin cap and leaves a web of lacing. The aroma is mild with roasted malt and coffee. The taste is bittersweet roasted malt with weak coffee. Moderate bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with average carbonation and a mostly dry finish. Overall, ok, but not the world class beer I expected. Not likely to purchase another Alesmith product with the hidden date etching..."
3307,TheBricenator,Speedway Stout,4.5,"Look: Black as night and even my gentle pour initiates a billowing brown head that holds as a pillow and refuses to settle, eventually relenting and leaving sheets of lacing behind
Aroma: Espresso, roasted barley, baker’s cocoa, ethanol, blackstrap molasses, freshly baked bread, dark cherries, light earthiness, and piloncillo
Taste: Starts out with a ton of rich, dark chocolate that hinges on the edge of full-blown bitter cocoa and quickly joined by espresso, light cherry, and roast. These go back and forth with a nice bread/earthy profile in the middle with subtle caramel, molasses, and piloncillo hanging around, peeking in occasionally and closes with cocoa, coffee, and ethanol
Mouthfeel: Full, silky smooth, medium carbonation, and a smooth finish with a slight robust edge
Overall: This is outstanding stuff. I’ve only had this beer a few times in my craft beer experience and I forgot just how well-made and tasty it is, especially for such a big beer. Coffee, dark chocolate, roast, earthiness, malt sweetness, and alcohol come together in harmony to make this tasty libation and glad to have the chance to try it again. Recommended"
3308,Old_Guy,Wisconsin Belgian Red,4.41,"This was the first beer that showed me how complex beers can, truly, be. Our local grocery store for a village of approximately 600 has an excellent beer and liquor department.
They have a dedicated section of just New Glarus Brewing Company beers. They have all of New Glarus’ regular offerings plus their seasonal offerings too. I’m always looking for new beers to try and came across this. I have always liked anything with cherries in it. So I bought a 4-pack to try. Wow! What a great beer. To me it’s almost sour at first, but just let it sit in your mouth for a few seconds before swallowing and all kinds of flavor and magic happens.
At the time I bought this, unbeknownst to me, it was only a Summertime seasonal offering. To my disappointment when I went back later in the Fall it was all sold out for the year. So I had to wait until the following Summer before I could get and enjoy some more. It has since become one of New Glarus’ regular offerings. Yeah! I can enjoy it anytime now.
I’m retired now and I have told my friends that along with my numerous hobbies I’m also on a couple of quests in retirement. They are:
#1. Find the perfect Beer
#2. Find the perfect Bourbon/Whisky.
We are truly living in the golden age for this quest. With all the micro breweries and distilleries. I figure that I can sample a different beer, bourbon or whisky each day from now until I die and never run out of new things to try. Is this what they mean by “the golden years” when one retires?
I have not completed my quest but will keep trying and enjoy myself as I continue on.
This beer is right up there as one of my favorites. But I will not call it the perfect beer as that would put an end to my quest and I’m not ready for that yet.
Cheers! Everybody!"
3309,Rug,Wisconsin Belgian Red,4.3,"This is an ancient want of mine, as Imm pretty sure that for the longest time it’s stood as #1 in the very broad style of Fruot And Field Beer. I was never able to find this when I looked on MBC and then one day I just got lucky, because I found 5 New Glarus beers being sold together. All of the others have been pretty good to great, so I’m excited to dig into this legend

Pours a lightly cloudy reddish brown with 2 fingers of light beige head that quickly fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing

I’m not gonna lie, the nose has an odd medicinal quality dragging it down just a bit, though it’s still mostly good. I’m picking up on aromas of tart cherry, brown sugar, jammy raspberry, bready malt, vanilla, lemon zest, and light cough syrup

Things improve significantly in taste, both amping up the tartness and making it feel like a cherry pie. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting tart cherry, lemon juice, brown sugar, dark bread, vanilla, tart raspberry, and light honey. The swallow brings notes of tart cherry, graham cracker, pie crust, lemon zest, raspberry candy, brown sugar, light pecan, and vanilla

A light medium body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a sharp beer. Finishes a tad sticky but is ultimately very refreshing

The aroma had me a bit worried, but this one redeemed itself in taste. I truly wish I had consistent access to this"
3310,Mdog,Wisconsin Belgian Red,4.34,"Appearance: Dark red, good sized pink head.

Smell: Cherries, tartness.

Taste: Nice sweet cherry flavor with a bit of tartness, a little syrupy feel.

Overall: Picked up at the source in New Glarus, I'm not a fruit beer guy, but this was quite tasty. The cherry flavor was more on the sweet side than tart or sour, so that was a plus in my book. Might even have to get a 4 pack sometime!"
3311,Bouleboubier,Wisconsin Belgian Red,4.65,"(12 oz bottle, obtained at the brewery two days ago... poured into a clear, plastic cup)

Compared to the Raspberry Tart, I found much more clarity and brightness in this liquid; foam built on the pour, but didn't persist long... on the nose: cherry cordial, pie cherries; bold and in 3D... on the palate: pie-cherry Heering, but not syrupy sweet; a Flanders red character slowly creeps up in the aftertaste over each sip, never subtly malty, but the dominant flavor is otherwise pie cherries... the balance this maintains in drinkability is remarkable; clean and almost crisp despite suggesting syrupy residuals; its body sports a lithe, drawn out curvature... another spectacular acheivement on their part, mesmerizing and moreish; another I haven't had in 9 years - glad I have some left! (2187)"
3312,Wiskeytango,Wisconsin Belgian Red,4.79,Drink it and you can see it’s world class ranking. Perfect cherry brew exploding with taste
3313,OldManBrodie,Wisconsin Belgian Red,5,As perfect a beer as you could find. The Door County cherries are as delicious in alcoholic form as they are in pies or raw. The deep red color mirrors the incredible aroma and full flavor of this champion.
3314,BigFur_4S,Wisconsin Belgian Red,5,"I might be biased since a won a Beer vs Wine dinner with this beer on my dessert course. You can tell they somehow get 16 cherries into this bottle, and not in a bad way. Its a little fizzy on your lips during the entire experience from the carbonation. This is the most unique tasting ""Beer"" I've had the chance to drink. Its thickness is enjoyable since it doesn't stick to the inside of your mouth. Everyone should make the drive to Wisconsin to enjoy this beer."
3315,Eddie_Kobane,Wisconsin Belgian Red,3.5,"Good beer but too sweet, needs a higher ABV than 4% for the 4pk price. A little to cough medicine taste."
3316,JamesPatty,Wisconsin Belgian Red,4.84,The perfect mix of sweet and tart! It’s way better than Sam Adams Cherry Wheat
3317,drdiesel9483,Raspberry Eisbock,3.9,"Look - reddish brown with slight tan rimming.
Smell - raspberry grainy booze
Taste - about the same as the smell but not boozy when cold, boozy when warm
Feel - medium body slight syrup and carb
Overall - lots of raspberry and I wonder how much it covers up everything else"
3318,Bouleboubier,Raspberry Eisbock,4.19,"(375 ml bottle, 2022 vintage; purchased cold at the brewery last week... poured into tulip glasses)

Pours a touch cloudy; red-brown liquid, little foaming... raspberry juice dominant, with a touch of brown bread on the nose; mellow expression of perfumy brandy-like booze... on the palate: notably booze-forward, but not quite vinous-like; raspberry-dominant, but never even moderately sweet; the fruit and base beer seem to fight for contrast, a muddy affair that thankfully opens up and gains more depth over the course the journey through the glass... textures: lager-like clean finish, body attenuated in part by the hefty strength; warmer, the flow starts to develop a delicate roundness, but the palate is repeatedly stunned by hot flashes of ethanol... grateful for finally having tried this; while it does offer some interesting sensations, its taste leaves much to be desired; I would definitely try their other flavored eisbocks regardless (2191)"
3319,REVZEB,Raspberry Eisbock,3.66,"Brownish red murky body, cream colored head. Smell has that rustic boozy raspberry aroma leading, slight almost toasty yeast and sweet malt supporting. Taste is raspberry cough syrup with light booze backing, the aftertaste is reminiscent of homemade schnapps in the mountains. Feel is light and smooth but has that booze burn on the finish, which is typical for style honestly, big sugars add to this burn though. I have had better eisbock, the fruit here didn't add anything for me, if anything the sweetness knocked the balance of the beer further out of kilter"
3320,pathman,Raspberry Eisbock,4.25,06/04/23 bottle @ home
3321,Jwale73,Raspberry Eisbock,3.76,"2007 vintage. 6.3oz. Bottle / 13.8% abv. Pours a deep claret hue with no head. Nose expresses an abundance of raspberry (surprising, given the age), as well as a hint cocoa in the background. Taste consistent with nose; however, oxidation has definitely set in and there are some vinegar notes at the finish. Mouthfeel is light in body with a still carbonation. Overall, interesting and still complex, despite being past it’s prime."
3322,Sludgeman,Raspberry Eisbock,4.47,"Purchased this one at the brewery and muled it back home in my luggage. No ABV on the bottle. 12.7oz bottle, capped and waxed (red wine colored). Poured into a small-stemmed tulip.

I love this beer. The oxidation is what struck me at first, but the raspberry makes more of an impression as the session continues. 4.5

A – Pours a dark amber with a wine impression. Clear with a very small tannish head that disappears quickly leaving a ring around the glass. Average lacing and good viscosity on the glass. Looks like an old ale. 4.5

S – Raspberries, but not overwhelming. Some vinous qualities and oxidation like an old ale. No noticeable hops. 4.25

T – The ABV is slightly noticeable. Raspberry is faint and much less than perceived in the aroma. Very wine-like. No noticeable bitterness. Faintly sweet, which only adds to the taste and the drinkability. 4.5

MF – Medium bodied with a semi-dry finish. Some very minor astringency and even some citric acid at the end. 4.75"
3323,Rug,Raspberry Eisbock,4.42,"2016 vintage

Now this is a beer I’ve wanted for a long time. Kuhnhenn doesn’t distribute out in Mass, so I’m thrilled to finally get my hands on this, the highest rated Eisbock on BA. Eisbock is a style I’d love to find more of in general, but one this highly regarded is exciting. Let’s pop it open

Pours a muddy brown with a finger of off white head that quickly fades to a thin ring and leaves minimal lacing

Wow, the nose on this is incredibly expressive and spirit driven, it’s so complex. I’m picking up on aromas of tart jammy raspberry, cherry cordial, milk chocolate, sweet caramel, port wine, brown bread, raisin, nutty malt and sticky molasses

It loses its tart edge in taste, and maybe that’s a function of its age, but it is still complex and tasty. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting jammy raspberry, cocoa powder, brown sugar, sweet wine, fig, and brown bread. The swallow brings notes of cherry cordial, cocoa powder, port wine, sticky molasses, jammy raspberry, toffee, and earthy wood

A medium body pairs with very gentle carbonation, resulting in a boozy and slick beer. Finishes neutral with a little tingle, but drinks well below the listed 15.5%

While the taste was lacking a bit, this was still a fantastic beer! I definitely need to get my hands on a fresh bottle some day. It is very close to a liqueur or just a straight up raspberry filled chocolate, but the complexity sets it apart"
3324,Luscious_Malfoy,Raspberry Eisbock,4.43,"poured from a 375mL bottle into a snifter. pours a murky, dirty ruby red with a finger of sandy brown foam head. raspberries aplenty on the nose. a tinge of chocolate malt and even a faint whiff of alcohol burn. more raspberries on the taste with a lovely chocolate and malty background. not that there is anything wrong with the nose but the flavors are so much more complex than the aromas would lead you to believe. really smooth for such a high ABV. thick, full mouthfeel. very hard to tell this one is 15%. it’s a sipper for sure, and while it carrie’s qualities of old ales and doppelbocks alike, it drinks like an 8% fruited stout. really interesting style of beer. hope to try more of this style."
3325,jzeilinger,DRIPA (Double Rice IPA),4.18,"Canned on: 12-1-23
Many thx to The_Kriek_Freak for sharing this can.

A - Light medium gold with low carbonation.

S - Citrus and a distinct rice malt base.

T - Resiny from start to finish with a little bit of rice in the base. Ends with a lingering citrusy resin bitterness.

M - Medium body with light carbonation.

O - An interesting, flavorful take on a D-IPA with the use of rice."
3326,The_Kriek_Freak,DRIPA (Double Rice IPA),4.47,"A very unique type of a double India Pale ale. The rice contributes a surprising amount to both the nose and the flavor, but also the mouthfeel. Intensely hopped, both in terms of aromatics and bitterness. Lots of malty sweetness to balance things out. A great beer."
3327,Bouleboubier,DRIPA (Double Rice IPA),4.31,"(12 oz can, canned on 07/11/23; purchased cold single from brewery this week... poured into my Chouffe tulip)

L: amber-colored, mostly-clear liquid; ultra-tight, jiggly white foam... head settles into thin collar, lacing in long, thin drip bands

S: blackberry taffy, fruity pancake syrup, apple-berry fruit rollup, hint of lavender... one of the more unique IPA aromas I've ever sniffed... perfumy subtle alcohol highlights... altogether potent, if rather hazy/muddy in expression

T: much of the same on the palate; almost green oniony spice buzzing in the aftertaste... berries, currants, drenched in citrus peel oils... I can't help but suggest this has rather English strong ale hop/malt character/interplay; malt has perhaps a delicate honeyed bran muffin note to it

F: aside from its near bracing bitter sting, amplified by the ethanol and a soft carbonate sizzle, this drinks like a light-medium-bodied white wine... slight singing heat builds on the palate roof over time

O: a lot of their beers have a distinct flavor to them, and this is no exception... a uniquely flavored IPA that drinks like a (hop) resin-ravaged tripel (2190)"
3328,drdiesel9483,DRIPA (Double Rice IPA),4.06,"Look - bright copper and clear with a nice off white head
Smell and Taste - Classic citrus grain Imperial IPA
Feel - medium body with a lighter crisp carb
OVerall - fairly standard but still nice"
3329,BigIronH,DRIPA (Double Rice IPA),3.75,"Big citrus and pine resin notes. Taste follows suit with ripe orange and grapefruit fins hint bitter. Very soft mouthfeel. Overall, well above average."
3330,Sludgeman,DRIPA (Double Rice IPA),4.58,A rice ipa. Super clear golden. Looks like a budweiser but with a nice lacing. Smooth slightly sweet. Kuhnhenn call it west coast ipa but the high ABV and sweetness covers up much of the bitterness. Very good but not a classic west coast. Reminds me of a Founders Hopslam. Tender says they get that comparison often but that Kuhnhenn came out with the DRIPA five years before Founders figured it out!
3331,stevoj,DRIPA (Double Rice IPA),4.01,"12 oz can from Tavour. Hazy golden pour, fizzy head. Aroma is hoppy and lghtly fruity. Taste brings smooth malts with a huge hoppy bite. Light orange, minimally sweet. Bitterness stays on the palate. Sublime, smooth and strong."
3332,RoyalT,DRIPA (Double Rice IPA),4.17,"Appearance – This is a very hazy dull yellow with a nice off-white head that dissipated rather quickly.

Smell – The big lemon stands out in this unsweetened fruit nose. Lots of citrus and a bit of straw.

Taste – More lemon at the taste and a bit of malts that were hard to find at the nose. The hops are resiny with a hint of pine and very little sweetness.

Mouthfeel – This is medium-bodied and extremely dry. The dryness is massive at the finish, probably too much for the uninitiated.

Drinkability – Good thing the bitterness slows you down because at nearly 10% ABV it is a heavy hitter."
3333,jkh15,DRIPA (Double Rice IPA),4.71,"Fantastic. Nice hope flavor but crisp, clean, refreshing. Great beer."
3334,Mdog,Raspberry Tart,3.77,"Appearance: Dark ruby, good light pink head.

Smell: Raspberry and pretty strong tartness.

Taste: Tart and acidic with the raspberries in the background. Mix of tart and raspberries in the finish. Light bodied.

Overall: The other mainstay fruit beer from New Glarus, Raspberry Tart follows its name and provides a tart raspberry experience. I would have preferred more raspberry and less tart, but oh well. I prefer the Belgian red."
3335,Bouleboubier,Raspberry Tart,4.7,"(12 oz bottle, obtained at the brewery two days ago... poured into a clear, plastic cup)

Cloudy, raspberry red liquid; some lasting foam in the form of a collar... redolent raspberry on the nose... raspberry pie on the palate, fruit and dough; approaching fruit shrub in its acidity; mesmerizing dimension and expression of the raspberry flavor... the tart tingle invigorates my senses; its body has a lazy plushness to it, almost but not quite nectary... an aptly named beer; this was my first time having it in about 9 years, and I was in heaven; looking forward to sharing some with friends back home (2186)"
3336,The_Kriek_Freak,Raspberry Tart,4.49,The beer pours a dark red with a beige-like head that offers wonderful lacing. The aroma is of raspberry preserves and berry pie. Lovely flavor balance with both sweetness and tartness being present. Chewy mouth feel and long tart aftertaste. A really tasty sour.
3337,Tree_powers,Raspberry Tart,4.72,What do I say about one of the best beers of all time. It's a shame that it's only available in Wisconsin but probably a good one for my body since it would be stocked all the time if I could get it
3338,TommyG22,Raspberry Tart,4.44,I had stayed away from this beer thinking it would be really sour/tart. It is not. Just enough tartness so that it is not overly sweet. Will put this one on repeat buy list.
3339,cyclonece09,Raspberry Tart,4.28,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Pours deep red with an off white-red head. Smells of raspberries, very inviting. Tastes of creamy raspberry, nice and sweet, yet nice and tart. Beer is light bodied and easy drinking, good carbonation. Overall, a very good beer."
3340,dcotom,Raspberry Tart,4.7,"Poured from a 12-ounce bottle into a Zwanze 2018 logo stemmed goblet because it seemed like the right thing to do. The color approximates a murky and slightly watered-down cola, with a short snow-white head that left lots of spotty lacing. No question in my mind as to why this is among the top-rated beers of its style. It's fruit forward, with lovely aromas of raspberry jam balanced with notes of light breadiness. It's sweet, but not cloying. It's tart, but not overpowering. It has good carbonation and very low bitterness. It finishes perfectly dry. This made an ideal pairing with grilled chicken, and I could imagine that it would be absolutely stellar with crackers and aged Wisconsin cheddar. The only downside is that it's available only in Wisconsin, but who doesn't like a nice road trip once in a while?"
3341,Captain69,Raspberry Tart,3.56,very tart nice raspberry taste but i liked their cherry better
3342,hbeimers,Raspberry Tart,4.15,"This is very close to what I imagine a raspberry soft drink would taste like. It's very sweet, which in my opinion is the biggest downside, but otherwise is an amazing beer. Definitely more sweet than a typical fruit lambic or the belgian red."
3343,papposilenus,Marshal Zhukov's Imperial Stout,4.27,"From a… I don’t know what size bottle this is - maybe a 22oz bomber? It’s been awhile. At any rate, the volume’s not shown on the label. Bottled 09/25/19. Discovered tucked away somewhere-or-the-other while cleaning out Brewtopia. Served in a preternaturally fragile Spiegelau BA tulip-sort-of-gobletty thing.

Pours molasses-black with burnt caramel highlights and a scant finger of fizzy, muddy-brown head. Head retention is on the order of maybe 10 seconds before imploding, leaving pretty much the narrowest collar possible and a thin, oily film in lieu of any actual lacing.

Nose is rich, sweet and majorly boozy. Aromas of brown sugar caramel, black licorice and molasses. 

Taste is sort of roughly in line with the nose but less sweet than anticipated and more herbal and earthy. Tasting blackstrap molasses, leather and cedarwood. Soy sauce is notable but not unbearable. The long, slow, mellow finish is an unctuous melange of buttery toffee and aromatic woodiness.

Falls down a little on the mouthfeel. Slick, slippery and mouthcoating. A bit flabby feeling albeit with fine, prickly carbonation. An enormously belly-warming, boozy finish.

Just the ticket for a bitterly cold February night in New Hampshire when I’m not running the woodstove because I’m leaving the house for a few weeks to drive south for the rest of the winter… there, see now, when I type a run-on sentence like that, I know to check the bottle for the abv and, sure enough, there it is, it’s 11.2%. A little fore-taste of Tampa. In summation: doesn’t look like anything special which no surprise, smells fucking awesome, tastes pretty darn good barring a slightly tacky aftertaste not previously mentioned, and the mouthfeel leaves me feeling vaguely unsatisfied. So, a mixed bag."
3344,SaCkErZ9,Marshal Zhukov's Imperial Stout,4.39,"Dug deep into the cellar for this one. There is no date on the bottle but my guess is that I have had this for about 10 years, maybe more. It’s the yellow label version. 

Pours a motor oil thick black color. This thing is as dark as the night in Hades. No light penetrates this at all. It is topped with a one finger sized, lightly milked coffee color head and presents wonderful lacing down the side of the glass. 

Aroma is still quite special. Dark fruit and figs, coffee, tobacco, and soy sauce. 

Flavor profile is a slight let down. It is a little sweet. Flavors of astringent coffee, more tobacco, raisins. Even a little bit of smokiness to it, kind of like cigarette ash. 

I have never had this fresh but the 10+ year old version held up remarkably well. Probably not the best beer to drink in a 90F afternoon but it was still enjoyable."
3345,woemad,Marshal Zhukov's Imperial Stout,4.44,"EDIT: The flavor of this beer fooled me into thinking it was bourbon barrel aged. It's not. Nevertheless, I thought it was when I reviewed it. Bear that in mind.

22oz bomber received courtesy of Roguer. Bottled on November 6, 2018(!) Georgi's smiling face is gazing out from the label.

Poured into a stemless wine glass, this was a deep, dark brown, to all intents and purposes black. Big, creamy,mocha colored head initially, but it dropped away fairly quickly. Spotty lace.

Nose is is of bourbon, fudge, vanilla (probably from the bourbon barrels), brown sugar, and a maduro cigar.

Boozy up front, with the flavor from the bourbon barrel aging most prominent. There's also flavors of fudge, coffee, molasses, vanilla (undoubtedly from the bourbon barrel aging), and even a bit of something that reminds me of marshmallows. Really well balanced. Big, but approachable.

A little thin in the body for the style, but not to a deal-breaking point. Creamy mouth feel.

I was initially thinking it might be interesting to lie this down for a couple years to mellow, but it appears that has already happened, and then some. Makes me think that when fresh, this had a hell of a big barrel blast to it. The booziness, while noticeable, is not over the top, so it's not something that I'm finding unpleasant. Apart from the body seeming a little thin the only criticism I can make is that I'd rather have this in a 12 oz or 16 oz format, then a full bomber. But, hey, beggars can't be choosers, and I'm thrilled to scratch this one off my wants list."
3346,ryan1788a5,Marshal Zhukov's Imperial Stout,4.57,"22oz bottle poured into a small snifter. No date on the bottle that I saw, but I've owned it for 3-4 years and had bought it on the fresh side.

A: Oily black in color. An aggressive pour manages to kick up an inch and a quarter of dark brown head. It settles out into a very thin cap after a few minutes. Very fine-bubbled and thin lacing.

S: Chocolate fudge sauce and brownie batter, dark chocolate, bit of espresso, lots of woody roast with some soot and char. A good dose of earthy hops. Dark fruit esters manifest in the form of black cherry skins and blackberry. 

T: More or less follows the nose. There's a sweet brownie batter/fudge sauce impression up front, but that quickly gives way to roast. A lot of woody roast and espresso-type flavors take a firm hold. Great dark fruit flavors of black cherry skin, blackberry jam, and just a touch of black currant sauce. A very quick brush of stiff alcohol it nestled in amongst the dark fruit. Earthy and piney hops ride up on the back end and close out a drying finish alongside some trailing roast and smoke. 

M: Thick and rich in body. Almost but not quite coating, though there's a definite viscosity to the feel. Chewy. Amply carbonated with a fine-bubbled lift. There's a definite sense of heft, but it's fermented well enough that there aren't enough residual sugars left to tip it into sludgy territory. It strikes a good balance in that way.

O: Cigar City has nailed the Russian Imperial Stout style. This has a brawny, yet very classic feel. Style purists that eschew the pastry stouts and want a more no-frills, perfectly executed RIS will want to find a bottle to appreciate. It really doesn't get much better than this."
3347,Whyteboar,Marshal Zhukov's Imperial Stout,4.35,"Poured that lovely black into the snifter and provided a light brown head that took its time to dissipate.
Aroma was dark fruit, molasses, malts. No hint of bitterness.
The taste started where the nose left off and went from there. The malted base is definitely in command but the dark fruits steeped in sweet molasses were layered in quite nicely. There was just a touch of bitterness that seemed to punctuate the flavors and keep it all from actual sweetness.
The feel was smooth and viscous, I've had thinner BA stouts. Nicely done.
Worth seeking out, or at least picking up a bottle if you can find one."
3348,Roy_Hobbs,Marshal Zhukov's Imperial Stout,4.19,"Appearance is pretty spot on for the style. The deepest of browns / bordering black, and fully opaque. A fairly aggressive pour produced roughly half an inch of deep khaki colored head that receded to a thin ring. Aroma is fairly rich, with molasses and faint toffee complementing some base roast notes. Taste and feel are where this beer really starts to shine. There's a nice complexity to this. Bitter roast leads the way, but is well balanced by some sweeter flavors that I can't call out individually but that definitely add to the experience. Almost a little bit of cinnamon spice on the finish. Full bodied and smooth. Very tasty."
3349,CarolinaCardinals,Marshal Zhukov's Imperial Stout,4.5,"Picked up a 22 oz bomber from The Fresh Market in Hendersonville 12-10-21 for $21.99. No bottling date; consumed 3-18-22. Guessing this is a 2020 or 2021 edition.

Beer poured black as night with a nice brown head.

Nose is lovely, full of roasted malts, dark fruits, and floral hops.

Taste is really well done. Malt base is huge with a nice medium to heavy roast that emits notes of espresso, cherry, and some licorice. Finishes very well balanced with no suggestion of sweetness and a nice warming with each sip on a cool rainy day.

Mouthfeel is awesome as i look for in this style. Full bodied and near perfection with the viscous and smooth mouthfeel.

Overall a world class imperial stout that is right up there with the best non BA versions i have had! Worth the splurge, will look for this in cans next go around."
3350,sjrider,Marshal Zhukov's Imperial Stout,4.35,"On tap at the source - dark like used motor oil with quickly dissipating khaki head leaving a ring of tiny bubbles. Nose is bittersweet with chocolate ,coffee, roasty malt and molasses. Taste follows to a T. Slight alcohol creep lingers on the finish. Damn tasty!"
3351,Craig-er,Marshal Zhukov's Imperial Stout,4.39,"Purchased at Berts Better Beers in 2019. It did have an opportunity to rest for 3 yrs. The head quickly dissipated after a few moments. A heavy bodied stout. Smell consisted of bittersweet chocolate, taste was of cinnamon, espresso, that lingered on the palette for over 2 minutes. A spectacular RIS."
3352,trevormajor,Marshal Zhukov's Imperial Stout,4.7,"22 oz bottle, probably a 2021 vintage but not sure, poured into a pint glass at 55 degrees F:
L - black as night, with a soft hazelnut head that quickly disappeared into the Russian night....
S - molasses, chocolate, coffee
T - the blackstrap molasses dominates, but also notes of chocolate, coffee, and roasted malt
F - very thick with almost no carbonation, just the way a big stout should feel
O - excellent beer, picked this up in a bottle shop in Largo, FL. Makes me really want to try the other Cigar City Stouts that are so hard to find in the midwest"
3353,SHODriver,Kriek 100% Lambic,5,"Cork says 2013 on it

A: Poured into a tulip glass to a beautiful deep red which is topped by a dense and slightly rocky two fingers of pinkish head which fades slowly to a small mat with minimal lacing
S: Smells of funky oak with some sourness along with a touch of cherry
T: Taste is bright and acidic cherry up front followed by some funky oak, more acidity, a little furniture polish, hints of yeast, along with some more nice cherry flavor. On the finish there's more sourness, funky oak, hints of barnyard, cherry, and lingering hints of oak.
M: This beer has a body which is on the lighter side of medium. Carbonation is light but effervescent while the beer has a drying finish due to the acidity.
O: This is incredible. I definitely should have popped this one sooner, but it still drinks incredibly well. Great flavors and a really nice amount of complexity on top of aging beautifully."
3354,wedge,Kriek 100% Lambic,4.31,"Bottled: 27 June 2016

Slightly hazed garnet with a fat sticky pinkish head that retains nicely. Aromas of wet hay and wood, leather, mellow warm cherry spice. Damp wood, lemon, tobacco leaf, with most of the cherry flavor coming after swallow. Medium light and tart, but not overly puckering. Delicious!"
3355,beerwithmeIRL,Kriek 100% Lambic,4.78,"375ml Bottle - Pours ruby red with a 1.5 finger off-white foam head that dissipates rapidly. On the nose, notes of sour cherry are prominent, followed by weaker floral notes and oak. On tasting, cherry tartness comes to the fore with a gentle sourness that lingers. Earthy notes, oak and citrus are also evident in an outrageously complex and beautiful beer. Great mouthfeel with excellent carbonation and a dry finish."
3356,cambabeer,Kriek 100% Lambic,4.64,"Bottled: February 2016, drank August 2023.

Ruby red and brown cloudy body. Rose white head that leaves a thin cap of tight bubbles. Nose is cherries, hibiscus, rose, barn, wet earth, oak and funk. Taste is tart cherries, lemon, oak, earthy, wet cloth. Feel is smooth and effervescent champagne bubbles with soft and semi dry finish. 

Delicious, fruity, sour and earthy with some funk."

Bright brick red color with a light opaqueness and a good sized white head with a hint of pink in it. Solid earthy funk and lemony lactic tartness with huge cherry aroma flavor and tartness to round it out. This beer is beautiful I wish it were more available."
3360,Hat_Fulla_Beer,Kriek 100% Lambic,4.53,"750ml bottle poured into tulip. It's about goddamn time I found something from this brewery. Date on bottle says May of '22.

Pours lingerie red with half a finger of pink head that quickly sinks away without leaving lace.

Smells incredible. The second I pull the cork, the room fills with the smells of cold cherry pie, lemon juice, muddled stone fruit, rustic barnyard hay aromas, oaken barrel staves, wild blueberries, dried vanilla and cookie dough.

Tastes of intense lemon, black cherries, sliced peach and apricot, more vanilla oak notes, mixed berries, faint chocolate and more musty barnyard notes.

Feels soft and mild. Medium bodied with gentle carbonation. Finishes sour.

Verdict: Vigorously recommended. The work of masters."

A: Pours a clear, golden color with a short-lived with large bubbled white head disappears rapidly. No lacing at all.
S: Sharp. Aromas of apple, pear, vanilla, and Chardonnay grapes. 
T: Semidry and pleasantly tart. Flavors largely follows the nose. Very drinkable.

Look- pitch black with a thick dark mocha head. Very tight bubbles that slowly dissipate.

Smell - dark cocao and roasty malt

Taste- chocolate up front with coffee notes on the finish 

Feel - creamy with light carbonation. A little chewy

Overall- Not sure if this is one of those beers at just the right time moments, but this just hit me hard. Was really feeling it and was super impressed for this 8yr old stout. Almost no signs of oxidation. Drink em if ya got em!"

Bottled On Date: 11/20/2016
Consumed on: 20 Nov, 2022
Glass: Snifter
ABV: 10.5%
Serving Temp: 49.3 F


Look: 
Jet black with a brown head that is very thin. The head quickly dissipates to a ring with some film over parts of the beer. What lacing exists is excellent.

Smell: 
Dark, bittersweet chocolate and coffee. Char. Molasses. Anise. Caramelized and somewhat burnt sugar. A fair amount of earth.

Taste: 
An earthy and bitter hit up front, but nothing overwhelming. This becomes char, dark chocolate, and some coffee. Molasses and anise follow. The earthy notes return towards the end. The sip finishes bittersweet and this lingers into and through the aftertaste which is very much unsweetened chocolate.

Feel: 
Silky and mouth-coating. A nice warmth from the alcohol. The body is only a shade or 2 lighter than full.

Overall: 
An excellent (Russian) Imperial Stout. One of my favorites of the style. I buy it when I see it. Which last was in 2019.

I purchased this beer fresh back in December, 2016. It has been in my cellar ever since. It has handled its age (6 years) quite well I would say."
3368,RyanK252,Imperial Stout,4.33,"2015 Bottle poured into a Founders Brewing Co snifter

A: Pours basically black with a frothy cocoa brown head that settles to a light layer and leaves a little nice lacing. 

S: Roasty, earthy, a little char, dark chocolate, coffee, molasses, burnt sugar, slight umami notes, and faint hints of dark fruit. 

T: Roasted malt, dark chocolate, black coffee, a little char, earthy, molasses a touch of toffee, and faint dark fruit on the finish. 

M: Full body, mild carbonation, creamy smooth. 

O: Somehow I think this one went straight from the store to my cellar and has been there ever since, so it's about time I crack into it! 
Total time capsule back to before every imperial stout was loaded up with adjuncts and it's aged beautifully. Another example of why Founders is quite possibly the best at brewing dark beers."

S - roasted malt, molasses, bitter chocolate, coffee
T - follows the nose very well
F - thick mouthfeel with minimal carbonation
O - this beer lives up to the founders standard; it is supposed to age well and just under 2.5 years in it is still sensational"
3370,TooManyGlasses,Imperial Stout,4.43,"Single 12 ounce bottle from Founders in Grand Rapids Nov 2019 when travel was still a thing.
Pours pitch black with finger of creamy mildly reddish brown head.
Aroma of dark fruits, caramel, mildly roasty with notes of chocolate and just a hint of coffee.
Taste is rich with plummy note, chocolate; a brief wave of smoke drifts across the palate, caramel malt and a touch of espresso bitterness balancing the sweetness.
Rich and smooth full creamy mouthfeel with a hint of boozy heat - wonderfully bittersweet. Wish more had followed me home."
3371,crm871,Imperial Stout,4.23,"Look: Poured from 12 oz bottle into a snifter. Midnight black with a creamy burnt amber head. Wonderful looking beer.

Smell: Roasted coffee beans, malts, caramel, dark chocolate.

Taste: Chocolate, cacao, malts, coffee. Also getting some dried fruits - possibly cranberry or cherry.

Feel: Creamy thick mouthfeel, this thing just rips as it goes down. Has a dark feel to it (literally and figuratively), great for sipping with a book. Gets better as it warms.

Overall: One of the best Russian Imperial Stouts you can find pretty widely available, highly recommend. If dark evil beers are your thing, pick this up."
3372,chum_husk,Imperial Stout,4.24,"12oz bottle. This thing has been aged in the mini-fridge for 5+ years and now is the time to crack this sucker

It still has a decent amount of carbonation and a nice little ring of foam. It was meant to age, this is telling me. Smells like coffee, alcohol, chocolate, and hops. Prominent alcohol flavor, even at chilled temps and with the age on it. This was a bad boy back in the day, I bet. Tons of cocoa powder and a honey malt backing that compliments and stands up to the choco malt and alcohol flavors that come close to dominating"
3373,AdmiralOzone,Blind Pig,4.37,"Pours clear honey gold/amber with a thick white head that grudgingly falls away leaving generous lacing. Aroma is mild, earthy hops and some citrus. Flavor follows the nose, a touch sweet in front with a nice hoppy finish. Feel is light bodied and adequately carbonated. Overall, excellent."
3374,JacobusFavier23,Blind Pig,4.1,"L- Pours a golden colored bubbly beer with a nice solid frothy head that results in solid lacing around the edge of the glass.
S-Resin, pine, sweet malt, floral notes, peach, citrus–mainly grapefruit and some earth. 
T-The flavor is fresh and crisp. Solid notes of citrus and pine, a solid earthy backbone, malt, and a rewarding bitter bite towards the end. This beer does a really fine job of balancing sweetness and bitterness.
F-Really solid fizzy bite with a nice dry finish on the mouthfeel.
O-Just a really good West Coast IPA. Out of this one and Pliny, I'd probably side with the latter, but this is still very enjoyable. Glad I tried it."
3375,LifesAnesthesia,Blind Pig,4.58,"L - Pale yellow with a frothy white head that sticks around a bit, leaving behind a nice cap and a good amount of lacing
S - Fresh piney, floral hops, citrus, and malt 
T - follows the nose - tons of fresh piney, floral, butter hops up front and throughout intermixed well with cracker malt and citrus - good amount of grapefruit 
F - medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Refreshing 
O - a pretty solid all around IPA"
3376,TheWaySheGoes,Blind Pig,4.47,"Great lacing upon pouring. Lot of subtle flavors going on. Orange, grapefruit, pine needles, and breadiness from the malt comes through. I can see why some prefer this to Pliny. Almost like the Focal Banger to the Heady Topper. Balance between the sweetness and bitterness is fantastic."
3377,Act25,Blind Pig,4.43,"Cannot believe I havent enjoyed this classic before now. Bought WFM Mill Valley near the source bottled 30 days ago, in heavy glass. 
A) A finger FULL of white head with great retention and lasting lacing. Golden body, chill haze. 
S) SEE-saw of melon, woods, pine, lemon, peach, white pepper. 
T) Follows aroma, round peach and melon notes. perfect zesty bitter finale. 
F) Lots of mouth textures and sensations, punchy, bitter, cleansing. 
O) Deservedly classic in direction of OG IPAs and Dales Pale Ale but better."

3380,NickSMpls,Blind Pig,4.23,"Nose is woody and piney, rising from a light straw-color body. Light head, good lacing. Upfront bitterness which lingers well into the finish.

Mild resin aroma. Pine. Otherwise, it smells clean.

Grapefruit and pine flavor. It is mild. Slightly bitter finish with a little lingering bitterness.

Medium bodied with a pillowy mouthfeel

Solid west coast IPA."

Golden IPA body with a bit of chill haze. 
Aromas of peach, melon, some pine and lemon. Vibrant and clean. 
Flavors follow very closely to the aroma - lemon, peach...a little zestier with some citrus rind bitterness.
Bright entry, medium body and carbonation. Solid bitter punch mid-palate and to late in the dry finish. 
Outstanding."
3383,Shiredave,Iris,4.3,"A yearly treat I have missed a few times. The first few years I had it there were subtle changes in malt depth and hop presence though always a less sour beer than expected
Tall, dense clotted head forms quickly and slumps slowly.
Sour notes explode with the tiny bubbles along with wiffs of ripe apple and crushed berries. 
Malt sweetness balances the tart acidity while grassy, earthy hop spice adds depth and character.
Finish is long and mildly sour with lingering hop bitterness."
3384,5toutman75,Iris,4.4,I love the color of this beer. The carbonation is absolutely perfect and head remains after a vigorous pour. I get more funk on the nose than on the pallet. I wish it had more to taste. On the pallet it’s complex but I’ve had other beers with more. Overall a great beer and worth getting again if I can get it at a good price. I would love to age this and see how it changes.
3385,JohnnyHopps,Iris,4.33,"Appearance - The beer poured a hazy shade of amber his a huge bubbly white head. This beer could not wait to get out of the bottle!

Smell - The nose was like a rustic dry sour presence with a definite green apple presence. 

Taste - The profile was pleasantly Earthy. It initially had a floral quality that brought to mind herbal tea. Also included were notes of oak, lime, and green apples. The sour notes were steady, not screaming for attention or melting dental fixtures. The beer had a nice dry finish. 

Mouthfeel - After the head finished rising, the carbonation was only moderately intense. 

Overall - This was a solid lambic, though not necessarily one I would seek again."
3386,Holderness,Iris,4.33,"2021 bottling. Medium amber in the glass with some haziness and a finger of dense off-white head that retains fairly well and leaves minimal lacing. The maltiness here is quite unique indeed, almost like a Flanders Red -- getting some toastiness and cherry pie notes in the aromas and flavors. Moderately acetic with a fluffy and lively effervescence. The hops impart a lightly bitter herbal flavor, but it's not too overwhelming and compliments the oaky barrel character. Happy new year!

3387,zac16125,Iris,4.32,"750mL bottle into a Teku
Bottled: 25 Feb 2019

Pours translucent with the slightest degree of haze. Golden copper in color with 2 fingers width of off white colored head. Aroma is very floral, grassy fields, some nondescript fruity esters and pungent cheese like funk. Tart citrus acidity rounds out the aromas. Very complex nose. Taste is somewhat tart upfront but not nearly to the degree of most Cantillons I’ve had and it’s also notably more funky with barnyard and pungeant cheese like funk. Prominent bitterness on the finish. There is a fairly prominent sweetness to balance. Mouthfeel is vibrant with high carbonation and excellent drinkability. Overal, far from my favorite Cantillon but a complex and exceptionally well done beer.

The flavour is sour but not extreme, hints of oxidised apples and spices, unlike other lambics it also has a distinct hoppy bite in the finish."
3389,FBarber,Arctic Devil Barley Wine,4.48,Thinner barleywine both in appearance and in mouthfeel. Hops are noticeable on the nose. Lots of barrel in the profile with a lovely bourbon barrel aged maple syrup character. Great under the radar barrel aged barleywine.

pale, bitter, palate numbing...

what I can add from memory: somewhat tart and biting, but lines were blurred with its sedate, subtly herbal, delayed bitter hum... took my time sipping this one, trying to delineate where the funk ended and hop infusion began... cloudy in appearance and expression... I'd of course be curious to try this from a bottle decant... decent opener for the event (2037)"
3393,BubbleBobble,Cuvée Saint-Gilloise,4.03,"Pours a hazy gold, 1"" white head, mild lacing. Nose is hairspray, lemon, hay, and lots of barny, wet funk. Taste follows forward with sweet, mildly tart white wine, lemon, but little expression of the funkier elements on the nose. As it warms, the sweetness and tartness of the wine continue to open, but little in the way of earthy, funkier elements. Feel is smooth with moderate carbonation, but it drinks cleanly and invitingly. Overall, however, lacking in some complexity on the palate."
3394,HattedClassic,Cuvée Saint-Gilloise,4.46,"2019 Vintage; Stored under okay conditions (Stable environment, very little light)
The beer pours a nice off-white head that forms at a moderate pace: not too fast but gradual. The beer itself is a clear metallic amber color that looks very good.

The smell is absolutely wonderful. It starts off with light strawberry notes while cold and warms up to let through a variety of citrus fruit notes such as grapefruit, orange, a light lemon, and hints of lime that pop in and out. The funk note is moderate with hay notes to it.

The taste is very good. It has a strong citrus fruit note upfront that consists of grapefruit and a stronger lime note than in the smell. The funk shows up mostly as a musty hay not with a acidic tartness to it.

The feel is good. It has a light to medium body and moderate carbonation. It has moderate acidity.

Overall, a delicious cuvee worth getting and holding for a few years in ideal conditions ( away from light and stable temps)."
3395,BigMac59,Backwoods Bastard,4.28,"Pours very dark copper to dark brown, almost black. 
Beautiful dense head which dissipates to a thin remnant with normal lacing. 
Smells of scotch, bourbon, caramel and malts. 
The bourbon taste comes through with notes of fruit (someone mentioned apricots) and some sweetness (caramel, chocolate, malt). 
Lovely mouthfeel, just right for a rich scotch ale. 
Overall, World Class."
3396,Dathon,Backwoods Bastard,5,"Incredibly smooth. This beer hits on just about everything. The initial flavor is caramel with a lingering flavor of oak, malt, and the added note of some sort of dark fruit not sure which but it comes and stays on the finish. I am a big fan of blackrocks barbaric yawp but I don't know if any beer in this category can compare to the backwoods bastard. Everytime I try this beer I am blown away. incredible."
3397,Jay430,Backwoods Bastard,4.9,"I’m no beer judge or can describe every little nuance in a beer. But I love to drink all different kinds of beer. And I absolutely love this beer. Scottish and Irish are my go to’s I must admit. With that being said I have tried and also home brewed a lot. 
Looks yummy in the glass and the smell will make your mouth water. Taste is everything you like about Scottish Ales without anything being an assault on your taste buds. The bourbon flavor and aroma are immediate but pretty subtle and don’t take over in anyway. Even at 11% it’s almost impossible to sip this beer. 
It leaves you with a bourbony chocolate taste in your mouth and in your nose. 
If you even think you like Scottish beer and have a chance to try this, I highly recommend it."
3398,Lanoke12,Backwoods Bastard,4.93,Great strong scotch ale. The bourbon adds to the complexity and deepens the malt flavors. Definitely a great sipper on a crisp night. Perfect for the fall or a late night any time of year.
3399,EVH5150,Backwoods Bastard,4.74,"This is one of my favorite beers on planet earth. It has it all and I buy it any chance I get. It really does sip similar to a single malt scotch which is great because I had to swear off my whisky fetish awhile back. Beer makes me behave MUCH better. I get the typical notes of vanilla, caramel, and toffee from the bourbon barrels and it has a bit more sweetness than similar beers which I personally love. Not too much but just right. Lastly, the mouthfeel on this beer is top notch. I cannot recommend a beer more than this one."

But here in 2023 this reminds me of all those years ago.. such a fantastic bba stout from such an underrated brewery. I know everyone here gives them their props, but I think we get consumed in the new when these original craft breweries slip through sometimes. Barrel Aged Blackout Stout is delicious and full of flavor. Traditional imperial stout to from the color to the nose and down to the last drop. It’s dark and bold with some real booziness in its warm state(yes I consume most stouts and darker ales at room temp.. even the Trappists for that matter) but this is an American imperial stout done right. It’s flavorful and packs a punch. World class imperial stout from a world class brewery. Never mind the price.. just buy a can(yea in 2023 it’s delivered in a can) I still have the bottle from all those years ago, but the can.. beautiful in all it’s dark artwork. What a treat this is"

3407,Oktoberfest,Blackout Stout - Barrel-Aged,5,"ABV is 12.5% per the can. I submitted an update here.

Black/brown appearance. 

A violent pour yielded a HUGE, noisy tan head; a thick curtain of tree-rung lacing remained. 

Burnt caramel, wood, dark chocolate & fresh earth notes in the nose. 

Creamy medium thick mouthfeel. 

Wood, cream, dark chocolate & faint hop bite; booze heat emerged as this warmed. 

Creamy & easy to drink, but with nice Russian Imperial Stout vibes around the edges. Enjoyable."
3410,Lucular,Blackout Stout - Barrel-Aged,4.23,"10 oz draft pour at Frisco Taphouse in Gambrills, MD. Appearance is an opaque near-black with a smallish tan head. Aroma and flavor feature dark roasted malts, semisweet chocolate, dark fruit (date, mainly), bourbon, and vanilla. Mouthfeel is on the thinner side but not harsh or overly boozy. Overall an interesting beer to compare to BCBS or Black Tuesday - much less sweet, more dark fruit flavor, and a thinner mouthfeel."

I'd just met a couple of other beer tourists (they were American, but that's ok!), had spent too long at Hofbräuhaus Traunstein, and needed to return to the van before our parking was up. I sent the old man on alone when I saw this and told him I'd be as quick as possible! Notes are, therefore, perfunctory, and I'm a little bummed that I didn't get time to sit with this beer and give it the attention it deserved. I suspect it would have rated higher had I given it time to really warm and settle into its stride.

L: Dark ruby brown with a quickly dispersing coffee-coloured head. No carbonation seen. Looking hard, the beer is transparent, but only if you look for it. 

S: Dark glacé cherries; Christmas cake; Dr Pepper; dark, rum-like spirits. All aromas deepen as the beer warms. 

T: Utterly delicious! Rich dark fruits, Christmas cake, molasses, dark cherries, rum. 

M: Surprisingly sharp on the tongue, especially with the reasonably mild carbonation and easy swallow. Some warmth in the chest, mouth and throat after the swallow. 

O: I was in a rush when I drank this, to my regret. It's an exceptionally good beer that needs to be sat on, not drunk in a hurry, because you have to be somewhere else! 

Cheers!

3414,Ernald_Elbertson,Celebrator,4.55,"One of the best Doppelbocks you can get. Rich, dark, lager with similarities to other dark, high abv old-world beers (think Robust British porters, Foreign Export Stouts, and Wee Heavies). Very well balanced unlike a lot of American versions, which approach 10% and more resemble barlywines. Full of rich malty flavors, a low-moderate roasty character, moderate dark fruit sweetness, moderate boozy flavor, toffee, and small chocolate and coffee notes. Hops help to provide moderate bitterness and floral notes. Nothing is overwhelming, but all are decidedly present. Carbonation is substantial; not quite the level of belgian ales, but far more than british styles. Think moody taverns, bonfires in autumn with company, and thanksgiving gatherings. Pairs well with soft cheeses and fruity desserts."
3415,kryan747,Celebrator,4.27,"Really great beer, strong smell of caramel maltiness , almost a deep dark fruity quality to the nose; taste was of briefly coffee then a nice lasting malt finish, very drinkable, very enjoyable"

3417,ScruffySouthpaw,Older Viscosity,4.36,"Served in a snifter glass from the bottle. 

Appearance: Dark black color with medium bubbles to the body. Tan head off the body which rose maybe one finger's length. Dropped to almost nada after two or three sips. No lacing at all due to the slightly thin body. 

Smell: Heavy brown sugar, smells warm...as if it was melted in a saucepan with the coffee brewing next to it. 

Taste: complex and sweet...molasses overdose which hits your with a touch of espresso and whiskey to go with. 

Mouth: sticky brew, medium carbonation. Sweet finish which lingers in the mouth cheeks for a very very long time. 

Overall: Whiskey heavy which you get no complaints from me. Soft carbonation with the most everlasting stickiness to the brew. Salud!"

Very sweet (too sweet?) and intense flavour, sweet malts galore, notes of bourbon, oak and vanilla again, also notes of mild coffee, dark chocolate and liquorice. Moderate hops."
3419,hopley,Older Viscosity,4.69,"2010 bottle, drank 2020. Definitely waited too long, and this bottle definitely wasn't kept in optimal conditions over the years, but based on my ratings, I really enjoyed this...!!

Smelled wonderfully bourbonny and stouty. Wasn't flat but had lost an element of carbonation. Taste was nicely bourbon stout, not char or roast but a enough in that direction to let you know it was a traditional stout. Can't believe this bad boy has fallen so far in ratings over the years in the face of pastry stouts. I'm going to see if I can find a more recent bottle just to have one on hand as this is too good to not revisit now and then. Cheers!"
3420,DvdP,Older Viscosity,4.54,"Stamped Vintage 2014-A. Pours black, minimal head, not as viscous as you'd think. Bourbon smell, chocolate. Mouthfeel isn't very thick, but crazy smooth. Taste is amazing. Lots of soft bourbon, plenty of chocolate, old leather, hint of moccha. Crazy soft."
3421,Oh_Dark_Star,Older Viscosity,4.31,"L: Pitch with a toffee ring of a head.

S: Roasts of all kinds: roasted raw sugars, vanilla beans, coffee, and a touch of pure char. This is mostly roast and bourbony-vanilla notes.

T: Like an oaky oatmeal stout that has seen it's day in a barrel. Vanilla for days - coffee roastiness and some minimal chocolate.

F: Smooth and coating medium-heavy feel. Not a stand-out in its viscosity in my view.

O: Clearly this beer holds up for a long time based on the 8 year vintage below. Mine was a 2014 vintage tried in 2019 and a five years I imagined it had lost something. My friend, an older viscosity expert, agreed it had. We presume on that collective experience that three years is likely ideal aging. But this was solid nonetheless."

A - Pitch black pour with micro-thin toffee colored lacing and no carbonation at all. Appearance is flat but lots of legs on the sides of the glass.

S - Dark chocolate, some delicate black licorice, oak, slightly boozy on the nose, some dark sugar and molasses.

T - Light coffee, dark chocolate, oak tannin, bourbon, delicate traces of dark fruit and molasses on the very back end. 

M - Silky, viscous, and sticky on the lips with some slight warming in the back of the throat.

O - This held up incredibly well for being a 2011 vintage. Impressed."
3425,RonaldTheriot,HefeWeizen,4.52,"Live Oak Hefeweizen has a medium, white head and a hazy, yellow-gray appearance, following the ""swish & pour"", with no lacing.

Live Oak Hefeweizen has a light-to-medium body and a dry finish.

3426,LonghornStonefly,HefeWeizen,4.89,"First had it on tap in a local Texas bar many, many years ago (Gingerman - circa 2003 perhaps (?)), and then the heavens opened up and lo and behold it was available IN CANS locally (I wept). Then, about a year or so ago it was no longer available at my local outlets at all (wept again, profusely) but wife and I paid a visit to the brewery while in Austin recently and could both drink and buy stock there (you guessed it...wept like 8 pound 6 ounce baby J*sus). At least I know where to get it now - and this gives me yet another reason to get to Austin as much as possible. Unquestionably the best heffe I've ever had (with Schneiderweisse's Tap4 being the red headed, weird ""different"" cousin at #2)."
3427,ThisWangsChung,HefeWeizen,3.36,"Pours a murky straw color. I'm disappointed in the head, particularly in its poor retention and hesitation to grow. The aroma is far superior, showing off clove, banana, and bubblegum in equal measure. Some nice wheat notes pop up after warming up a tad. Flavor-wise, it follows the nose, albeit not as intensely. The banana, clove, and bubblegum are all there, albeit muted. I also get some wheat flavor on the finish. Everything is properly balanced and where it should be, it's just that everything is at 60% intensity. The mouthfeel is oddly sharp, and honestly a bit watery. The carbonation is there, but the softness isn't...not at all. Did the DMV get a lesser batch or something? This is definitely not the #2 hefeweizen to me, and it certainly doesn't measure up to the best German examples. It's fine, though - I'd take it over quite a few American-made hefeweizens."
3428,cjgiant,HefeWeizen,3.56,"On tap:
Note: had can from same distribution as keg, and it didn't perform any better, in fact slightly worse. There are obvious differences in what others are perceiving, so maybe we just got a subpar batch in the DC area??

The beer allowed the bartender to fill liquid to the top of the glass. Even drinking it down a tad and swirling things around barely revived the razor thin ring of bubbles. The body was a fairly cloudy, pale bruised banana.

The nose is of moderate strength, but has a banana bubblegum quality that is nice. A little bit of the banana comes through in the taste, but there’s also a lemon-spritzed grain flavor that is more prominent, as I started sipping.

Allowing the beer to warm a bit (along with noshing a little food) opened up some more familiar Hefe notes. The banana and bubblegum upped their game a bit to replace the tangy lemon-like note I was getting, edging the beer towards the sweeter side of balanced.

Overall, this still wasn’t wowing me, and I think the somewhat watery feel I was perceiving hurt it the most. I’d be willing to give this highly rated beer another try, at least, to see if maybe I was just a bit off today."
3429,Gansito_Slim,HefeWeizen,4.65,"When I first drank this - bought from an Exxon station of all places - I didn't know anything about beer. But I knew immediately this was something special, and it became my choice when I wanted to upgrade from a 40oz malt liquor. In the years since, I have learned to name the component flavors, and the processes that yield them in the brew, which I'm sure you can research. But that all seems beside the point.

What is the point then? Simply: This is a smooth, tasty, complex beer. Very little compares in the US, and it's better than Paulaner. You can enjoy it slowly. You can smash it. Equally interesting to the scholar and the party animal. A ""desert island"" beer that would also work in the frozen tundra. The last beer you might ever need. The omni-brew."
3430,snaotheus,HefeWeizen,3.7,"2023-06-10
12oz can served in something similar to a wineglass with no stem. Can is dated 02.14.23. Got it from @MrSandman101 in a trade.

Pours moderately hazy, with a fairly small, foamy, short-lived head, which settles to nothing at all. There's a little bit of active carbonation that I can see. Smell is spot-on, yeasty banana notes, a little spiciness that makes me think of cloves.

Taste is also spot-on, reinforcing what I got from the nose. There's also a nice grainy characteristic.

Mouthfeel is leaning toward thin, feels pretty still. Overall...tastes good, smells good, needs some head retention -- it looks indecently naked!"
3431,kflorence,HefeWeizen,4.37,"Date on can: 04/19/2023

Pours a cloudy, golden orange in color with a finger thick foamy head that dissipates to a thin layer with time. Carbonation looks quite lively. There's a fair amount of lacing as you drink, although most of it slides down the glass. Pretty standard look for a hefeweizen, although I think the head could be a bit creamier and longer lasting. Nit-picking, though.

Lots of banana, clove and bubble-gum on the nose. Bread and butter with a hint of spice. Not unlike banana bread. A classic hefeweizen aroma.

Taste follows the nose pretty much identically. Banana, wheat/bread, clove, bubble-gum. Simple, yet refined, and very clean.

This is medium bodied with delicately zesty carbonation and a tiny bit of chewiness. I actually expected this to be over-carbonated, happy to report that it is not. However, I also expected this to be chewier, it feels a bit thin overall, though that does lend to its drinkability.

This is a finely crafted Bavarian style hefeweizen. If you gave it to me blind, I would probably guess that it was from Bavaria, which is truly high praise. I doubt I could find a better brew of this style in the U.S. It won't be my highest rated for the style, but it's certainly up there. I must admit that I am not a huge hefeweizen fan, though I do crave them occasionally. This one drinks extremely smooth and clean. It is simple, but what's there is high quality. I've actually had this one several times but for some reason never got around to rating it. I did not realize it had such a high rating here, but it seems entirely justified. Live Oak continues to impress, I have not had anything from them that has been less than superior. Cheers!"

Look: Classic hefeweizen look (mildly opaque straw yellow) with 0.5 fingers of white head
Smell: Wheat and bananas
Taste: Follows the nose. Plenty of wheat, bread, and banana notes. 
Feel: Medium bodied with good carbonation
Overall: There is no doubt why this beer is considered world class by Beer Advocate. Delicious and on par with the best hefeweizen beers from Germany. I was so impressed with the taste of this beer that I returned to the same bar the following night and ordered another."
3433,Bluerabbitbell,HefeWeizen,4.23,"3/28/23 On tap at Live Oak Brewing, Austin TX

Enjoyed this one very much."
3434,ZAP,HefeWeizen,4.67,"Elite Hefeweizen that hits all the notes. Banana, bubble gum, touch of cloves on the aroma and taste... lighter bodied, easy drinking. Maybe borders on a little thin if I'm nitpicking..Probably the best U-S made Hefeweizen I've had and better than some Germans like Paulaner."
3435,AzfromOz,Apricot Ale,2.96,"Purchased at Plonk in Fyshwick in August 2023 and drunk in January 2024.

L: Clear golden amber in the glass with no head whatsoever. Large bubbles in a few separate columns work their way rapidly up the glass. 

S: Sour mash, oak, and overripe, fermenting fruit lying on the orchard floor. 

T: Sour, lactic tarntess. Some hint of wood and oak but no hint of apricot on the swallow. On consideration, it does come retronasally, but often not until the second breath. That said, I'm searching for it and only just getting it. Otherwise, the beer is very tart; too much so, in my opinion. 

M: The mouthfeel is quite soft, but it definitely bites on the swallow and then on the way down. 

O: I think this one is a miss. I'm not a fan of sours, but I try to be unbiased in my reviews, and even with my unbiased pants on this is still too sour and lacks any real presence of the supposed headline act of the beer.

3440,maximum12,Apricot Ale,3.58,"Cascade is one of the few U.S. sour brewers that I regularly enjoy. I have no idea why. 750ML C&C bottle/2015 project split with my wife. 

I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention I picked up this bottle at HyVee for $5 on clearance. Because why not? The pour is unalloyed gold with plenty of life with a nose of what? Tart apricots. That’s just a guess. 

Apricot Ale is a sharp, simple beast. Nitric acid puckers the palate & the barrels team up to cause arid mouth syndrome. Apricot is subtle but runs throughout. Light & airy. This glass is going to do me just fine, but it’s the rare sour I can consume more than one of. 

Not Cascade’s best work, but perhaps the apricot is just not enough to stand up to the microbes. Still a good solid brew."

The smell is pretty damn amazing. I get funk, dank basement, and an acidic Flanders ale smell. There is tart apricot. This is what I want sours to smell like.

Tart and acidic. The apricot helps cut the acidity but only so much. It has that wonderful dank basement and funk flavor. The sourness is puckering, and I love it.

Taste: Sour, very sour, tart, apricot, hay, dust, wood, oak, lemon zest.

Mouthfeel: Moderately sharp, medium bodied, with moderate carbonation.

Nose is quite nice, not much for fruit but plenty of sour funk, big bacteria souring and acidity, acetic and lactic acids, little barnyard funk, getting a touch vinegary, with some buttery oak still there, and a bit of candied stone fruit in the background, some malty aromas as well

Taste brings more of the malt and sourness, a bit of a sweet candy malt and caramelized sugars, with some candied apricot, not a ton, a bit of alcohol but not much, souring bacteria again with mild acetic acid, maybe lactic but hard to tell, light barnyard funk, a little malt vinegar, into some buttery oak as well, mild tart flemmy finish, lingering sourness, malt and candied fruit

Mouth is med bod, a little fuller touch syrupy, med acidity and funk, low to almost no carb, light alcohol warmth

As bold as the beer looks, the nose is surprisingly muted, but I do detect coffee, chocolate, and malt in equal measure, which is reassuring. The taste is bounces right back to the boldness of the look, and is complex. Coffee, chocolate and malt notes are there, but hops push right in. This is one of the hoppiest imperial Russian stouts I have ever had, and I find that amazingly appealing. As you swallow, a fully rounded sweet aftertaste arises... bold, like molasses. This brews' balancing act of coffee, chocolate, malt, hops, and molasses is artfully composed, and unique. Each flavor stands out, and taken as a whole, this is a fascinating brew. I have been wondering for a decade why everyone speaks lovingly of Stone Imperial Russian Stout, and now that I have tried it, I believe the rave reviews I have read are all fully justified. What can I say? I WILL be stocking up!"
3459,cjgiant,Imperial Russian Stout,4.31,"A jet black pour produces a deep tan, creamy head. Lacing is streams and spots with varying stickiness. Feel is pretty aggressively bitter, fitting in with Stone's reputation but it has the effect of roughing up the nearly full body of the beer for me. Aromas open with chocolate and coffee emphasized in the dark malts, with the piney hops starting to play in as the beer warms up. Bitterness is up front in the taste, seeming at first coming from the hops, but the roasted notes of coffee, hiagh-cacao dark choclate, and even a little campfire ember combine and take over by mid-taste. Carbonation level is nice, keeping the dark malt richness from weighing down each sip too much."

Compared to North Coast Old Rasputin 3/2023: Pours similar, darker head. Stronger aromas. More Dark chocolate, and bitter pine. Less bittersweet chocolate, English black malt and cream. Darker, heavier, and more bitter pine. 

Overall: A very-well made Russian Imperial Stout. Dark chocolate, coffee roast, yeasty, yet incredibly dry and drinkable. The drinkability and dryness is the key here and how it hides the alcohol. Only this one and Old Raspy are the two that I've had that can do this. This may be a close second to Old Raspy. (Rating: 4.12)"

Paid a premium price, but have been wanting to try this one!

Oh, sweet Belgian goodness from a hazy golden coppery beauty! Cinnamon, sour, apple cider, and of course the banana!

Smooth with a carbonation bite and sweet enough to be excellent, but not cloying. 

Most excellent special treat!"
3468,DFred,Trappistes Rochefort 8,4.5,Wow--been working my way through Belgian Ales--only drinking 90+ here on Beer Advocate--this one was exceptional--really enjoyed it--excellent Trappist Ale!
3469,Cathartes,Trappistes Rochefort 8,4.17,"11.2 oz acclimated to 58°F and poured into a goblet.

Pours a murky cedar brown with lighter flecks of sediment drifing around. Has a 1 finger foamy white head, dissipating quickly and leaving a nice film of lacing.

Initial aroma is rum extract and general dried fruit (primarily prune). Maybe chestnut or something else that's nutty? Also present is a sweet dairy smell, combining with the rum extract smell I can't help but think it eggnog or custard. A general Christmas spice can be found, as well as a hint of vanilla. This is a lovely and inviting smell that immediately brings to British/Christmas desserts, wonderful. Agitating conjures a creamy dairy aroma, followed by that rum smell.

Initial taste before swallowing is peppery, vaguely fruity, and slightly sweet, building into some alcohol burn. After swallowing a mellow maltiness comes forward, accompanied by a rum extract note and nutmeg notes, quickly a sweetness builds, joined afterwards by a moderate alcohol burn. I pick up a note of bourbon vanilla further in in the exhale and aftertaste, as well as brandy or whiskey or similar later. The aftertaste remains mostly sweet and dried fruit flavored. Throughout the whole experience I couldn't shake the feeling I was drinking eggnog, which personally I am largely in favor of.

Feel is creamy, almost like drinking thin milk. I find that it flows effortlessly. The carbonation doesn't last, unfortunately, but otherwise the mouthfeel is very nice.

Overall, superb. The only gripe I have is that I found it a tiny bit lacking in flavor. Odd, considering the alcohol content, and I think the flavors present are magnificent, but I yearn for just a smidge more. Otherwise there's nothing negative to say. The whole experience was very enjoyable and I look forward to trying it again.

Will certainly buy again for special occasions, just need to determine which of the 4 by the brewery is my favorite. Will absolutely recommend the 4 as well."

500mL can (code L22091 14:06 / 010422, so maybe packaged 4/1/2022) into a weizen glass. Pours a nutty brown color, somewhere between iced tea and cola, with a soft off-white head and steady carbonation. 

Aroma is fruity and bready, not unlike a marzen. Clove and spice, ripe banana, a hint of root beer. 

Taste follows nose. Sweet bready malt, yeasty esters, fruit and spice. 

Mouthfeel is clean and crisp, light to medium body. Lively carbonation keeps this beer dancing on my palate. Super drinkable. 

Overall a solid, well-executed traditional beer that defines the style.

4.45/5  rDev +2.8%
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5
500mL bottle (code10.207 2 / 0393 2823) poured into a weizen glass. Pours a beautiful hazy copper-brown color with a ridiculous off-white head and cascading carbonation. Head condenses to a thick rocky pillow of foam that recedes slowly. Big pockets of air develop within the massive head around the sides of the glass; frothy lacing forms in its wake. There's a bright amber glow where the light reflects up from the bottom of the glass, then the beer gets darker as you reach the top. Just a gorgeous beer to behold.

Aroma is overripe bananas, sweet malt, clove and other spices. Nice fruity, floral aroma with a hint of yeast.

Taste is a mouthful of spotty brown bananas, sweet bready malt, raisins, yeast, and spice. This is the definition of mellow. Nice clean mouthfeel that leaves a pleasant sweet aftertaste. The high ABV is hidden extremely well.

Overall this is just a wonderful, special beer. I would love to get this fresh on tap some day."
3475,QuakeAttack,Tap 6: Mein Aventinus,4.43,"Dam, why haven't I known about this beer before? I tired a 10oz pour at Grace in Growlers and can understand the love for this beer. Orange, brown with a mild head. Wheaty, malty, not too sweet. More please!"
3476,tekstr1der,Tap 6: Mein Aventinus,4.76,"When something's this delicious I just don't care about by rDev, rating-to-style, etc. Amazing sauce, perfectly balanced, incredible mix of wheat and sweet, no booziness, and a finish that makes me want more. I could drink this endlessly. Simply superb."

3478,ZebulonXZogg,Tap 6: Mein Aventinus,4.17,"Poured into an 8oz glass from Mackeys Beer Festival, a clear reddish brown pour and a great big foamy head. Snot factory like the warm baked bread, a bit of dark fruit maybe a bit of toffee, taste is similar. Creamy feel, smooth, nicely carbonated. Not very familiar with the style, so I will have to keep an eye out for these. A truly excellent beer."

L - Pours dark reddish brown with 2 fingers of tan head that dissipates slowly.
S - Smells sweet and malty.
T - Nice and malty with some banana and clove.
F - Medium body and carbonation.
O - Delicious Weizenbock."
3481,JZH1000,Tap 6: Mein Aventinus,4.14,"500mL bottle with the new nonsense date code.

On the pour 2 fingers of off white to tan head that became rocky and a bit foamy over a few minutes, until finally settling at a decent tan cap. Body is a dark amber to copper, with a bit of haze, but light still comes through.

Aroma carries sweet fig and toffee/caramel, but there is a slight savory oxidation thing going on. Alcohol isnoticeable, but not boozy.

Taste follows the sweet malty notes, but loses the off notes. I'm going to blame the aroma on bottle age, which for now is unfortunately uncontrollable. Traditional banana hefeweizen flavor comes through with a sweet caramelized flavor coming from the malts. Honestly very easy to drink and comes off as a Dunkelweizen to my untrained American palate. Still there is some light figgy fruit going on but this is mostly a very enjoyable dark, strong, traditional tasting hefeweizen. Nice balancing hop bitterness, but no hop aromas.


Feel is smooth and easy drinking. This beer hides its ABV well once it's on your palate. Slight astringency, but this isn't a dry beer. At the same time this beer doesn't come off as huge and thick. The astringency balances the malt well leading to the easy drinking feel of this. Medium long finish, but it's subtle. Soft subtle, but present, carbonation.

Overall there are flaws, but this is one of my favorite general doppelbock style beers I've ever had, although, it is the only weizen-doppelbock I've tried. Nice traditional hefeweizen flavor merged with delicious caramel sweet malts, as well as a nice balancing bitterness. Smells a bit funny when it gets old though."
3482,AZgman,Duet,4.25,A very good beer that blends a pair of hops to create a balanced IPA. Poured from a 12 oz can obtained from my local Total Wine it does taste fresh enough and is quite good.
3483,tt100,Duet,3.92,One of my go to IPAs whenever I was out west back years ago. So nice to find it here in LV (Total Wine). Hard to find out East for me. Simcoe and Amarillo hops. Great representation of the West Coast style
3484,MonDak_Joe1953,Duet,4.32,"12oz can. Can bottom is stamped 'BEST BY 04/17/23 BATCH 033B'.
Mostly clear, pale gold colored body. One thick finger of white head, but this retreats quickly to a puffy cap and ring. Leaves behind partial walls of lacing.
Aroma is as advertised with pine, citrus, and a true note of cedar.
Taste has a solid malt base over which hops express flavors of generic citrus and pine. Sweet and woody cedar also. Slight bitterness picks up in the aftertaste.
Medium mouth feel, with a drying aspect. Very good carbonation.
Savors as a classic IPA in the West Coast style."
3485,AphidRuin,Duet,4.07,"Pour deep yellowish-orange with a white head that lingers long. Smells mildly of pine and citrus. Tastes heavily of hops, but delicately balanced with sugar sweetness. Mouthfeel is dry and a tad too bitter. Overall, a beer that should be a IPA standard."
3486,AdmiralOzone,Duet,4.06,"Pours a cloudy straw yellow with a thick long-lasting white head that leaves generous lacing. Aroma is faint, citrus and pine. Flavor is bolder than the aroma. Feel is medium bodied and could use a bit more carbonation IMO. Overall, a decent enough beer."
3487,JohnniEMc,Duet,3.71,"This episode involved emptying two twelve ounce cans into a clear glass liter mug. The pours produced an overabundance of white foam on the top of a bright and light amber liquid. This one is about as translucent as any beer with a reasonable color can get. The aroma is mostly of hops, resinous and piney in character. It's not particularly rich. There's much less hop bite to taste than expected. What is there mixes poorly with whatever starch combination was used. There's an unpleasant, almost soapiness to taste until the finish. At least then, the Simcoe hops kick in and provide some clean and dry bitterness. All that foam and no glass lacing bears witness that this is short on body for an alleged IPA. On a positive note, the 7% ABV is nicely delivered. That should complete the compliments."
3488,ChainGangGuy,Duet,3.82,"Appearance: Pours a hazy, orange-yellow body with a modestly-sized, foamy, white head. Light lacing.

Smell: Pulped citrus supremes, pith powder, stonefruit juices, an unctuous drizzle of pine sap and a grassy herbaceousness.

Taste: Kicks of with a lean, light biscuit-innards maltiness, with things going pretty dry and pretty bitter quickly. Pithy citrus, a charged grassy element and a touch of PNW pine resin rounded everso slightly by pineapple and peach. Staunchly bitter making for a nigh austerely dry, potently bitter finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium carbonation.

Overall: Not bad."
3489,BalancingBrooms,Duet,4.03,"Golden orange with chill haze and a one finger white head. Nose is orange, tangerine, and some sugar. Taste follows the nose with a nice bite of grapefruit, orange, and tangerine pith and flesh followed by a short hint of pale malt. Body is light to medium with similar carbonation. Ends with a bitter citrus nuttiness. Overall not a bright as I thought it would be but solid characteristics. Maybe an older can? Cans says best by 12/22/22 and I’m opening it 9/2/22. Not sure how old it is?"
3490,Brumaster77,Duet,4.59,"A well balanced citrusy IPA with a mixture of Pine and cedar notes. Displays a lighter orange color with nice head and nice citrus aromas. From the first sip you can taste the citrus, which was soon followed by the pine. This beer paired well on a warm day and was easily followed by a second. Exactly what I remembered from a west coast IPA."
3491,RyanK252,Sanctification,4.18,"Bottle poured into a snifter

A: Pours slightly hazy golden yellow with a frothy off white head that settles out and leaves a little spotty lacing.

S: Light funk, grassy, mild spice, pleasant tartness, a little citrus, white grape, and some crackery biscuity malt.

T: Pleasant green apple tartness, grassy, citrus zest, lemon and lime, slightly spicy Brett funk, hints of white grape and under ripe pineapple, crackery biscuity malt, with a nice dry finish.

M: A bit on the lighter side of medium body, moderate carbonation.

O: I haven't had many Brett beers, but I'm really enjoying this one. Bright and refreshing, definitely not as funky as some of the others I've tried."
3492,Prager62,Sanctification,4.07,"Dated 05/30/14 and stored in a box down in the dark cool basement. Poured in a fluted glass for a quick review. 

A sparkling dark gold pour that produces zero foam and nary a carbonation bubble. The weak cork pop kind of gave away the carbonation deficiency. The smell is mostly brett funk and some light fruit. A taste that begins with white grapes followed by some brett funk and a hint of musty wood. The feel is slightly acidic and dry. 

Overall I'd say it has aged gracefully for being 9+ years old. A little more carbonation would have been nice but it's drinking very well on a 90 degree afternoon."
3493,Sludgeman,Sanctification,4.4,"From a 375 ml bottle for $20 (pricey) at Monks in Philly. Poured into a tulip-like glass. Bottled on 090517

In my opinion more sour than Brett. Straddling the line. 4.25

A - Pours a clear very pale golden yellow with an almost zero head, which faded quickly to just a thin constant ring around the glass. 4.25

S – Brett aromas with some minor funk and a good amount of stomach acid sourness. Minor citrus notes. 4.25

T - Tart but not overly sour or mouth puckering. Faint sweetness when coupled with the tartness reminds me of an oddly carbonated lemonade. No metallic or minerally feel like I get in some sours. 4.5

MF - Medium light body with a dry tart finish. 4.75"

Pours a crystal clear light golden in color, the picture looks more hazy because it's humid and there was instant condensation. Bight pillowy head that condenses down to a thin cap, but great head retention, and leaves rings of lacing on the glass. Bright slightly tart lemon aroma, a touch of grassy funk. Taste starts with crackery pale malt, in the middle hits some floral and citrus notes, then finishes quite dry. Thinner bodied, effervescent lively carbonation. Overall very nice, seems deserving of it's #3 spot on the Top Rated list of Brett Beers."
3495,pthoolihan,Sanctification,4.11,"Pours clear with a lot of bubbles, a 2 finger head. Smells rich, like it’s aged in wine barrels. Tastes like Carbonated dry with a little bitterness. Dry feel, more dry than a Chardonnay."

Smells of fresh raspberries, sour apple, lemon zest, bing cherry, red wine vinegar, honeyed pastries and some pleasant barnyard funk.

Tastes of sour raspberry candies, more tart lemon and apple, sharp red wine, biscuity and crackery caramel and wheat malt and more horsey barnyard funk.

Feels light and fresh and sour. Light bodied with prickly carbonation. Finishes sour.

The beer has a two finger tall dense fizzy foamy pale pink colored head that quickly reduces to a large patch of thin film covering the entire surface of the beer and thin ring at the edges of the glass. Minimal amounts of lacing are observed.

S: Slightly stronger than moderate aromas of slightly sour wheat + pale malts with minimal amounts of sweetness. Moderate aromas of slightly sour lacto lemon citrus along with a moderate aroma of slightly funky barnyard + horse blanket. Light aromas of tart raspberries.

T: Upfront there are moderate flavors of slightly sour wheat + pale malts with minimal amounts of sweetness. That is followed by slightly stronger than moderate flavors of slightly sour lacto lemon citrus and slightly stronger than moderate flavors of funky barnyard + horse blanket. Finally there are light to moderate flavors of tart raspberries. Moderate amounts of lingering acidic tartness.

M: Light bodied with moderate to heavy amounts of carbonation. Moderate to heavy amounts of acidic prickliness.

This is my first beer from De Struise. I've heard great things about them over the years, specifically about Pannepot. When I saw my store got a drop of their beers I knew I had to grab one of everything. I figured this was the best beer to introduce myself to them with. Let's pop it open and see what it's all about

Pours an opaque medium brown with just a few small beige bubbles and leaves no lacing. A bit of sediment floating around as well

The nose is sweet and fruity as expected, but there's a faint tartness that's giving it some edge. I'm picking up on aromas of brown sugar, molasses, red grape, overripe banana, tannic red wine, caramel, tart cherry, cocoa powder, and leather

The tartness almost evolves into something funky in taste, making this quite unique. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting brown sugar, overripe banana, dark bread, raisin, toffee, black cherry, tobacco, and light molasses. The swallow brings notes of tannic red wine, old leather, prune, brown sugar, molasses, tart cherry, tobacco, cocoa powder, and light toffee

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a zippy beer. Finishes bone dry with a refreshing tartness

Complex, deep, and wonderful, it bears a striking relationship with its cousin tasted and enjoyed back in October.

Frankly, I am in love with how rugged the flavor complexion is of this throw back stout: roasted and earthy malt with accents of smoky coffee, tobacco and earth, meet dark chocolate and black strap molasses on the second half that just glob onto the palate. Taste is just that tick more intense while still being drinkable. Which brings me to the feel, mirroring the taste, strong roast but refined by the finish with the bright sweetness of the molasses, robust yet smooth and quaffable."

12oz bottle served in a footed pilsner glass. Bottle says ""Freshest by 042624."" @jonphisher sent it to me.

Pours clear dark amber, big fluffy head that settles fairly quickly into a thick, dense skin, clinging to the glass in thick webby lacing a good inch and a half above the surface. Smell is pine and citrus hops with a background of toffee and earthy bitter.

Taste is following the promising nose very nicely. Toffee, light biscuit, earthiness come forward a little bit. Toffee sweetness is definitely there. Pine and citrus are clearly there, balancing nicely with everything else.

Mouthfeel is light, clean, and dry. Overall, this is really nice, lots going on, very well-balanced."
3528,FRANKHAZE,Nugget Nectar,4.26,"Beautiful copper red, tastes of citrus, piney malty goodness. Nice bittering end. Light mouthfeel. Great ale."
3529,mcgiants,Nugget Nectar,4.35,"Just learning that this is a Red Ale and not an IPA. I have drank many over the years and always thought an IPA.

Anyway.... 12 oz bottle poured into a tulip glass.

Pours a beautiful copper with nice head. Can see the carbonation. Smell, taste/feel: Malty with hoppy bitterness. Very, very nice.

Troegs does really great work."

Poured a clear copper color into a Samuel Smith Imperial pint glass with visible carbonation and a frothy white head that lingered & left loads of lacing. Earthy pine resinous overtones in aroma with hints of tangerine, peach, apricot, tropical fruits and malty goodness. Flavor follows nose with a nice malty bitter-sweet backbone for a finish. Sits mid to back of palate with slight carbonation tingle on the tongue. A little past it's prime but this is the last one I was saving to see if it changed with age. Remember it pretty much the same; an outstanding offering from Tröegs. World class indeed."

Malty, soft and smooth with hints of tropical fruit. Aroma follows the palate, but with more emphasis on the orange zest. Mouthfeel is crisp and highly drinkable, but still relatively full bodied and rich.

3536,Sigmund,Beer Geek Brunch Weasel,4.22,"500 ml bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. Brewed by Mikkeller at Nøgne Ø, Norway. Batch #418, ABV is 10.9%. Pitch black colour, huge chocolate brown head. Lovely aroma of dark roasted malts, coffee and chocolate, hints of dark fruits. Intense flavour of coffee (can’t say if the ""weasel"" coffee was worth the price, though), also a massive malty sweetness and a solid roasty and hoppy bitterness, lasting through the long aftertaste. Not for sissies."
3537,dpgrifs,Beer Geek Brunch Weasel,4.54,"Pours a very dark chocolate color. Almost no foam present. 
Aroma of malt, coffee, and bourbon. 
The taste of coffee and roasted malts with bourbon flavor very present."
3538,Jack_14,Beer Geek Brunch Weasel,3.28,"Fresh roasting on the nose.
Color impenetrable black.
Foam beige, evanescent even if the beer is poured vertically.
In the mouth there is a clear prevalence of toasted niote and coffee that also hide hints of chocolate and a hint of tobacco.
Non-existent carbonation.
But given the light body (too watery for my personal taste) it really feels like a brew of coffee.
I was expecting a beer with a different body honestly, but to taste it did not disappoint."
3539,BloodSoakedAleMug,Beer Geek Brunch Weasel,2.22,"Look: Pours a very, very pitch black color with a tiny, quarter finger head of beige foam. No lacing on the glass.

Aroma: Slightly chalky, herbal and bittersweet. An unpleasant soy sauce note is the first thing that jumps out at me. Lots of milk chocolate, semi-tart candied raisins and coffee beans. Some burnt toast and marzipan. Bourbon is in the background, a tepid medicinal, woody, resinous aroma. I think that's whats giving the beer it's ""chalkiness"" I was describing earlier. Cloying.

Taste: Very complex, a little too complex maybe? There's a lot to the beer and I'm afraid it all gets lost in translation. It's boozy, not atypical of a 11%er, but . . . it's just all over the place. The taste isn't bad, but it's very tannic and hard to take more than a tablespoon of a sip at a time, without your palate being completely overpowered by this herbal, sour, medicinal aftertaste. There's a nice cola and coffee flavor but it's so brief, before sickly sweet notes of chocolate syrup overpower everything. Then it becomes almost medicinal and woody. . . . and my god that aftertaste of sour soy sauce and grape juice. Yuck.

Feel: The worst part about it. Dry. Sweet. Slimy. Sticky. Oily. Thin. Hot. Boozy. Chalky. Not a fan. I would never be able to tell this was brewed with oatmeal until I read it on the bottle. 

Overall: Maybe I got a bad batch. Mikkeler is usually on point but this is a classic example of one of the downsides of gypsy brewing; quality control. For such a complex beer where so much can go wrong, when you're using such an obscure ingredient like ca phe chon coffee . . . you really need to tripple check you dotted your ""i""s and cross your ""t""s so to say. . . Something was just off and didnt click here. I couldn't finish my bottle. . . sad to say this was a drain pour."

Smell has an upfront chocolate maltball note, goes down easy enough with a nice coffee kick in the back of the throat afterwards. Looks just about as good as any breakfast stout, nothing crazy, will a fleeting caramel-mocha head from a vigorous pour into a tulip. Well done, check it out if you see it."

Black colored body, with just a smidge of a dark brown edge when back lit. No read head upon pouring, what sticks around is a small island and thin ring, both fed by rising bubbles. Leaves behind some lacing spots, most of which slide back down into the beer.
Aroma is of dark roasted malts, but this one has a hint of sweetness. Heavy coffee, with additions of subtle smoke, chocolate and dark fruits.
Taste is quite heavy, with its dark roasted malts and coffee. Also expresses chocolate and dark fruit. This one has a hint of smoke but no allusion to grilled meats.
Heavy mouth feel, with a mouth coating sensation. Okay carbonation.
For a higher ABV% beer, the alcohol is well hidden. As the beer warms, at times, it expresses a sensation reminiscent of cherry cola (but ensconced in rich and deep coffee). The after taste has more decadent chocolate than in the main taste profile. The beer has a forbidding appearance because of its lack of foam, but the overall aroma, taste, and mouth feel is very much of a treat."

Dark reddish plum body with no head until the last pour which turns the body muddy brown.

Light tart aroma.

This one comes under the heading, don't judge a book by its cover. The look and faint aroma didn't promise much, but the taste certainly delivered. Strongly sour and tart, lots of dark skinned fruit, sweetness buzzes in and out. Abv invisible, could not believe it's an 11.0.

Mouth closer to medium than full, finish a fruit laden drying sourness.

Overall, excelled Flanders Red. Sorry I went with the smaller bottle."
3546,Beersnake,Abbaye De Saint Bon-Chien,4.25,"2019 bottle poured at fridge temp but allowed to warm for a while (serving temp is 61 to 64 F). Pours a dark orange/light brown with ZERO head. The nose is intense and insanely good. Tons of sour and funk. Tart. Sour cherries peaches, red wine, lemon, floral, and rhubarb. 

The taste is really interesting. The lack of carbonation really makes it punch hard. Tart cherries, lemon peel, funk, sour, oak, red wine, and a slight nutty flavor. Really nice. The alcohol is high but not detectable in any way. 

Mouthfeel is medium bodied - low carbonation and dry. Very enjoyable."
3547,Edgewise,Abbaye De Saint Bon-Chien,4.84,"This is my favorite sour, hands down. The mouthfeel is reminiscent of champagne, despite the slender head, and the nose is yeasty with a note of oak. But the flavor is where it truly excels, reminding me of a very fine wine tinged with unripened mango. It's hard to do it justice with words. I could drink St. Good Dog all day, if I could only get my hands on a regular supply."

3549,Roy_Hobbs,Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Barleywine,3.8,"I'm finally getting around to drinking this beer, just short of its 8th birthday (bottled in early 2016). 

First impression is favorable, as the glowing amber color on the pour was very enticing, and there was a surprising amount of (admittedly short-lived) head. Aroma similarly impresses with plenty of brown sugar and sweet molasses. 

My first impression of the taste & feel is that.....I'm not sure what I think. It struck me as a little watery initially, and the flavor profile didn't jump out at me. As I drink more of it, what I'm noticing is that a) there is more barrel than I was anticipating (and in a good way), and that there is a brilliant alcohol warming on what ends up being a long finish. Much less rich than the aroma implied. Hard to know if the notes I picked up on the nose have faded over time in terms of the taste. 

Overall, this is an enjoyable beer."

Bourbon Barrel Barleywine Ale – Brewers Reserve body is a hazy dark brown almost amber in color. A ½ finger kaki head was produced.

The taste has flavors of caramel, dark fruit, and brown sugar followed by bourbon, then a hoppy light bitter lingering finish.

This is getting up there in age. I always wish I would have tasted one of these aged bottles versus fresh to see what's changed, but I only have the old one. AT any rate, this is an amazing beer. So smooth and complex on the nose and pallet. It's all caramely goodness with tons of booze. But it's so smooth. As usual with these Brewers Reserve, they could be thicker for me in appearance and while drinking. it's not a huge distraction though. A world class beer but not on the level of the very VERY best barleywines for me. There might not be anything better though for the price."

Aroma is toffee, raisins, molasses and caramel with toasty, caramely, earthy malts behind. Bourbon adds a little swell of heat, but it's not much. Char cuts the bravado from the initial sweetness, shifting the end of the nose to a rather sharp cutoff. Flavor profile is molasses, fig, toffee and chocolate all dipped into sweet caramel. Toasty, nutty and caramely malts add base while bourbon adds a little tangy heat and substance to the sweetness. Mouth feel is medium-thick with a firm effervescence. Overall, sugary and sweet - sure - but bourbon swoops in to add a drop of heat and enough dryness to soak it all up. Dynamic and flavorful.

12 FLUID OZ brown glass bottle from 2019
$4.79 @ Shop Rite Wine & Spirits, Cherry Hill, NJ

Notes via stream of consciousness: It's poured a very hazy deep chestnut colored brown body beneath a short head of khaki colored foam. The aroma is quite rich with malt and oak. It's woody and toasty with some Bourbon and butter cookie notes over medium-dark caramel and crusty bread that's topped with warm nuts and drizzled with molasses. (That actually took me some time to put together, so it's not exactly stream of consciousness.) Wow, what a great aroma... let's see how it tastes... well there's some alcohol to it, that's for sure, and it's not as rich as the aroma suggests. The alcohol cuts through the malt straight away and follows through to a dry, semi-hot finish that leaves some bitterness lingering. So how strong is this? I'm not finding anything listed on the label. Ahh, their website says 13.8% and I can believe that. It's a bit much I think. Back to the taste, there's some raisin, brown sugar, and coconut in there as well. I appreciate that this is not too sweet, but at the same time I find it a little too dry with bitterness (80 IBUs) and alcohol ~ mainly the alcohol. In the mouth it's medium-full and moderately zesty. The head didn't hold up very well, and as you might have expected given that, the lacing was limited. Overall I think it's a decent enough after-dinner sipper but it's not the best that it could be.

3558,krh,Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Barleywine,4.12,"I'm probably ranking this too low for the style, but a bit too much for me. Choosing to sit down with this is akin to skipping another cocktail, rather than a beer. Boozy thickness throughout, warms the chest. Just a bit to syrupy for me."
3559,Lingenbrau,Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Barleywine,4.24,"CWs Barleywine pours a slightly muddled brown tinted by caramel and fiery orange highlights. A thin khaki foam develops then descends into a creamy looking hairline hugging the perimeter of the glass. A film swirls in the center.

Bold aroma dominated by burnt brown sugar with molasses folded gently in. A splash of vanilla and pre-baked cinnamon rolls are finished off with damp oak.

Sweet, caramel drizzled figs are quickly displaced by bitter dried orange peel. The oak and bourbon are intense, and the alcohol flavor lasts the entirety between sips. Mulling spices come in and out, but develop as it warms.

Pretty rich, silky feel which ends up being an afterthought to the boozy warmth. The sugary sap coats the lips while a burn and bitter bite fill the chest and mouth.

This is a sipper with an enormous alcohol presence. Delicious throughout and a real treat. Central Waters delivers another beauty from the Brewers Reserve Series."

Boozy, fruity aroma dominates roasted malts.

3564,tobelerone,Gouden Carolus Cuvée Van De Keizer Imperial Dark,4.3,"Can’t believe I haven’t rated this classic before. I’ve definitely had it in the past but not for years so I picked up a nicely priced (10.99) corked and caged 750, bottled in 2021.

This beer looks phenomenal, with a very dark brown body (approaching black) and a tan head of tightly clustered bubbles that retains strongly and leaves creamy sheeting on the inside of the glass. The smooth fullness of the body, with moderate carbonation, is also a very high point. I was actually surprised at the restrained effervescence as for me it’s dead on and lively without getting too spritzy which I’ve encounter with many other Belgian beers. I actually uncorked this near the sink to be on the safe side but no issues whatsoever there. 

Nose is the weaker side of this beer, nothing bad here but simply understated and mild, hints of dark chocolate, bready malt, restrained alcohol, raisin. On the palate the alcohol is again present but contained in a very pleasant way, sweet dark fruit and chocolate predominant, subtler vinous qualities and suggestion of baking spices. Unfolds gradually revealing depths of flavor as it warms.

What a treat. I love to mix it up with an old school European classic now and then and this fit the bill fantastically on a chilly early spring evening."

Taste: Broiled brown sugar and treacle with a dash of chocolate powder - soundly sweet. Dark bready, toasted quality. A hint of vanilla with spicy touches of cinnamon, mace and pepper aided by the firm, mature, guiding hands of the warming alcohol presence. Dark fruitiness accented with some berry notes.

Looks very nice. Almost black body, deep red wine when held up to the light. Decent tan head, replenishes well with each pour. Does shrink to a ring and faint covering, great lacing.

Sweet caramel aroma, lots of dark skinned fruit a touch of alcohol.

On tasting, first off, it's certainly on the sweet side, caramel and boiled candy. However, there are enough nuances to cut through this. Dark skin fruit, warming, and more to come in the finish.

Mouth a little foamy, close to full. Finish very complex. Sweet caramel to be sure, but the warmth, fruit, dryness, even a light bitter touch are all enjoyed.

Taste was pretty average, with the hops truly starring, but wasn't super memorable beyond the hops. Somewhat bready in feel with the hop textures interceding. Good ipa, but nothing outstanding"
3578,drdiesel9483,Oude Kriek,4.27,"Look - dark red purple plum color with slight head nice rimming
Smell and taste - really nice tart dark cherry and dry
Feel - medium body and carb
Overall - outstanding"
3579,Beejay,Oude Kriek,3.33,"A: cranberry cookies with almost no head.

S: super funky smell. Like Stinky cheese and shoes, with BO on top.

T: thank Christ it doesn't taste like it smells. Very tart with cherry and a touch of funk in the background.

M: light and crisp with moderate carbonation. 

O: overall I love the flavor, but the aroma is rough. I like it, but don't know if I'd drop the coin on it again."
3580,HattedClassic,Oude Kriek,4.44,"The beer pours very little next to no head without a hard pour. The beer itself is an opaque dark reddish purple that looks like a plum.

The smell is wonderful. It has a strong and tart dark cherry smell with an orange woody note at the end.

The taste is wonderful. It has a strong tart dark cherry flavor with a light sour note.

The feel is good. It has a medium body with a jamlike texture to it and very little carbonation. The acidity is tolerable, it's about the same level as an orange.

Overall, this is a fantastic beer worth getting and having on a warm day. It isn't overly challenging to the palate and good for people who enjoy lambics or looking to try one out."
3581,detgfrsh,Oude Kriek,4.29,"From a bottle, season 19|20. Cloudy red color with no head. Sour cherry smell. Medium body and a slick feel. Tart cherry and some floral notes with a sour finish. Classic example of the style"
3582,beergoot,Oude Kriek,4.3,"Cloudy, purple body; nice initial head on first pour that quickly fades to nearly nothing except a faint circular wisp around the perimeter of the glass. A nice musty, fruity aroma; a very faint touch of horse blanket. A wonderfully balanced flavor of cherry sourness, low-key alcohol, and a touch of earthy woodiness; mild to moderate tartness counterbalanced with a moderate fruit sweetness; a smidge of wheat in the background. Medium body; nice mouth puckering tartness, not too intense and nicely offsets the cherry sweetness.

This is just an incredible beer. The blending and barrel-aging artfully melds together some great flavors and produces a sublime mouthfeel.

Pouring temperature: 49 °F; bottling info: BOTTLING DATE 10 OCT 18, BEST BEFORE 26 OCT 28, Blend n° 83 · season 17|18
Additional info: macerated for 5 months, lambics originate from 4 different barrels and 5 different brews"
3583,lucat,Oude Kriek,4.87,"Smells like a classy parfume. The aspect remembers the ""oinopa ponton"", the wine-dark see, that Homer sings in the odyssey. The taste became more and more complex and satisfying while I was drinking it. It's a quite good balance of flavour, alcool, sour and fruit"
3584,Rug,Oude Kriek,4.44,"Blend 32, Season 18|19, Bottled 1/23/19

It’s funny, just last night I had Allagash’s Coolship Cerise, an Americanized Kriek. Now it’s time to have an authentic Belgian version of the style. I’ve been picking up more of these 3 Fonteinen bottles I see on the shelves because they’re pretty much always available for a decent price given what they are, and they never disappoint. Let’s get into this one

Pours a slightly cloudy ruby red with a finger of pinkish white head that quickly fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing

The cherries are definitely front and center in the nose, but there’s a malty vibe that makes it feel like a funky pie. I’m picking up on aromas of sour cherry, graham cracker, lemon juice, wet hay, pie crust, apple skin, buttery oak, and light tangerine

It has just as much of a cherry presence in taste, but the tartness is even more focused. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting tart black cherry, sharp oak, wheat bread, vanilla, juicy strawberry, lemon juice, and crabapple. The swallow brings notes of tart black cherry, pie crust, lemon juice, wheat bread, cinnamon, vanilla, sharp oak, wet hay, and light apple skin

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a sharp yet smooth beer. Finishes mostly dry and very refreshing

Oh yeah, this one is great. It goes down ridiculously easy but still has a wild complexity to it"
3585,IKR,Oude Kriek,4.34,"Blend n` 71 season 17/18

Appearance: Clear red color with no head but a few bubbles that quickly disappeared. 

Smell: Moderate barnyard and some tart apple and cherries aromas.

Taste: Tart cherry notes feature upfront in the flavor profile, followed by tart citrus notes, and some faint grassy/hay notes. While the cherries are noticeable there is no sweetness observed unlike many fruited wild ales. The beer finish is dry.

Mouth-feel: Fairly light-bodied with a low level of carbonation, appropriate for the style.

Overall: A good fruit Lambic. The flavor profile incorporates the cherries nicely and comes off very smooth."
3586,Rug,Pannepot Reserva,3.93,"Brewed 12/3/19, bottled 1/25/22

I had the OG Pannepot for the first time last week and was quite impressed. I’m not sure that aging in a bourbon barrel is the best way to improve that particular beer, but I’m intrigued by it nonetheless. Let’s pop it open and find out what it has to offer

Pours an opaque medium brown with just a few small beige bubbles and leaves no lacing. A bit of sediment floating around as well

The bourbon is definitely forward in the nose, but there’s a nice balance to it. I’m picking up on aromas of sweet bourbon, baked apple, brown sugar, red grape, toffee, molasses, overripe banana, and light leather

It thins out in a strange way in taste, taking a funky turn. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting apple skin, brown sugar, sweet bourbon, caramel, red wine vinegar, dark bread, and light molasses. The swallow brings notes of sweet bourbon, candy apple, red wine vinegar, molasses, burnt caramel, black cherry, and brown sugar

A light medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a slick and thin beer. Finishes truly neutral

This one is quite odd, but I still kinda fuck with this"
3587,malrubius,Pannepot Reserva,4.41,Dark brown with amber highlights barely any head. Boozy woody portlike tannens aroma. Sweet per style brown sugar maple syrup with some tannin acidity and woody spicy like jaegar finish. Not sure what to call that? Clovey? Full body low very fine carbo.

De Struise Brouwers Belgian Strong Dark Ale

The classic Belgian, Reserve style: Vintage 3/12/2019. Opened 10/29/23. Rich, earthy tones of dried leaves, sweet figs, grapes, and smooth, then dry, oak complexity. Sweet, tangy and dry all at once. Dark malts with earthy hops and tangy yeast is deep."
3589,MikeWard,Pannepot Reserva,4.19,"330ml bottle into a small glass. 2012 vintage. Very dark brown body with plum highlights. Small bubbly head shrinks to a ring, no lacing.

3590,EmperorBevis,Pannepot Reserva,4.35,"Bottled and received in the post but so long ago I can’t remember from whom, but either from someone at Struise or a friend of somebody at Struise.
Pours a rich dark brown body with some good off white head 
Aroma is toffee and Christmas spice
Flavour is plums and a note of patchouli"

3592,LagerMan_US,Old Rasputin,4.59,"If you like stout - this one is top shelf.
All the signature, and creative, flavors of a complex stout delicately combined.
It's notably refined, especially given the high alcohol content."
3593,chrisiswhothisis,Old Rasputin,4.56,"Pours a thick, mousse-y, tan head; stays persistent.

Chocolate malt, coffee aroma.

Tastes of dark chocolate malt; almost no sweetness. Leans heavy on the bitterness of the dark malts.

Thick, bitter stout. Perfectly on style. Finishes dry.

The epitome of a Russian Imperial Stout."
3594,Luscious_Malfoy,Old Rasputin,4.28,"poured from a 12oz bottle into a SP BBT23 snifter. pours near- black but gathers in the glass a shiny black with almost two fingers of dark khaki colored foam. foam fades away but never fully disappears leaving a thick collar around the rim of the glass and a thin film across the top of the black liquid. cocoa powder, day-old gas station coffee, pine, pine sap and possibly even some citrus. taste is more pine, resin, light chocolate, coffee grounds and very light tobacco. i’m not so sure there isn’t an orange peel thing going on from the hops buts faint. thick mouthfeel but it has a nice brush of carbonation in the finish. really good stuff. i’ve had this before but it’s been 10-12 years at least. nice to revisit as this is about as classic as it gets with craft RIS’s and for glad to see this holds up over time. there is so much to appreciate in this beer."
3595,walser,Old Rasputin,3.98,"From AJ's Beer Warehouse in Rochester, NY. - a beer goldmine. 4 mo old can, out of wine glass. Lasting off white head, burgundy black color, very smooth mouth feel. Slippery notes of fig, cola and fading citrus. Very nice beer."
3596,QuietlyJudgingYou,Old Rasputin,4.69,"Appearance: Black with a thin ring of brown colored foam.
Smell: Dark chocolate, coffee beans, brown sugar, tangy, earthy.
Taste: Sourdough bread up front, quickly shifts to a coffee flavor, lots of charred malt make up most of the body, bittersweet chocolate on the finish. Sweetness is a tad lower than the bitterness. Leans more toward a charred taste than sweet.
Feel: Full bodied, well carbonated, a little oily with very little alcohol warmth in the back of the throat.
Overall: True to style and delicious. Possibly my favorite stout.

Opinion: As it continues to get more difficult to find a stout that isn't dominated by adjuncts or bourbon barrel flavors Old Rasputin continues to shine as a well made no gimmicks stout."
3597,BGDrock,Old Rasputin,4.38,"Just about a pitch black body, a rich espresso foam head, dense with good retention of several minutes. 
Aroma is mild, of dark roast chocolate, dark cherry (black forest cake), a hint of black licorice.
Wonderfully pure roast malt flavour, rich with deep dark cocoa and bold dark roast coffee, a touch of milkly sweetness balancing it out the restrained bitterness; in the finish it's like a mocha gelato, with some nuttiness; very fine carbonation and medium body lends a sumptuous silky feel; low residual sweetness for the style, which I often find cloying.

An ode to roast malt, it's beautifully balanced and surprising quaffable. A very pure example of the style."

3600,Seanc59,Old Rasputin,5,This is a complete evening beverage Full flavored and loaded with body. Fine craftsmanship at its best.
3601,TominPA,Old Rasputin,3.99,"Old Rasputin was my first introduction to Russian Imperial Ale many years ago. I have consistently gone back to its rich malt flavors balanced with espresso coffee bitterness. This particular tasting is from last year's bottled stock. The head was thinner, but present and persists through the first 1/3 of the session, Lacing is thin and not prominent. Appearance is classic dark brown/black and very appealing. This ale does not hit you with a lot of malt sweetness on the palate and is balanced with bitterness that tends to espresso coffee rather than dark chocolate. After-taste fades fairly quickly for a big beer like this. Alcohol is present but not overwhelming and there is no burn. I tend to drink a lot of imperial ale and higher ABV beers, so your results may vary. I really like this and it will remain a regular go-to beer, but more recent entries to the Russian Imperial class exceed my original favorite. Still a favorite when I'm ready to go dark and deep into malt flavor."

3604,Ozzylizard,Plead The 5th Imperial Stout,4.29,"Plead the 5th from Dark Horse Brewing. 12 oz bottle. Stored at 34 degrees at home. Received from @Whyteboar in NBW BIF #16. Reviewed 07/12/22. Note that I use DD/MM/YY protocol.
Undated bottle. Served at 53.7 degrees in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. The final temperature was 58.1 degrees. 
Appearance – 3.5.
First pour – Amber Brown (SRM 18), clear.
Body – Brown (SRM 20), opaque. Under direct light, same, but much precipitate is present. When rear lite, opaque except at the edges – ruby and translucent. 
Head – Average (Maximum 1.2 cm, aggressive center pour), brown sugar, high density with many surface rocks, quickly diminishing to a 0.35 – 0.5 cm low-density crown and a thin island.
Lacing – Surprisingly, a fair amount, extremely tiny bubbles forming a few small coronas. More than expected at 11% ABV.
Aroma – 4.5 – Chocolate, weak char, and a hint of coffee. No hops, no yeast.
Flavor – 4.5 – Chocolate and slight char with a slightly bitter aftertaste. No hops or yeast. No ethanol (11 % ABV as marked on label) aroma or taste. Slight gastric warming occurs. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl. 
Palate – 4 – Full, dry, soft carbonation.
Final impression and summation: 4 (After deducting 0.25 point for undated personal container) Looks like every other RIS. Drinkability excellent, with nose and taste balanced, very smooth! Palate works well with the flavor."
3605,WoodBrew,Plead The 5th Imperial Stout,4.27,I am trying a can of this beer at my BRAH-in-law 's house whilst there for Thanksgiving. It poured an opaque dark with tan ring head that is not leaving any lace. The scent had dark chocolate and roast notes. The taste was nicely balanced and easy to sip. There was dark chocolate malt base with roast and espresso highlights. The mouthfeel was fuller in body and had good carbonation. Overall it is a solid beer.
3606,Beersnake,Plead The 5th Imperial Stout,4.28,"Older bottle - probably 5 years old. Pours motor oil black. The nose is tobacco, coffee, roasted malts, charred wood, smoke, and a bit of burnt toffee. Dark chocolate as well.

The taste is insanely good. Rich dark chocolate, burnt wood, earth, dark German bread, sponge toffee, French roast coffee beans, and some dark plums and cherries. Wow. Intense flavors. 

The mouthfeel is thick and creamy. This is just a super classic RIS with massive flavors. The aftertaste is flooded with roasted malts."

3615,turfy,Yeti - Barrel-Aged,4.01,"Canned Oct. 2021. Deep, dark brown, almost black body. 1.5 inch medium brown head. Fades to an eventual solid ring. Average lacing. Smell is strong chocolate, with whiskey and a little vanilla. Taste is of roasted malts, bitter chocolate and whiskey. A little lingering alcohol burn on the tongue. The more I sipped the less complex it seemed... mostly bitter roasted notes and alcohol. Medium carbonation. I would say just short of a medium body. Not thin but not as heavy as many other stouts. $12.99, so I probably would not buy again at that price. Maybe a little age will mellow it out some."

The feel is a touch on the thin side, with a medium amount of carbonation. Smooths out as it warms. Overall, a good post turkey day meal dessert."

My only complaint with these ales is the 11 ounce bottles. The bigger 750m are not always available.

As to price, compared to the average craft price of $7-8, you may get more beer down the street, but the quality taste of this far surpasses the best in our area. They all try some type of Belgium but cant touch the real things. 

Would love to buy another four pack asap."
3622,Tsar_Riga,Tripel Karmeliet,4.49,"A - Pours out golden from a 75 cL green bottle, with a dense white head that fades slowly to a thin cap. Lacing is present, with scattered white bubbles across the glass.

S - A punchy funk is present on the open, but once poured, the nose is more subtle, honeyed malt and spun sugar over some floral and grassy highlights, apple fruitiness, and just a bit of grape skin tannic notes beneath.

T - The front is bright, sweet, honey and malty lushness, apple juice through the middle, banana and stone fruit against a hint of peppery spiciness, turning to a tea-like bitterness over the continued honey notes in the finish.

M - Soft, with decent carbonation over a slightly slick feel on the tongue. The alcohol is well-hidden, but present in warmth as the beer trails to a clean close.

O - Hard to beat a Tripel as good as this - a big, bright malty pillow on which lies a variety of yeast-based flavor notes. I love this one, and will certainly pick up more for the future."

Just a supurb presentation. Big fluffy foam, solid blonde gold brew with active volcanic bubbles rising.
On the nose, it’s malty and peach, banana, malt, white pepper, an exotic orangey lemon hop note. (Is that Dubble Bubble way down in there?!?)
Oh yeah - it tastes like all that too. Rides from nose to brain to mouth. Oats bring a dreamy creamy texture that kinda melts its way down. Slovenian Styrian hops pack tight aromatic goodness. Subtle chant of alcohol cleans it all up in a short, crisp finish. Let’s go again.,. 
Mouthfeel is just short of Full. It has complimentary medium carbonation.

Lightly cloudy (initially) Naples yellow body supports a dense cosmic latte cap. Fine sticky lacing; excellent retention. Clarity improves as the beer warms/settles.

Yeast-forward aromatics - bread dough, pear, coriander/anise, and orange blossom. Spicy, floral, and inviting. 

Flavors follow the nose but are much more potent. Sweet, malty, with a mild but lasting grassy bitterness. Complex and faintly tart with a medium-dry finish with hints of pear brandy. 

Sticky, medium-bodied, with full carbonation. Alcohol forward, but not excessive.

Rating to style, this remains one of the best commercial examples."
3627,Ghrymm,Tripel Karmeliet,4.58,"Poured from a 330ml bottle.

3628,beerwithmeIRL,Rodenbach Grand Cru,4.68,"330ml Bottle - Pours darkish brown with a ruby-red hue and 1 finger off-white head that entirely dissipates with great rapidity. On the nose, straight up vinegar sour with a hint of caramel & dried fruits. On tasting, that trademark acid-tang sensation hits the tongue and opens up the tartness of sour fruits like cherry, apple & zesty orange. Complexity is added with hints of toffee, vanilla & even an indistinct tobacco-esque flavour. Always an incredible experience drinking this beer & I find it quite refreshing too. Top class."
3629,thehyperduck,Rodenbach Grand Cru,4.16,"330 mL bottle from the LCBO; best before 11/7/2025 and served slightly chilled.

Many Rodenbach beers are visually similar, and Grand Cru is no exception: it's coloured deep, clear burgundy-brown with ruby-red highlights. Half a finger of bubbly, sudsy, light tan-coloured head disintegrates well within two minutes' time, leaving behind a soapy collar and little else of interest. The aroma is a classic blend of oak, red wine vinegar and sour cherry, with added hints of vanilla, balsamic and some musty funk.

It's a quality red ale - fruity at first, with sour cherry, apple and red grape leading into notes of caramel, oak, red wine vinegar and subtle vanilla. Mild to moderate leathery, musty funkiness on the back end, with hints of balsamic and oak dissipating into the aftertaste. Medium in body, with fairly lively carbonation that adds some spritz to this red ale's otherwise smooth mouthfeel. Good drinkability, relatively speaking - this bottle is close to the perfect serving size.

Final Grade: 4.16, an A-. Rodenbach Grand Cru is one of the only Flanders red ales that has been easily accessible year-round in my neck of the woods, at least for the last half-decade. I have enjoyed it on a sporadic basis ever since, but the truth is that while I really *love* this style once in a while - there's just nothing else like it - I don't have the desire to drink 'em on a daily or even weekly basis. Grand Cru does come off as a bit of a wallflower, sandwiched between their bolder ""Vintage"" series, and their more approachable fruited sour ales such as Alexander and Caractère Rouge. It's still an excellent beer, and well worth seeking out if you develop an interest in Flemish sours - it's not the gold standard of the style, but silver? I could see that - in fact, the label is already the correct colour!"
3630,Mindcrime1000,Rodenbach Grand Cru,4.25,"Poured into a tulip. 

Pours clear dark brown with garnet highlights. Excellent tan foamy head. Limited head. Excellent lacing. 

Detectable to strong acidity on the nose with dark fruit and caramel sugar notes. Perhaps some orange peel.

The flavor is complex and refined. Acidic but not overpoweringly so. Excellent balance with sweeter flavors of apple, raisin, and a bit of oaking. The mature beer portion of this blend is what keeps the restraint just right.

Like the flavor, the feel is well balanced. Not drying but not sticky either. Vanishing carbonation. The first few sips have a fair amount; it subsides into tart smoothness quickly.

For my personal taste, this brew may be a shade sweet and tame for the style, but that's also the level of restraint the brewer was intentionally pursuing. Nailed it to say the least."
3631,Effinwill,Rodenbach Grand Cru,4.79,"poured from the bottle into Belgian tulips. It's too cold for critical tasting but I didn't want wait. My wife loves sours so I've tried many over the years.
L: muddy river water, hazy brown, not the look I'd be shooting for, but we don't drink beer with our eyes
S: beautiful. you can smell the acid forthwith, accompanied by caramel or toffee, a box of raisins, maybe some orange peel
T: racy acidity. Sour orange, raisins and toffee. Long sour finish. Elegant stuff compared to the kettle sours you find sometimes at brewpubs. Not as serious and complex as our best wild ales. Somewhere in between.
F: appropriate weight. Any more malt and it would be a mess. Definitely not too thin.
O: a fun treat - glad someone came up with this style of beer back in the dark ages. They built some beautiful gothic cathedrals too, so maybe not too dark. The acidity of this one is high and more to my wife's tastes - I think I prefer the Duchesse one, but this is still super fantastic"
3632,Ushouldbeworkinh,Rodenbach Grand Cru,3.34,"Nice deep amber brown colour. Smell is vinager, mostly balsamic. Hard to describe smell and flavour.
Very vinegar but in a good way, still a bit much for me. I may need to try more sours"
3633,MikeWard,Rodenbach Grand Cru,4.11,"330ml bottle into a goblet. My best guess at age is bottled September 2020. 

Head vanishes quickly, lightly sour aroma, but the taste is solidly sour with a sweetness in the background. Light body and a drying finish"
3634,TheHammer,Rodenbach Grand Cru,2.42,"Appearance: Poured with a sliver of head that simply couldn't stick around and produced no lace. The body is a opaque cloudy brown, which barely reveals a hint of red when put up to the light, which I suppose is appropriate to style, but doesn't seem very appetizing to me for some reason.

Smell: Oh dear...it's like some kind on unholy mix of wine, apple cider and malt vinegar. I think I am also catching a bit of caramel malt in the background. I will given points certainly of potency, as zero warmup needed for that to be produced. I'll also give it points for complexity, but this is an assault on my olfactory senses. This is a sour at a level that I just can't see liking. 

Taste: Where this beer starts, is where I'd have liked it to end. There is a potent lemon note seemingly barely curbed by some nice notes of cherry and apple, but then the beast is let loose as it passed outright into drinking vinegar with some brown sugar thrown into it, before this odd dry sand skunkness kind of creeps in over the ruins of that experience. There is identifiable complexity here, but the core sour component overshadows it. It's like an Indy band you like, touring with a band that plays with metal nails and a chalkboard.

Mouthfeel: The transitioning here starts high and jumps into orbit, and is then lost to the solar winds, leaving behind acid and sand for us to contemplate. That passes to go back to just a sour lemon note in the aftertaste, which would could be present, if you didn't experience what caused it. Carbonation is also pretty much absent here. There's very little here I enjoy.

Drinkability: Drinkable like a fancy lemonade, made with every bell and whistle, except you used half the water, and no sugar. Way too potent for my liking, and the acidic note I mentioned earlier seems to linger at the top of my stomach after it has gone down. At least the low carbonation doesn't further agitate things down there.

Final Thoughts: I don't think I've ever had a Flanders Red Ale I truly liked, but I also don't recall one ever being this potent. I know there are people who enjoy this, and that this is their jam. There are notes there that tell me, yes this beer is a remarkably complex offering. However for me, they are buried under the sour note of this offering. This is very much not for me, and didn't even make it pass the half way mark. If you relish in sours, this might be for you but this is a hard pass for me."
3635,BrewSmasher69,Rodenbach Grand Cru,3.74,I do not like sours but this is one that got it right. Would not consider it sour but “tangy” in a way. Initially I felt the smell was of a “nail polish” fragrance but learning that it’s made with “Red Wine Vineger” Explains that. Definitely would order another if I’m in the mood for a tangy beer.
3636,JokersAce,Wake-n-Bake Coffee Oatmeal Imperial Stout,4.21,"Big wiff of coffee here, like a very dark and robust roast. Heavily roasted malts here. More roasted dark oats than oatmeal, with some black chocolate and smoked ancho chili pepper in the mix. Thick yet carbonated. 
Very robust stout whose adjuncts are just as strong and bold as the stout character itself. Pretty good."

L: clear, sunbeam-yellow hued liquid; near two-finger high cottony white foam builds on the pour and gracefully recedes into a tight, steady cap... as the sips ebb and flow, some thin, frosty bands of lace stick

S: exquisite blend of diaper funk and fresh flower arrangements, hints of fruity marshmallow and peach skin; white wine and berry notes emerge as the foam falls... I could sniff this for days... by the end, before first sip, a peach yogurt scent takes hold

T: considering the aroma journey, I wasn't expecting quite this dry of a base... following a pithy, floral, vinous first contact, peach yogurt briefly flashes, passing with a tart tail, finishing with the fruity essences panning out to the sides of the palate, ultimately leaving a lightly-crackery aftertaste which gradually gets more mineral and leafy, the center opening up and airing out, exposing a lasting spectre of the funky barrel/woody character... that's just the first, palate-attuning sip... second sip on, its delicate notes of fruity breakfast cereal dancing atop outdoorsy, wet-meadow earthiness and a lightly acidic, lightly nutty-yeasty foreground... dry as a mf... I hesitate to say it slightly reminds me of a gueuze, but, it does

F: what can I say?... it coats and caresses my palate with the sultry mist of a summer fling... soft, rosy warmth stoked at the back of the palate... dry, swift, moist feathery-light; on point, effortless

O: again, I hesitate to say... but I believe I enjoyed this more than any RR bottles I've had over the years, which inevitably is going to now make me go back and try a bunch of them... the hop choices here seem astute, but it's a bit difficult to sort out the origin (hops or bugs) of the subtle nuances... my first Le Terroir; good stuff, and it won't be the last (2154)"

3647,Beginner2,Le Terroir,4.43,"While I've had 73 ales in this style, I understate the situation and say that I am no fan for Wilds. Of the first 200 Wilds listed by their number of ratings, I've had 22 and only 1 did I rate above the average.

Le Terroir is the second.

Since I am such a sour-puss, I should like sour ales. Only rarely is that pairing made.

But this review is supposed to be about Le Terroir. It Looks better than the competition who often look confused and few are foamy. Terroir Smells like tart fruit. And it Tastes that way; yet its sweet and sour combo has this rare drying sensation that continues. Best yet, it does not interfere with my meal of soup and spinach. Too many Wilds overpower. Terroir stays within itself and treats food as a friend. 

I suppose that comes from hiring Rodenbach's brewmaster and the mark he left. 
I've made my micro-review of New Belgium elsewhere and admire the founders who cut their workers into the deal who, in turn, sold the company to a big brand manager. I hope they made the right decision and the creativity of Le Terroir continues.

3652,DrDemento456,B.O.R.I.S. Oatmeal Imperial Stout - Barrel-Aged,3.94,I assume this is the 2010 version because it has a black cap and it's still in a bomber forum. Judging by the glass I got no head whatsoever and a deep dark blackness so I assume it's that old. Smells of obvious whiskey tones some earthy hops and a good bit of charcoal with some chocolate tones. Taste is very balanced smooth no off flavors of wet cardboard or anything just barrel a tiny aspect of whiskey some chocolate and Folgers roast. Body is pretty slick pretty heavy but goes down smooth enough. Overall I only paid $7 for the bottle so I wouldn't consider it a wash but I'm not sure I would go back and get another one even at that price.

Dark fruits,(prune, raisins), toffee, leather, wood, slight oxidization. 
99% flat. No booziness. Smooth. 
Overall: Though definitely old, this ages pretty well. Those melded flavors only age can produce. Ages better than most beers out there. From what I’ve read Lost Abbey was probably flat even when fresh."
3660,DrStiffington,The Angel's Share - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.46,"The Angel’s Share is from 2016. Pours dark, dark brown. Almost black. Very little carbonation during the pour, and then a bit after it was all poured. Immediate aroma of bourbon. I was surprised it was so strong after 4-5 years. Taste follows - big bourbon presence, which makes me happy, because I love bourbon barrel aged beers. Between the color being almost black and the bourbon dominating, this is very close to a bourbon barrel aged stout instead of a barleywine. If given in a blind tasing I might think it was. There’s very little barleywine characteristic: it’s not sweet, don’t get any caramel or toffee. It’s still a bit boozy, but I like that in beers like this."

3.75 4.5 4 4 4.25

Sat on this for 5 years. 
No looker, but smells like a humidor - once you get past the booziness, the complexity of the aroma drips down the back of your throat. 
The taste is dried dark fruit more than any caramel sweetness. And then that bourbon drops in… while among the most harmonious I’ve encountered, it does take over more than complement the base beer. 
Not perfect: it’s flat + boozy - hard to avoid at 12.5%, but it should've mellowed with age. I see lots of good ratings for this, but some are a decade old - maybe this beer jumped out more before everything was getting put in barrels. 
Overall, this has more in common with treacly English strong ales than anything else. But with a lot of bourbon. 

More an advertisement for bourbon barrel aging than a complete beer."
3662,DvdP,The Angel's Share - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.43,"Cork didn't want to get out, no pop. Pours dark brown, flat. Smells bourbon. Smooth mouthfeel, but could do with some carb.

3663,Apellonious,The Angel's Share - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.31,"Vintage 2016. Poured into a tulip glass. No head to speak of, just a full murky ruby brown. Aromas of fig,barrel, and caramel. Taste is similar, no hops semblance at this point. And that is ...Ok. I’ll give you six dollars if you can name where that quote came from. The heft was surprisingly light, carbonation low, mildly sticky as everything warmed. Delicious and coating."

3665,Snowcrash000,Girardin Gueuze 1882 (Black Label),4.36,"Pours a slightly cloudy, deep, dark amber coloration with a small, fizzy head. Smells of slightly doughy, caramelly malt and estery fruits, with notes of red apple, apricot and gooseberry, as well as hints of hay, spice, funk and oak. Taste is a great balance of slightly doughy and caramelly malt and rich notes of estery fruit and lighter spice, with notes of red apple, apricot, gooseberry, clove and peppery spice, as well as some musty funk and slightly tannic oak. Finished with a medium tartness and some estery fruit and spice, as well as musty fubnk and oak lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel with a medium body and carbontion.

While this stands on its own very well, it certainly is by far the best value for money I ever encountered when it comes to Gueuze, although your mileage may vary. I paid 4€ for this 375ml bottle and honestly enjoyed it better than some more established and expensive examples of the style. It's a bit more malt-forward than your average Gueuze, which is not a bad thing at all in my book, while being quite funky, with a certain musty, leathery quality to it. The esters are coming through nicely as well, quite fruity, with hints of spice, while are also some tannic, oaky accents to this. Overall, this makes for a very nice, quite funky and estery Gueuze that feels rich and well-balanced."
3666,MikeWard,Girardin Gueuze 1882 (Black Label),3.85,"375ml bottle into a tulip. 2014 vintage.

Looks okay in the glass. Dull burnt orange body, on the hazy side. Brief bubbly head, but this quickly dies out, no lacing.

No getting anything on the nose, good or bad.

On tasting, all the elements are there, a little funk, sour, faintly tart, some bitterness, underlying fruit. However, the combination is a little bias towards bitter sour.

Mouth between medium and full, finish dry sour bitterness.

Overall, had hoped for better. There was some brownish goo around the cork, so perhaps something was off?"
3667,Sabtos,Girardin Gueuze 1882 (Black Label),4.79,"Displaying beautiful gradients of foggy amber under a dense khaki head that slowly settles to a persistent blanket and unevenly curled collar, I can tell this pour at the renowned Avenue Pub of New Orleans is going to be a wonderful one.

Delicious qualities of toasted sesame seed and oaky funk meet the dichotomously attractive attributes of skunky aged hops. It's just super fluffy, just as the old lady described it, developing a sort of peach-grapefruit note as I dig in. Further on, as it warms, we also detect a touch of pepper and golden raisin.

The full, fluffy yet airy body delicately glides to a semi-dry finish.

I wish I had more time and room in my stomach for a few more of these."
3668,BEERMILER12,Girardin Gueuze 1882 (Black Label),4.34,"A: Pours a golden orange copper color with 2 fingers of head that quickly fades down to a tight, thin cap that has remarkably good retention

S: A good bit of funk and tartness up front along with some fruity notes such as apple, pear, and white grape

T: Follows the nose. Starts off with a mix of funky tart notes, fruit, and wood. A bit of some earthy mineral qualities as well. Finishes with lingering funk, fruit, and earth

M: Medium bodied with moderate, tight carbonation

O: A classic gueuze that lives up to the name. Definitely not the most funky or tart that I’ve had, but it allows for the other qualities to shine a bit. Worth checking out if you’re into the style"

The aroma is nice, pleasant funk, earthy, grassy, lightly floral with a nice berry fruit quality and some pale grain and mineral water. The flavors are nice, lots of earthy funk, grassy, floral, dry dead leaves, mild barnyard qualities, mineral water, cereal grains and a nice bright fruit quality, berries and tart pitted stone fruits. The mouthfeel is good, coating and very lively, crisp medium body that has a nice heft and a tart and dry finish. 

Verdict: A nice Gueuze from Girardin. Lots of nice funk, pleasantly tart and offering a complex spectrum of flavors."
3670,Sigmund,Girardin Gueuze 1882 (Black Label),3.85,"Rerate, 750 ml green ""champagne"" bottle, Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 5%. Deep golden to orange colour, moderate white head. Sourer and even more complex flavour than noted upon first sample. Tart finish, some bitterness. Original rating: At Copenhagen Beer Festival. Hazy golden colour, sparkling. Decent aroma of brettanomyces (sour fruit, farmhouse, horse blanket), but not extreme. The medium sour flavour has also the typical brettanomyces character, but fairly well balanced and not too extreme. Should work well as a beginner’s gueuze."
3671,Victory_Sabre1973,Girardin Gueuze 1882 (Black Label),4.32,"When I popped the cork, there was a nice bit of smoke clinging around the neck of the bottle. It pours a nice apple color. Somewhat clear. 1 1/2 finger slightly off white head. The head retention is poor. The head dissipates to a nice ring around the edge of the glass, that rides up a bit on the edge. No lacing otherwise. There's some carbonation rising in the glass as I watch it. 
The nose is a really wild, and complex funky aroma. There's a bit of apple here, more of an apple cider aroma. There's a farm aroma here - no not cow pies - like a straw/hay aroma. Some floral aromas here as well. 
Taste - Very wild. Up front it seems more into the funky floral that I was getting on the nose. I also get some lemon flavor up front. The apple cider seems to be a back flavor that lingers. 
The body reminds me of champagne - really bubbly, and crisp. Somewhat ""dry"". Crisp feeling. 
I do not have much experience with this style, but I think this is a good representation for this style. I'm enjoying it."

3673,SLeffler27,Fourth Dementia (4D),4.64,"Pours dark walnut with a thin, beige head of fine bubbles. It is quite viscous and black. A syrupy film produces voluptuous legs and lifts spotty lace into patches.

Wow! Rich toffee is accompanied by plums, plum pudding, figs, and molasses. This is quite a treat for my Swiftwater snifter. As it opens up, charred malt, whiskey, and light peat progress across the nose. Dark chocolate gives way to faint oak. All the while, alcohol fumes lend serious gravitas to the aroma.

Up front, it is all about the malt. The charred character leaves mild bitterness. The initial smooth flavors fade, following the nose, although not necessarily in the same progression. The finish is long, chocolate, and has a mild bitter tinge.

The body is full and almost dense. The texture is reminiscent of dense, plush fur, even though syrup clings to the tongue. The alcohol heat is pleasant, as expected, lightly singing the tongue and the throat. Carbonation is soft and fine.

I paired this with an intense and creamy Stilton for an exquisite experience. Both the beer and the cheese came into high definition. The plum pudding sings while the char mellows. The carbonation is no match for the fatty cheese."
3674,beergoot,Fourth Dementia (4D),4.2,"Original blind tasting notes and scores:

3.5 4.0 4.25 4.0 4.0

Definitely a barleywine by taste, roughly 10% ABV

Dark, clear pour, deep mahogany red. Initial decent khaki head, soon fades to thin wisp of cover with a thread of foam circling the inside of the glass

Smell has chocolate notes. Dark roasted malts. No sense of adjuncts or barrel aging.

Chocolate and caramel flavors; mild booziness; brownies; phenol bitterness.

Smooth and silky heaviness to the mouthfeel.

My initial though was a barleywine, but now I'm thinking of a big milk or chocolate stout.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Now that I know what I'm drinking, here are some revised review notes with updates ratings and scores, somewhat affected by how the beer changes as it warms up:

The appearance looks and impressions remain the same: dark, clear pour, opaque look in the glass, very thin and sparse head. The aroma also remains much the same: warm, roasted grain notes with elements of dark chocolate. The taste, as it warms, adds hints of raisins and dates with a bit of chewing tobacco. The mouthfeel expands with some warmth and stickiness on the palate.

Well, I was wrong on about every count of my first impressions. This is a barrel aged beer coming in at 13.5% ABV and is a strong ale. I've read recently where, like is a beer should be considered a porter or a stout, such classifications can also be called into question if a beer is a barleywine or an old ale. I guess it all comes down to what the brewer and the marketing folks want to label a beer. Regardless, this is a fine big beer, very malt forward, with a near magical touch in restraining the relatively high alcohol content with a delicious malt base.

3675,micada,Fourth Dementia (4D),4.25,"I keep thinking this is a barleywine, but it’s really an old ale. That makes more sense because this is a dirty drink. LOL!
It’s a ruddy, murky sort of amber color. Nose is a grape must meets 1970s leather. Flavor is a semi-sweet stone fruit ale, with a real depth of dark flavors. It’s sweaty, in a good way. Mouthfeel is medium, but with a bit of purée to it. No alcohol burn, though there is a bit of a fusel bite near the end.

I had the Let Them Eat Cake version too. I found that one a bit sweeter, reminiscent of having a nice French vanilla cake batter in the brew, though I still don’t know what the actual brewing differences might be."

Old ales are hard to come by and I was anticipating the chance to taste this one. It is well worth waiting for. This one gives me the impression of a quality liquor held for while for proper aging; almost embodying the term ""old ale"". Richer and more complex than any old ale I've had before. The expected dry caramel malt, dried dark fruit and toffee are here, but the finish is a pleasant surprise. There is an unusual smoky or slightly burnt candy taste that is wow inspiring that lingers after the taste with some cellar earthiness. I've really liked the old ales I've tried, but this may be the best one yet. I'd love to see this one again, and I'm psyched to know I have the bourbon barrel aged one in the fridge. Not even sure that treatment is necessary, but I look forward to it. A stellar old ale."
3678,Bouleboubier,Fourth Dementia (4D),4.43,"(12 oz bottle, 2022 vintage, 13.5% abv; purchased single at the brewery last week... poured into a copita-like stemmed glass)

Half-bright, auburn-colored liquid with a tight, gummy foam... dark caramel, old dry furniture wood, kiss of chocolate chip on the nose; not overtly boozy; pleasant expression... dark caramel with great depth on the palate; bold base of parts bready and cakey malt; altogether somehow barely influenced/disturbed by boozy spice or fruitiness but, if (probably) present, sit beautifully in the background; all it now begs for is some barrel funk and/or oxidation to give it hair, give it a weathered unique personality... well, I guess we must chalk it up to the aging that's responsible for the raunch of rotgut having been rolled off to the point of regally rendering this malt nectar not sludgy but satin-soft

what Curmudgeon aspires to be (but they're different enough for each to have a place); possibly the best (American) Old Ale I've tried, but one that sits a step or two away from being legendary; all it's lacking is the 'old', but I loved this, and luckily have a bottle of the BA version waiting in the wings (2192)"
3679,Harrison8,Fourth Dementia (4D),4.19,"Pours a near-black until the last couple ounces, when it turns into a muddy brown with a burgundy-tint. Head is a finger of beige foam. Aroma is raisins, dark fruits, caramel, and toasty, caramely, bready malts. Faint bourbon and barrel come thru as well, but don't do enough to raise the temp of the aroma. It's potent, but balanced. Flavor profile packs a little bit more than the aroma, bringing raisins, dark fruits, caramel, toffee, and chocolate with roasty, caramely, and bready malts underneath. Faint whiskey underneath, which brings a little heat wave, but nothing that disrupts the balance. Mouth feel is medium-thick with a silty texture. Effervescence is soft. Alcohol flattens out the final third. Overall, an easy going 13.5% Old Ale that manages to display whiskey along the way, without being unwieldy. That said, it's still fill and fun. 

Served in a 15.5oz Spiegelau tulip from a 12oz bottle. 2018 version. Consumed/reviewed 10/11/2022."
3680,Coyote42069,Furious,4.37,"On tap from the Surly Brewhouse.

3683,TooManyGlasses,Furious,4.46,"Happy to see this arrive in Alberta!
Pours a crystal clear dark copper/amber with two fingers of creamy off white/tawny head.
Aroma is a wonderful mix of citrus peel, grapefruit, piney resin and a bit of caramel malt with a floral note. As warmed there is just a hint of weedy dankness.
Taste follows with sweet caramel malt - a burst of hop flavours - grapefruit peel, pine resin, some floral flavours and a robust bitterness.
Medium full mouthfeel, bright carbonation and a lingering bright bitterness.
Just a treat."
3684,cjgiant,Furious,4.1,"Clear copper with a foamy head that falls into craters. Nose and taste generically remind me of a hoppy amber ale, with a bit of melanoidin and some metal. That metallic not is something I often get in amber ales, especially with a dose of piney hops, which Furious has a bunch of. It’s evident in the first sip late, and moves forward with each sip. The beer overall is a fairly straightforward American bitter beer with a bit of a malt backbone."

Brewers Notes: A demonic Russian-Style Imperial Stout brewed with coffee, Mexican vanilla, and Indian sugar, this beer defies description. Available one day a year, in April at the brewery: Dark Lord Day.

Vintage guide: Black wax wrapped label = 2020

Bottle received in bif17 courtesy of @ovaltine

Room temperature bottle poured into a pretentious beer glass. Dark cola brown liquid, little foam , settles to a ring 

Aroma is coffee,molasses, brown sugar, tobacco

Taste is coffee, dark fruits, raisins, tobacco, char , port wine

Sudsy mouthfeel, lighter than I expected , boozy 

Good beer, reminds me more of a barley wine than a RIS"
3687,augustgarage,Dark Lord,4.27,"2009 vintage. Poured from a bomber into a snifter. 

Impenetrable seal brown/bistre liquid with a faint almond event horizon. Vague collar, never quite awakens. Thick sheets of legs.

Molasses, port, cherries, cocoa, and char in the nose. More fruit as the ale warms.

Prunes, cherries, and port are forward on the palate. Vinous quality persists with a background of dark malt, black licorice, and faint chocolate. Blackberries, violets, dulce de leche, ash, clay, and figs. Some oxidation is leading this into Old Ale territory, but no cardboard or other off notes. Low bitterness, medium-sweet, linear finish. 

Oily, slick, carbonation has faded though there is some life left.

After 14 years, this has evolved into something difficult to categorize, and in some ways closer to a fortified dessert wine than a RIS."
3688,kitch,Dark Lord,4.36,"A 22 fl. oz. bomber, 2015 vintage, very nicely maroon waxed, poured into a snifter glass.

Taste: Sweet, dark fruit, charred notes, plum, prunes, fig, cherries, brown sugar, molasses, chocolate, coffee, burnt sugar.

Mouthfeel: Full bodied with soft carbonation.

Overall: A nice warming sipper. Maybe approaching too sweet, but the charred and burnt notes do sort of keep it in line."

3692,LiquidAmber,Curieux,4.39,"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a lightly hazy, medium golden amber with a two finger white head with great retention and solid lacing. Aroma of grainy Belgian malt and yeast, clove, lemon and mild bourbon. Flavor follows with grainy Belgian malt and fruity yeast, clove, light bourbon, oak and touch of vanilla. Medium bodied with moderate creaminess. Allagash used to distribute in the Northwest and many of their ales were my introductions to Belgian styles; I didn't realize at the time how authentic most of the were, but I grew to love them. This one I never got to try and was glad to finally get a can of it. Exactly as described, it's a classic Belgian tripel with light bourbon and oaky barrel character. The latter are somewhat subdued, but do add to the interest of this great style. Fine malt and Belgian yeast notes. The oak is mild, and I wish it was a little more assertive. The bourbon is light too, but that seems an appropriate level. Allagash seems quite proud of this one and for good reason. I'd love to drink this again. Nicely done."
3693,Hayesbro,Curieux,4.37,"Pours an opaque gold with a slight head. Strong aromas of sour, surprisingly, and oak, a little aged wine in there. Fairly sweet, the barrel shines through, with some fig notes and spice. Excellent."
3694,FreePal88,Curieux,4.5,"Incredibly sweet, almost sickeningly sweet, but pretty complex. Every swig I'm wrestling with its flavor and sorting through its spicy/oaky/honey/slightly fruity elements.

3697,BWSpoon,Curieux,4.78,"From a can purchased at the brewery. First time and wow. So good!!! Flowery but not perfumy. Light and bright on the palette, like other Allegash beers. Complex, nuanced, a real journey. Not overly boozy in spite of the high ABV. Not an everyday beer. A special event."
3698,jjamadorphd,Curieux,4.1,"Very deceptive, very tasty...

When I see a brew is barrel-aged, at 10.5%, and it has a taste that hints of the booze - I found it very deceptive, in a good way. The booze that I expected to taste and even smell - was basically non-existent. I find this to be well made for that fact alone. A tasty treat indeed that I would be glad to try once again."
3699,Darkmagus82,Curieux,4.34,"Poured from a can into a tulip glass
Appearance – The beer pours a clear golden color with a small white foam. The head has a fantastic level of retention, fading slowly over time and leaving tons of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – The aroma is big and bold with lots of candied sugar and biscuit malt. Mixed with these aromas comes a nice doughy smell mixed with lots of coriander and clove, along with a bit of nutmeg. At the same time notes of yeast and some peach and lychee are there as well. For a bourbon barrel aged brew, the bourbon smell is light, but adds a nice accent, mixing with the rest to produce a rather inviting smell.
Taste – The taste begins with a nice crisp cracker and biscuit malt flavor mixed with some sweet grape, peach, and apricot flavors as well as flavors of candied sugar and yeast cake. Along with these flavors comes a decent showing of coriander and clove, with some lighter notes of white pepper and grain. As the taste advances the sweeter flavors get stronger, with some bubblegum and cane sugar joining in. At the same time a bit of grass and hay join in, and with a touch of bourbon coming on at the end, one is left with a nice, sweet, crisp, and flavorful triple like flavor to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is light for a 10.5 % abv brew, with a carbonation level that is high and effervescent. For the style and the taste, the feel is great and makes for a very pleasant sipper.
Overall – While not very heavy on the bourbon at all, the brew is rather flavorful and tasty. A very nice, slightly sweeter sipper, and one certainly worth a try."
3700,illusionistlynx,Curieux,3.84,"Interesting idea to barrel age a tripel, and the barrel notes are quite nice. However, I find the overall flavor profile lacks many of the qualities I'm looking for from a solid Belgian tripel in addition to being a bit too boozy for the style."
3701,ovaltine,Curieux,4.5,"Pours a gorgeous slightly unfiltered golden color with a creamy white head that yields to the body of the beer fairly quickly. Beautiful tripel. The nose is crammed full of oak notes, with caramel and vanilla in plentiful amounts and a bit of bourbon and pear. I am literally drooling.

That oak flavor is forward and melds well with the caramel and vanilla to provide a smooth foundation for the bourbon to provide a modest amount of booziness, but it’s the pear at the back of the palate that is knocking my beer nerd socks off. So many flavors and so well balanced.

The mouthfeel is substantial and fairly crisp, making for an oxymoron of a beer - a crushable 10.2% ABV beer. This is exceptionally well crafted and a world class tripel that I am so glad I finally had the opportunity to enjoy."
3702,BuxMontBeerLover,Weihenstephaner Vitus,4.15,"Part of a sample pack I received for Christmas. 

Pours a hazy, golden yellow color. Mostly opaque. A one finger head on the initial pour.

Aromas of clove and banana.

Brew that has flavors of a Tripel, with clove, banana, sweet malts. Nice yeasty taste as well. Smooth and easy drinking. The ABV is not noticeable.

Thicker consistency and mild carbonation.

Another brew from the variety pack that falls outside of my regular go-to styles. Very well crafted and actually very delicious…cheers!"
3703,HoppingMadMonk,Weihenstephaner Vitus,4.16,"Orange, amber appearance

3705,Weisenbeer,Weihenstephaner Vitus,4.25,One of the best and oldest breweries in the world and it never disappoints ... I may have an older bottle here and so the appearance is not very thrilling but everything else is an A+
3706,wmeckley44,Weihenstephaner Vitus,4.65,"It's the regular hefe just with more spice, body, and flavor. There's nothing much to say other than that. It's a bigger, more tasty version of the already perfect beer you can find everywhere, with the same heavy banana-clove-spice flavor. Terrible head retention, but otherwise it's a little darker and much more hazy than a standard, plus even more carbonation. I could drink it like water, and it's 7.7%. Lives up to the hype."
3707,Hephaistos,Weihenstephaner Vitus,4.06,"500 ml bottle, 7,7% abv. opens smokey, signs of yeasting on the bottle.
Poured in a proper Weihenstephaner glass. Hazey yellow colour, a bit more white than golden. Highly carbonated, small bulbs. Very vivid beer. But only a two finger white head of dense cream.
No signs of yeast.
Smells like a freshly baked butter cake.
Butter, cream, hints of vanilla.
Mouthfeel, maybe a lesser point of this beer, But at the end it is about taste.
A cross over in between a Weissen and a strong pale ale. Very enjoyable bocked weissen. Moderately biscuity, fruity an dyeasty. Balanced taste with only little bready aftertaste,
No infusions, just top quality ingredients and patience.
Really well done. I would have liked a bit mor punch to be honest. But no serious complaints.
Selling this in 500ml bottles is a bit dangerous though."
3708,greenjeff4141,Weihenstephaner Vitus,4.41,"Bought in a bottled six pack at ABC in Central Florida. 

Pours a hazy golden color with very little head which dissipated very quickly. No lacing. If you didn't know it was a beer, you might mistake it for juice or Tang by just looking at it. Smells yeasty and citrusy. There's also bananas and a bit of clove. Hints of candied ginger or something similar. Some spice, but not sure what. Reminds me of a witbier in look and smell. Mildly bitter and tastes very much like it smells. Pretty effervescent. Alcohol is almost non existent in taste, but high in amount. At 7.7% it lures you in waiting to mug you when you least suspect it. 

This is the 3rd beer from Weihenstephan I've had in about as many days. This brewery knows damn well how to make a good beer. It's not flashy and you'd walk right by it on the shelf if you didn't know any better. It's another fantastic beer from a fantastic brewery."
3709,Sigmund,Saison-Brett,3.77,"750 ml bottle, vintage 2013, probably from Vinmonopolet. ABV is 8.5%. Pale golden colour, only slightly hazy. Huge and lasting white head. Lovely aroma of saison yeast and brett, with fruity and peppery notes, hints of farmhouse. Medium sweet but still quite crisp flavour with peppery notes, distinct bittering hops."
3710,entheos,Saison-Brett,4.01,"An acidic, but fruitful saison. Has a very relaxed aftertaste that is warm and fresh. The energy aroma is better than it’s taste, but still an excellent beer."
3711,johannyne,Saison-Brett,4.31,"Appearance: Pours a hazy yellow-orange, thick, fluffy head, great retention. Inviting indeed, would love it if the head was not just plain white. Lacing is quite good, nothing crazy though.
Smell: Hop backbone, citrusy, namely orange and grapefruit. Notes of brett and pepper.
Taste: Balanced. The citrusy hops mingle well with the brett notes. Hop bitterness is low. Brett, peppery and citrusy hops are at the top. The finish has a nice malty tinge and tastes of alcohol. As it gets warmer, the pepper notes really come through, like Tank 7.
Mouthfeel: Effervescent burn, light bodied, soft, crisp, refreshing, smooth enough, dry. It touches the lips and tongue with a gentle caress.
Overall: First off...it's not Tank 7...and that's to be expected! It's a lovely beast of its own and it's well invited. I have another already to drink down the road, in a few years...but I may get another for my birthday next year. So good!"
3712,rodbeermunch,Saison-Brett,3.89,"Had a 2011 bottle back in September 2015. Bottle # 12235. 

Pours a darker golden color, hints of mild cloudiness and with a big ol' full on head exceeding 1"". Aroma imparted notes of grain, alcohol, hay, rawhide, pepper and bitter melon. 

Taste allayed my fears about this being too big and an ""imperial"" saison. 8.5% is too big normally, but somehow this kept its style guideline roots. Mouth feel stayed relatively dry and light instead of dropping an oppressive amount of alcohol. More lemon tartness in the taste than aroma. A little bit of other citrus beyond that, a pear note and a pineapple note. Minimal band aid phenol funk notes. Even though it was 4 years old, it didn't seem much different than fresher pours I've had of it. 

At the end of the day its a very good beer, but the price point (around $20) is such that I dunno how often I can buy a bottle of it. A pour on tap, sure, knock it out every time. But a bottle, that is sometimes tough because you can get other ones for half the price."
3713,CraigDeMoss,Saison-Brett,4.38,"2018 on tap. Into tulip

Original rating from notes pulled from Inter-dimensional memorial travel through millions of miles of space and time away: 4.25 across the board 

Oh lawd this takes me back. Wish I could get this in a 2008. 

Slight amber haze with one-finger tight, ivory, sticky foam head. 

Upfront barnyard funk, sweet n’ sour lemon citrus. Slight caramel and multigrain bread coming through. Fresh scythed meadow outside of Stull, Ks. Lovely

Not the same as I remembered but pretty close. Great big funky citrus lemon peel and orange pith. Brett comes
swinging through with the proto-funk like Herbie Hancock on a headhunt. Piss-soaked horse blanket that I chewed on in a dream. Splendid. 

A bit tame on draft compared to the errant eruption of yesteryear. Still fizzy and bubbly, champagney(?). Slight drying with a balanced malt sweetness. 

An OG in my book. just a young buck, but man was this a trip when I first had it. Several times since and I stick with my ratings. You know what? Bump that taste and feel up a notch. Worth a shot."

There is a lot more going on with taste than I can describe. Outstanding mouthfeel, heavier carbonation, but not unpleasant. Overall world-class."

Tastes pretty nice, clean honeydew melon, green banana plantain notes, tart lemon, mild apple, peppercorn clove spice, some funky earthy Brett notes like sweet leather, rubber tire, dried fruit, apricot, caramel, vanilla, bready malts, with floral herbal hops. Feels medium lighter bodied, creamy smooth with moderate carbonation. Overall a nice aged Brett saison."
3716,ChrisCage,Velvet Merkin,4.39,"Picked this up from the fridge at Aces and Ales Tanaya Las Vegas! Great Selection of vintage btw!

A- Pours a very dark brown, almost black color, and shows off not a head, but rather a decent looking caramel colored ring of foam around the inside of the tulip that I am using. I can see a select few columns of carbonation rising to the top of the brew and the lacing starts out well, but then I watch it fizzle off so not sure what to think about that. Overall I find this to be an above average stout!

S- Oh right away I smell boozy charred bourbon barrel, of which this was aged in! Alongside whisky, rum, wood char and smooth alcohol, I find there to be aromas of rich dark chocolate, black French Press coffee, dry flaked oat, vanilla bean, blackstrap molasses and nuances of spicy root beer/cola on the finish. Muted hop presence as well.....overall it has a medley of aromas, and seems fairly smooth on the nostrils.

T- The flavors follow the nose fairly closely! Beautiful cola/root beer sweetness (sarsaparilla, licorice, cinnamon, slight citrus), dark chocolate, cocoa, creamy unsweetened coffee, fresh vanilla bean, and oh did I mention the bourbon barrel char? There is an oat flake dryness about it, but the aging has smoothed this out. I also detect some dried dark fruits such as prune/fig/raisin and the pits that would accompany these fruits too to add some bitterness/dryness. The finish has some astringent character and the woodiness lingers onto the next taste

M/O- Well it is pretty velvety I have to say, although the carbonation still has a bit of zing to it. The mouthfeel is medium fullness, and overall it is quite drinkable! I enjoyed this over the course of 90 minutes and it didn't disappoint....in fact I would pay the $35 USD again to just pour and have this again! A nice Oatmeal Stout and I'm willing to bet it gets better even over the next couple of years."
3717,Herbabee,Velvet Merkin,4.68,"i'm here with an cellared 2018 version (and with a '17 remaining - so as to equalize my FW vintage cask o' 24 preciously-boxed vessels) and am so noting...

Uneventfully unpried into 6 fl oz snifter, the pour issues a reliably mostly-opaque body with most resilient tan-color pinky-finger capper, inevitably reducing to a misty film on surface flanked by gauntlet of micro-bubbly tan ring. I'm always looking for that ""fiddle-faddle"" nuance in the nose and taste, and methinks it's still got it. Nice, grainy, woodsy, nuanced bittersweet from palate to swallow, but not at all overbearingly. Always enjoyed this within their repertoire, and i'd be overjoyed if they offered a new batch of the ol' recipe."

Dark brown/ruby with excellent clarity; two fingers of creamy khaki head with a few rocks; ok to good cap retention; solid plus ring; sudsy lace; medium legs on swirl. Nose is decidedly bourbon with nuanced chocolate right behind. Taste follows nose; oaky vanilla middle; no coffee or much of anything else; bourbon balls finish. Medium minus body, light carbonation; light silky feel; no warmth from 8.5%; dry barrel finish.

3721,Roy_Hobbs,Velvet Merkin,3.94,"2017 Vintage. Cola colored on the pour with a thin beige head. Decent legs. Aroma is rich, with some nice vanilla notes still present. Taste is chocolate and some vanilla. Feel is surprisingly thin. Good, but not great beer. Distinctly possible the age didn't help."
3722,40ontarget,Velvet Merkin,4.55,"Dark cola colored with a 1/4 inch tan head. There are fresh biscuits, mocha ice cream, pecan Sandies, vanilla, and bread pudding with bourbon sauce on the nose. The taste is pecan pie, dark corn syrup, bittersweet chocolate, cafe au lait, cherry cola, and bourbon lingering constantly in the background. Vanilla, oak, and a bare hint of char are on the finish. The nose here is magnificent. It is a great opening like the introduction to the Scarlet Letter. Everything about the nose makes the anticipation of drinking almost unbearable. The actual drinking of this beer slows the grandiose of the nose to a slow afternoon on a porch watching the sunlight filter through the trees. Very calming and satisfying, a bit hot but relaxing nonetheless. Sweet but not cloying. Rich but not heavy. This is as good as an oatmeal stout gets. ( Found old notes on this one)"

Name: Red Poppy
Brewery: The Lost Abbey
Location: San Marcos
Style: Barrel-Aged Wild Ale
ABV: 6.5%
Date: 
I have searched for this beer for quite a while; I stumbled upon it about two years ago. Climbing to 1900 reviews should be something special to drink. I have been wanting to drink this and Cable Car. Using a tulip glass, I served the beer at around 48 degrees. The pour created an off-white frothy one-fingered head with poor retention. The quick dissipation left no lacing on the glass. Looking at the murky color in the cup, I would chart it around SRM 26, dark rusty brown. The appearance is about average for this style. 
Nosing the glass, I smell barnyard, cherries, horse blankets, fruity sweetness, acidic acid, wine, oak, and a fruity tartness. 
I taste tart jammy cherries, barnyard funk, straw, oak, acidic acid, winey, slight fruity sweetness, herbal, lightly floral, and yeasty. 
The mouthfeel is puckering and tart, finishing dry. The body is medium with a medium-plus carbonation. 
This is a fantastic beer! The cherries are bright, vibrant, and tart, with a wild yeasty flair. This could be too much pucker power for some people, but I find it delightful. I would love a few more bottles of this and let it age for several years to see if the pucker power is tamed. Overall, great beer; glad I got to consume it."
3729,WickedBeer,Red Poppy Ale,4.02,"2013 vintage.

The nose is fantastic; oak & jammy cherry; puckering. The palate hits with sour cherry, medium tannin, and dry oak. Carbonation is completely gone, which is a shame. Without it, that acid comes on a little too strong. Opened to honor our daughter, Poppy!"
3730,jngls,Red Poppy Ale,4.26,"2022 vintage. Can to wine glass.

L: Pours a minimally reddish muddy brown with a foamy beige head that leaves plenty of lacing. Lots of fine floaters.

S: Ripe sour cherries and poppy seeds. Yeasty, funky and slightly vinegary.

T: The sweeter notes are less present than in the smell, but they are definitely there in a fresher form. Tart, yeasty and very earthy. Hints of fruity red wine.

F: Quite soft and smooth despite its strong carbonation.

O: Very good American take on a classic Belgian style. Fresh and fruity with the barrel coming through really nicely. Great balance. Subtle complexity. Already looking forward to try some older vintages."
3731,thebeers,Red Poppy Ale,4.18,"Red Poppy pours a vibrant ruddy brown color with a massive tan head that dissipates quickly and unevenly, producing a short-lived rocky effect that’s quite pretty while it lasts before leaving a film-like cap, a thick crown and some spotty strands of lacing.

It has a nice aroma of vinegar and cherry with both leather and some slightly creamy notes behind.

That great vinegary Flanders quality continues to the taste, with the edges nicely rounded by the fruit and perhaps by age. There’s a definite red wine element to it also, which provides some depth I enjoy. The taste closes with a fairly tart, drying finish that lets just a little of the cherry juice linger.

The feel’s medium bodied and soft with soft carbonation.

This is a really well-made beer. The cherry doesn’t pop as much as, say, Alexander, but it’s a pleasant undercurrent throughout and counteracts the acidity. Can’t really say what the poppy seeds added, but they certainly don’t detract from the beer in any way. 

I couldn’t find a clear bottling date anywhere on here, but there’s a raised, unobtrusive “19” on the glass, making me think that’s when the bottle and/or beer was made."
3732,AzfromOz,Red Poppy Ale,2.73,"Purchased in November 2021 from HopHeads in Altona, on the outer western edge of Melbourne, in Australia. Drunk in July 2022.

Pours a bright burgundy colour. There's no evident carbonation and no head. 

The nose is strongly sour cherry and balsamic vinegar. There are hints of vanilla. The aroma already has my mouth watering, but it's already presenting as something that's going to be overwhelmingly sour and acidic. I'm not sure I'm looking forward to it...

The taste, oh my, the taste. It's bracing. It's like the first time I had a Warhead lolly, with an immediate reaction of ""wow, that's sour"". In fact, it's extremely sour, like a mouthful of sour (Morello) cherries. There's also a sharp, dry kick at the end. As it warms it mellows slightly but develops tannic notes and grape or cherry skin highlights, to the point it begins to resemble a red wine, but with a residual vinegar aftertaste.

The mouthfeel is sharp, and it's almost stinging on the way down. Not terribly enjoyable for mine.

Overall this is too sour and then too much like I'm drinking a glass of red wine. I've read a number of reviews and none seem to mirror the harshness of my experience with the beer, which was not an enjoyable one. Maybe I had a bad bottle or it had been treated poorly before reaching me? Not sure, but I can only go on my evidence.

Cheers!"

Skinny can served in a little glass. 

Pours dark purple-red. Small head, lots of carbonation. Smell is moderate wood, a little cherry skin.

Taste is tart, cherry, tannic. Some fruit skin bitterness.

Mouthfeel is light. Overall, pretty good."
3734,elNopalero,Red Poppy Ale,4.43,"Pours a ruddy amber auburn. Light aroma, with a faint cherry tinge. Lightly tart, sharply effervescent, completely delicious. 
Tried this with at least a year and change on it, possibly a lot longer. Held up well."
3735,Whyteboar,Red Poppy Ale,4.6,"Not able to try Lost Abbey often, but this was gifted me in a recent Can-Cans BIF so I got to try it.
Mixed reaction, glad to be drinking it, bummed I can't go to the store and buy any around here.
But that's not a review-
Poured from 12 oz ""stovepipe"" can into a stemless teku glass. Color brown, like a strongly brewed iced tea, but the tan head that quickly builds and faded to mere lacing assures me this isn't tea.
The aroma is definitely cherry forward, but backed by malts of unknown origin. Unexpected but very pleasant.
Taste leaves everything I experienced with this beer in the rear view. Tart cherries strongly edge a malty base and combine in a way I've never experienced in a sour before. Really something. And really good!
Feel is tingly, but not from carbonation. crisp and smooth, how that's simultaneously done I may never know.
Good beer. Bummed its only 12 oz now."
3736,tdm168,Doppelbock Dunkel,4.02,"Pours a dark ruby amber with a soft cap of off white, brownish head that lingers on. The nose is bread with hints of caramel syrup. The taste is similar; dark bread, caramelized sugar, some toffee, a hint of dark fruit. The mouthfeel is full but crisp."

Appearance: Clear dark copper-amber color, with a very thin off-white head that eventually died away. Some small strands of lacing that dissipated quickly. Great color. 

Smell: Malty, herbal, a little bit smoky, and a hint of licorice. 

Taste: Toasted malt, noble hops, licorice, grapes. There is a lot going on here. 

Mouthfeel: Good thickness, a little sticky on the teeth, prickly carbonation, and a bit of a dry finish . 

Overall / Drinkability: A very different doppelbock - a lot richer in flavor and quite enjoyable. I could see myself having a second one over a long meal. Dangerously drinkable."
3738,jjamadorphd,Doppelbock Dunkel,4.51,"Quite possibly the best doppelbock I have ever had, and it might be the best beer I have had to date...

What an experience - beautiful dark caramel coloration with frothy head, a malty scent to the nose that translates to an even maltier taste on the tongue. Mouthfeel is the best ever, again, possibly - it was thick, rich, creamy, and full-bodied. I cannot remember the last time I was so impressed. Overall, it is one of the best in it's category if not *the* best. I will definitely be on the lookout for this again with the holidays approaching."
3739,AGU313,Doppelbock Dunkel,4.08,"A: Dark caramel, medium head, clear

Aromas promising dark fruits, rum and caramel. Maltier and less sweet taste than nose would suggest with teast and bready finish. It's complex and full of character.

3743,defunksta,Doppelbock Dunkel,4.29,"Appearance: Pours a clear, dark amber to deep brown color with a moderate light tan head. SRM of 18-20. (4.00)

Aroma: Strong aromas of brown bread, caramel, some hints of dark fruit of raisin, plum, grape. (4.25) 

Flavor: Strong flavors of caramel, brown bread, some hints of dark fruit with some dark grains, yeasty, and bready off the end. (4.25) 

Feel: Medium-bodied, strong carbonation. Toasted, mildly sweet finish. (4.25) 

Compared to Weihenstephaner Korbinian 3/15/2023: Pours lighter, similar head. Stronger aromas. More brown bread, toasted grains. Less dark fruit and syrup. Less cocoa. Slightly more carbonation and yeastier.

Overall: An excellent doppelbock here as expected. Complex Strong and bready flavors that lean a bit toasted. Nice German yeast give a clean and dry finish. That is what makes this better than every other doppelbock I've tried. Side-by-side this is the best. (Rating: 4.29)"
3744,StJamesGate,Doppelbock Dunkel,4.24,"Cherry brown with a steady, puffy tan cap of froth; fresh baked bread, red currants, pretzels and Raisinettes; dark bread crust, red plums, brown sugar, carob bark and a vague herbal ending; fizzy, medium, dead smooth. 

4 4.25 4.25 4.25 4.25 

All the right moves. 
Lest it be taken for granted, it is burn-free, attenuated, silky - all of the things you’d expect from German precision brewing. If I’m forced to find fault, it’s a bit undercarbed which makes it play a touch sweeter than it should. 
Also surprised and delighted by all the fruit - I can’t help thinking that this brings many of the notes that make Baltic Porter great but in a much more drinkable package. That makes this even less bready and more estery than Korbinian; I’d love to drink the two side by side. 
Very digestif; it just slides right down, but I’ll love to pair it with duck or pork chops. 

Proper wintery treat; deserves many revisits."
3745,Rnormoyle,Doppelbock Dunkel,4.67,I have been to the monastery in Kloster twice and had this beer fresh from the tap. It has a deep amber color and flavorful aroma. It’s is powerful tasting but not so much as some other German DoppelBachs. Definitely tastes of caramel and very smooth. Almost as good out of the bottle but I can’t think of any beer that is as good out of a bottle than fresh from the tap. This is probably my #1 Doppelbach
3746,SHODriver,Bravo,4.5,"A: Poured into a snifter to a deep brown beer that's slightly amber around the edges. THe beer is topped by a dense and slightly rocky finger and a half of off white head which fades slowly to a collar around the edge of the glass with minimal lacing
S: Smells of caramel and brown sugar with some hints of barrel and faded oily hops.
T: Taste is caramel, some oak and woodspice, hints of citrus and pine from the hops, a touch of vanilla and some brown sugar sweetness. On the finish there's more oily citrus and pine with some lingering oak, caramel, and brown sugar.
M: This beer has a body which is on the heavier side of medium. Carbonation is slightly effervescent and adequate for the style while the beer has a drying finish due to the ABV.
O: Overall this is a really good beer. Great flavors and decent complexity that also stands up well to some age."
3747,DaveMaciolek21,Bravo,4.83,"Consumed in 2023. Quite a revelation in a field of mild brown ales. Nothing mild here. Brown liquid with a sturdy, beige head. Oak and bourbon come through in delightful waves, but never too much. Bourbon strength is balanced with a fig and chocolate sweetness, creating a beer that evolves throughout the taste, leaving a deep, luxurious finish. Work of art here."
3748,Sludgeman,Bravo,4.63,"More barrel aged barley wine than brown ale, but regardless of how you classify this beer, it’s is a tasty beer. Very well done, with the barrel aging moderated but strong. A beautiful clear amber brown. Warming, smooth and a hint of sweetness."

Taste of of dark bread, prunes, chocolate, figs, fudge, vanilla. Some winey taste in there too. Definitely evolved as it warmed. Got better and better [or that could be the alcohol talking]

Mouthfeel was somewhat heavy on the tongue

Overall, very nice especially given its age. Held up well over the years. The beer reminded me of a warm blanket sitting in front of a fire. Nice."

Dark chocolate slaps you in the mouth on the first sip; coffee hits you on the back end. 

This feels and tastes like a delicious chocolate malt. One of a kind."

Fuck it. Let’s dive in like Phelps and do the damn thing…

Ok, I’ll be quick: smells and tastes like chemicals. This can’t be its true taste. Take this review with a grain of salt. I’m thinking somewhere along the line something is wrong. But if it isn’t… Either way, sucks for the Raul man right now."

Here we go, beer number 666. And a 101oz bottle at that. I paid over $100 for this but I think it’s gonna be worth it splitting this thing with my boy. Let’s unlock the mini padlock and pop this baby open!

Pours murky reddish brown with 2 fingers of tan head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing

This has definitely lost its' intense hoppiness over time, but this honestly smells great now, like a lightly hoppy barleywine. I'm picking up on aromas of sweet brown sugar, molasses, toasted pecan, earthy hops, caramel, golden raisin, and light toast

Where it was charmingly old in aroma, this is a bit too old and faded in taste. It's not necessarily bad but it's showing significant age. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting earthy hops, fusel alcohol, caramel malt, and light fig. The swallow brings notes of brown sugar, toasted pecan, brown bread, and nutty malt

A medium full body pairs with very mild carbonation, resulting in a smooth yet slightly hot beer. Finishes mostly dry with a mild earthy bitterness

It's not the best beer in the world, but I'm still happy to have gotten this big bottle. I'll have to see how I feel after finishing the big ass bottle"

There’s plenty of hops in this one (surprise, surprise), but this is probably not where you go when you look for balance."

Finish sees some black coffee, a bit of char, and some lingering dark fruit. Aftertaste has a bit of molasses in it. Alcohol is pretty well hidden to me. Feel is full bodied, light, tight carbonation. Overall, this is great. It's a well balanced beer with a lot of great flavors. Awesome."
3764,SpaceCamp,Expedition Stout,4.39,"L: Pours a dark, rich chocolate that forms a thin walnut head, which is quick to dissipate, leaving behind a spotty retention on top and a thin ring of lacing around the edge of the snifter. Held to the light, this beer has a 

S: Classic RIS aromas of roasted/charred malt, baker's chocolate, coffee roast, burnt sugar, and molasses. A faint whiff of dark fruit.

T: Follows the nose. Big roasted malt, coffee, and baker's chocolate at the front, followed by some alcohol heat, hops, and smokiness. There is a slight lactose sweetness, dark fruit, and burnt brown sugar that somewhat contrasts with the bitterness at the outset. Maybe some slight molasses as well in the finish. However, this beer is driven by the bitter character that is typical of a good Russian. Full marks - easily one of the best RIS from a flavor perspective. 

F: Rich, silky, almost velvety and a bit chewy mouthfeel. Full-bodied. Some very light carbonation. 

O: This is a fantastic Russian Imperial Stout with no weaknesses. The flavor is top-notch. The body is perhaps the weakest spot but that's nitpicking. Full marks and worth a purchase for any stout lover."

Aroma is mild, of burnt coffee, molasses, licorice, cassis.
Flavours of dark roasted coffee dominate, bitter and pungent in the finish, almost smokey; some balance is provided by fondant sweetness, a touch of lactose - this is coming together to bring to mind a campfire with marshmallows; the feel is like a soft blanket, with fine, mellow carbonation, and a full body, though there is some stickiness; over time the flavours balance out even more, the bitterness less aggressive.

Bold flavour and a caressing feel, it holds nothing back and demands to be sipped on a cold winter day. Delicious and single-minded."

The pour yields a thin line of dark brown foam. It quickly fades, leaving a ring around the glass. 

Nose is right down the middle Russian Imperial material. Roasted malt brings notes of dark chocolate, dark fruits, brown sugar, and the slightest bit of soy sauce. You can tell that this brew will be incredibly animated just from a first glance. 

Taste follows through, but bringing even more. Roasted malt, smokiness, dark chocolate, dark fruit, slight caramel, brown sugar or perhaps even black strap molasses. Wonderful stuff. The bitterness on this one is just perfect. Reaching high points, but never overwhelming or obtrusive. The flavors still fly true, almost urged onward by the bitterness, them working in tandem. Everything working together to create the final product.

Mouthfeel is fullbodied, almost pillowy. Has heft and density to it with just the slightest bit of cloying. Very mild carbonation. The mouthfeel delivers the flavor perfectly. 

Overall this is easily one of the best Russian Imperials you can buy. In eternal cellared stout, beer fridge, staple material along the likes of Sierra Nevada's Barrel Aged Narwhal, Old Rasputin, and Founders Imperial Stout. A brew that demands respect."

3769,mpruden,Expedition Stout,4.75,"Poured from a 12-oz bottle, dated 9/7/22, ""Shelf Life — Unlimited,"" and purchased at the brewery last month, into a stout glass.

Appearance: Opaque/black, with a massive dark tan head that lingered a very long time and left beautiful lacing.

Nose: Very complex: dark roast, a bit of coffee, sweet dried fruit, brown sugar -- oh, my!

Mouthfeel: Thick and creamy.

Attack: Bitter, as you would expect from an RIS — but absolutely well-balanced and very smooth — deep dark roast, chocolate, dark fruit sweetness, a little coffee.

Finish: The bitterness from the dark roast as well as from some hops lingers, and lingers very nicely.

Overall: There's a lot going on in this fantastic RIS; few beers are this well balanced. Certainly not a session beer at 10.5% ABV, but more drinkable than just a sipper. I'm having a hard time coming up with anything I don't like about this beer. I understand that my rating numbers are very high for this beer — and higher than the average of other raters; I truly think it's worth these scores."

The flavour has also loads of chocolate and cocoa, but the sweetness is not too extreme. Also some roasted coffee notes. A moderate hoppy bitterness in the finish (Chinook and Willamette) balances some of the chocolate sweetness. Very drinkable for an 11% beer. I had no problem finishing the bottle - but if you hate chocolate, this is clearly not a beer for you."

Really hits the spot. I guess it could be a dessert beer but when its freezing outside and the snow is blowing it'll do. Looks like motor oil with very little head. Just like an imperial stout should. With my diminished sense of smell I get chocolate (imagine that) and malt. Can't decide if its milk chocolate, bittersweet or what but definitely chocolate. Taste is the star here. Chocolate of course but I don't think its too sweet. Nice clean finish I could drink it for dessert but it's fine in front of the fire in the dead of winter. Mouthfeel is almost perfect. Slightly thick, smooth as silk and just about right. Overall, a really good imperial stout.

Black colored body, with ruby back lit highlights. Two fingers of tan head settles back to bubbly cap. Leaves very little lacing.
Aroma is similar to a chocolate malt. Smells very sweet.
Taste is sweet but also bittersweet, and with a little smoky char. Displays many types of chocolate, from sweet milk chocolate to bitter dark chocolate. Roasted malts are there for support.
Mouth feel is about medium, but the texture is more rich and with slight syrup. Good carbonation.
This is a beer made to display many forms and textures of chocolate, fudge to syrup to milk chocolate balls to bittersweet. Ultimately sweet and best suited for a dessert experience."
3775,Tom-o-Bedlam,IPA,4.5,"Piney hops. Bitter with a bit of citrus and some sweet malt. Smooth and crisp. Very drinkable—you may want to slow yourself down.

3777,mooseisloose,IPA,4,Served up in a pint. Sparky and sting notes of pine and grapefruit. Taste is chewy and strongly fresh and bitter with a thick middle and a heavy bitter finish. Very good.
3778,JZH1000,IPA,3.8,"Poured from a 12oz can

On the pour, 3 fingers of white, well supported head were present that forms nice damage. Body is a deep deep gold with super fine carbonation rising up.

Aroma is super bright and happy with an overhanging darkness. Bright, floral, fruity, and dank, with a sweet malt. Not the most balanced.

Flavor is more balanced than the aroma, and the malt comes off as less sweet. There is a piney and slightly citrus hop note up front that slowly builds in bitterness and darkness. Solid slightly sweet, and bread malt backbone. Some herbal hops are present as well I realized.

Feel is very full, and verging on heavy. The malt is mouthcoating and the hops are too. Not overwhelming but very full with a slight hint of alcohol.

Overall this is pretty good, but I'd argue not quite world class. Could be crispier and the hops could have a more focused flavor. Probably best to go into this expecting an imperial English IPA, because this has some English hop vibes as well."

Pours a slightly chill hazed bright golden with two plus fingers of foamy white head. Clear golden as warms.
Nose of citrus, mango and bit of bready malt - as warms bursts with the mango and over ripe orange; piney with floral notes.
Tastes initially of sweet bready malt, tropical fruit and ripe orange. Piney and herbal bitterness follow with hints of grapefruit and resin at the back of the palate.
Medium mouthfeel, nicely carbonated with a smooth drying bitter finish."

Clear, pale gold colored body. One thick finger of white head, and this turns into a thin cap and high ring. Leaves behind some wide rings of lacing.
Aroma of citrus and pine. Pine, grapefruit, and resin bitterness.
Taste follows the nose, with orange, grapefruit, and pineapple joined by pine resin bitterness. A little sweet but with a bitter tail end. Very good toasted malt base.
Medium mouth feel, with a touch of nectar. Clean and drying finish. Some tongue numbing. Excellent carbonation.
Classic West Coast IPA, with enough juice to be thirst quenching."
3781,elNopalero,IPA,4.28,"From a stovepipe, as mother nature intended. Pours like a classic WCIPA, with a generous cap of foam on top. Light aroma, with a touch of pine and a little floral note. The malt doesn’t assert itself, leaving it crisp on the finish."
3782,The_Kriek_Freak,Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Stout,4.56,"This beer pours black but with a definite brown hue about it. The aroma is very pleasant with hints of bourbon, wood, and the unmistakable sweetness of an imperial stout. The flavor is not overpowering and it is extremely balanced between a mellow sweetness and a lingering but subtle bitterness. The mouthfeel is smooth, but more carbonated than I was expecting. This is a great barrel aged imperial stout and I would definitely seek it again."
3783,Braunmeister_1943,Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Stout,4.21,"Purchased as part of a 4 pack from Goshen Beverage in West Chester, PA on 6/29/23. 

L- Pitch black with a very delicate head.

S- BBA notes very forward: vanilla, 
caramel. 

T- Beautiful bourbon but not over-
powering. Some “boozy “ heat 
very delicate stout flavors on
the back end.

F- Rather light mouthfeel. Very delicate 
carbonation.

O- A great BA imperial stout!"
3784,Brenden,Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Stout,4.26,"L: Dark brown with some light sneaking through the edges, very thick; slight tan head with some lacing
S: Barrel, including some oak, caramel, and vanilla notes, with a touch of barley, chocolate, and vague dark berry
T: Fudgy up front, not just chocolate but thick fudge, with nice drying from woody notes and no letup from some sweet vanilla, toffee, and caramel notes all the way through; a bit of those dark fruits linger throughout
F: Not as thick as it looks, more of a medium body; it would be better if it didn't thin out a touch as it went, but pretty good from front to back"
3785,tradershmulie,Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Stout,4.32,"Nice deep color, but not pitch black. Head dissipated quickly. Noticeable carbonation.

Good smell. A bit sweet. Very pleasant.

Very tasty. Smooth, a bit of sweetness, but not too much. I like the carbonation.

Overall a very good stout."
3786,defunksta,Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Stout,3.77,"Appearance: Pours a completely dark black color with a strong dark tan head. SRM of 23-24. (4.00)

Aroma: Strong aromas of bourbon with hints of coffee upfront. This mixes into a chocolate, sweet caramel, and bread pudding aromas. Aromas are rich and sweet. (3.75) 

Flavor: Strong flavors of bourbon again upfront. There's a strong bourbon and boozy bite in the middle before it melds into a warm caramel, maple syrup, and bread pudding flavors that lingers at the end. Sweet. (3.75) 

Feel: Heavier bodied, mild carbonation. Strong and sweet with a booze and bourbon bite. (3.75) 

Overall: Heavy on the bourbon here and I'm sure a great Stout. A little too much bourbon and booze flavor for my taste, but still has some nice warm and rich flavors off the end. Caramel, maple syrup, bread pudding. Sort of reminds me of an imperial Backwoods Bastard. The heavy bourbon isn't my forte, but okay. (Rating: 3.77)"
3787,Blogjackets,Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Stout,4.31,"Poured from a twelve ounce bottle, the body is a deep brown or black. One finger of a light tan head and good lacing.

Aroma is the barrel, vanilla, chocolate and dark fruit (a bit of cherries).

Taste follows nose with an assertive bourbon flavor and some oak, chocolate, dark fruit, and malty char. At the end of swallow, a light bitterness appears. As the stout warms, everything softens. Wonderful.

Creamy mouthfeel with good carbonation. Not the thickest stout feel, but flavor more than makes up for it.

A top notch barrel aged stout."
3788,Viaduck,Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Stout,4.14,"A nice tan head sits atop a dark body. Very pleasant aroma: bourbon, the sweet scent of fermented malt, vanilla, brown sugar & implied happiness. Only the slightest bit sweet with a touch of saltiness. Flavor is everything promised by the aroma with some complex barrel flavors. As thick as expected but a bit thin on carbonation. An excellent stout."
3789,lwillitz,Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Stout,4.71,"12-oz bottle into Samuel Smith pint glass
Vintage 2019

A - 3 fingers of deep tan over a pitch black body with orange/ruby highlights

S - sweet malts, a little milky, a touch of metallic, some chocolate, wood and other delightful complexities of bourbon; marvelous!

T - sweet malt and chocolate, alcohol warmth in the back, wood/bourbon/vanilla in the finish; complex and delightful!

M - smooth oily medium/full body, low carbonation

O - just excellent"
3790,highdesertdrinker,Fantôme Saison,4.25,"Pours gold with an average amount of head. Smells musty and funky and strong and you know this is gonna be bold for the style. The taste is sour, dry, and a little bitter at first and then it opens up and you can taste lemon, must, a little grassy, but a prominent, distinctive flavor profile. As saisons go this skews a little towards a sour but it has a few things going on that make it interesting and worth a try, cheers!"
3791,Orca,Fantôme Saison,4.16,"Re-reviewing this one after 12 years since I last had it. 

750mL bottle (best before end of 2025) into a tulip. Pours a clear golden color with a clean bright head, lively carbonation

Wow, the funky aroma on this is pungent! All the usual descriptors—barnyard, wet hay, maybe even dank weed—come immediately to mind. Super strong but not off-putting at all. Just a precursor to the unique flavor in store. 

Taste is, not surprisingly, funky and strong. Super dry, kind of like Orval on steroids. Grassy, acidic, with a subtle crushed-aspirin finish. The pale malt and unique yeast strain compete for dominance, unified by bitter Old World hops (Noble? Hallertauer? Saaz? No idea).

Mouthfeel is dominated by the lively carbonation that bites at the palate but gives each sip (or gulp) a crisp, clean finish. Maybe mouthfeel is where this beer excels most—it’s just so refreshing, like champagne. 

Overall this is just a unique, special beer. Maybe not one I’d go for every day (and at about $23, IIRC, I couldn’t afford to) but this one is different from any other saison out there—it’s simply the most saison-y saison on the market.

4.44/5 rDev +4.2%
look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5
750mL bottle (lot no. b-c, best before Jan. 2013) - thanks tai4ji2x! - poured into a Hennepin glass. Watching a replay of le Tour de France from earlier today, Col du Galibier and Alpe d'Huez - happy belated Belgian Independence Day!

Slightly hazy straw color with a 1-finger head, very minimal carbonation - like almost zero. Huh.

Aroma is typical saison funk, apples, pears, grass, and pepper. Nice and bright.

Taste is very dry and clean - almost like a white wine. Lots of fresh fruit, especially white grapes. Not picking up any Belgian yeasty mustiness, just a dry champagne sweetness, with a lot fewer bubbles.

Mouthfeel is slick, oily, just great.

Now as I get toward the bottom of the second full glass, I'm picking up a Bretty tartness - maybe if I'd cellared this for a year or so there would be more of this.

This saison is extremely drinkable. The only disappointment is the near total lack of carbonation, but even that does not significantly detract from the experience.

It's hard to believe this beer was made with barley and not grapes. It really blurs the line between beer and wine like nothing else I've tried."
3792,MikeWard,Fantôme Saison,3.89,"More of a dry sour saison. Not bad, but a little sweeter would have pleased this palate more."
3793,LiquidAmber,Fantôme Saison,4.35,"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a lightly hazy, medium orange/gold with a four finger white head with great retention and thick lacing; looks nice. Aroma of grainy malt, saison yeast, coriander, lemon and mild summer herbs. Flavor follows with grainy malt, saison yeast with a little funk, coriander, lemon, a touch of honey, apple, hints of light stone fruit; some moderate farmhouse funk in the finish. Medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess. A great, full flavored saison. Hits all the basics of the style in yeast, light fruit, grain and yeast funk. In addition there are wisps of interesting dried fruit and citrus. Great flavor progression with coriander and grain up front and fruit developing over time, finishing with a drier farmhouse funky bite. Dupont saisons are my benchmark for this style and this is as fine or better. This is a really great brewery. So glad they are available again (sporadically) in our area."
3794,flagmantho,Fantôme Saison,4.45,"Poured from 750mL corked & capped green bottle into my BeerAdvocate teku. Bottle says best by end of 2025 -- I should be good.

Appearance: medium golden hue with a bit of haze to the body and a huge effervescence. Head is three thick fingers of frothy eggshell foam that leave a nice lace on the glass. I'm kind of surprised the bottle didn't gush at all, given the huge effervescence and persistent head!

Smell: funky malt with a bit of a spicy character and even just a hint of sourness. Classic, refined, and subtle -- good stuff.

Taste: nice light malt, a little fruity-phenolic character (but not too much!), a little bite, some good bitterness ... this is a damn fine saison. Damn fine indeed.

Mouthfeel: medium body with a big carbonation and just massive creaminess. I love it -- with just a little more body it might be perfect, but it's very, very good as it is.

Overall: I knew this beer was going to be above-average, for sure. But I've had Fantôme beers in a green bottle before, and was underwhelmed. Thankfully this one appears to have been treated right, and it is a treat indeed."
3795,puck1225,Fantôme Saison,4.49,"I am so happy I finally got to have this beer! Wonderful beer! So smooth and full bodied. Funky and sweet, great taste! Nice hoppy bitterness. Lemony and spicy. Poured from a bottle into a tumbler. Beautiful foamy, creamy head atop a hazy golden yellow body. Excellent curtain lacing. Hope to get more!"
3796,MonDak_Joe1953,Fantôme Saison,4.28,"750ml green bottle. Corked and capped.
Mostly clear, pale gold colored body. Lots of pillowy white head; it takes a few pours to get a full glass. Keeps the foam as the beer is consumed.
Aroma is clear with Belgian yeast, with green apple and citrus.
Taste is similar to a champagne but with more yeast (slightly sour, but in a good way). Citrus and pear. Long fade out in the aftertaste.
Medium mouth feel with some effervescence. Hints at dryness, but this is from the yeast. Very expressive carbonation.
Thirst quenching, and has that yeast bite. Yummy."
3797,larryi86,Fantôme Saison,4.31,"750 ml bottle poured into a tulip 

A- A hazy golden copper with a large fluffy white head.

S- Wonderfully funky, apricots, pears, some oak, musty, cloves, earthy spices, some lemon zest, touch of wheat.

T- Funky, musty, pears, some wheat, hints of apricots, cloves, earthy spices, touch of lemon zest.

M- Smooth, lively carbonation, light body.

O- Best Fantôme bottle I’ve gotten so far, taste doesn’t live up to the nose but still a great saison that gets better as you drink it."
3798,Dethark,Black Albert,4.27,"330ml bottle poured into a stemless tumbler style glass.

Look: Pours black as night and next to no head. A tiny tan head that soon buggered off.

Smell: Roasty, toasty malts and dark fruits.

Taste: Dark chocolate, dark fruits, figs, coffee and maybe some licorice.

Feel: Smooth and silky, a more lively carbonation than i'm used to for the style but it does not hurt it at all. 

Overall: A very decadent and luxurious beer than you need to take your time with. The high ABV is there but well hidden."
3799,1BrewBacca,Black Albert,4.08,"I starting to think that beers with a higher ABV never have any head tp speak off. Like this one. Even an aggressive pour did not make one materialize. Then I checked the brew date, over a year and a half ago. Smell and taste of dates and raisins. Quite sweet with a slightly pungent aftertaste. Somewhat flat on the carbonation scale but the 13% ABV is killer. I would like to try another, fresher brew."
3800,janubio,Black Albert,4.02,"Bottle from Las Buenas Pulgas, served at home in a snifter glass.
Black colour, small head with short retention, just a line of lacing.
Aroma of wood, varnish, rubber,raisins, red fruits, chocolate, licorice, anise.
Medium to full body, creamy texture, flat carbonation. Sweet finish.
Taste follows the aroma, with the additon of a spicy notes.
Very good."
3801,NCSapiens,Black Albert,4.02,"If you are looking for a stout with a complex fruit profile this is for you. Lots of chocolate and roasted malt, but also dark fruit, cherry and tobacco create a nuanced experience."
3802,Ushouldbeworkinh,Black Albert,4.29,Batch 0 vintage 2020
3803,puboflyons,Black Albert,4.62,"From a 330 ml bottle with a vintage of 3/22/22 and a BB date of 7/22/26 + 5 years. Sampled June 15, 2023.

Deep dark brown to basically a jet black appearance with a small, quickly fading tan head. Limited lacing.

Many aroma sensations of dark roasted bread crust, dark roasted malts, dark fruit, bkack cherry, plum, cranberry, Graham crackers, cream, licorice, but little to no alcohol for 13%.

Full mouthfeel. Creamy smooth.

Sweet roasted malt taste with more dark fruit and little to no booziness. A lingering warming finish. This is really good."
3804,Nass,Black Albert,4.5,"2016 Vintage. The pour is jet black with a small head of foam. The taste is Belgian candy sugar, bakers dark chocolate, roasted malts, black cherry, & molasses. The 13% abv is drinking more like a 9% abv beer. Cheers! A (World Class)"
3805,SABERG,Black Albert,4.16,"Poured into the test glass, from 11.2 oz bottle with ""BA No. 14 BRS Brew"" on the label. 
A - Chalkboard black, with a thin off white ring of assembled bubbles, a slow moving archipelago in the center of the ring.
S - Burnt brown sugar, cigar wrap tobacco drying in the barn, dark cocoa, hint of soy, and anise.
T - Black pepper corn, bakers chocolate, again a hint of tobacco, with dark fruits being the center, fig, dried plum, with again hint of anise.
M - Medium bordering to to heavy in body, full palate coating while avoiding the ""syruppy"" trap, Start is semi sweet, with lingering bitterness acting as the clean up agent, Finish is just dry enough to invite another sip.
O - A lovely sipper, excellent RIS characteristics, with rich complex flavors, well hidden alcohol, and luxurious texture."
3806,andypeters1971,Black Albert,4.7,"From a bottle 08/2022 at Brick Store, Decatur, Ga. Wonderful aroma, could've just taken in the aroma and not even drank any of it and wouldv'e been great. But the powerful complex array of flavors combined with unbeatable mouthfeel for an imperial stoudt put it over the top"
3807,SHODriver,Black Albert,4.5,"2015 Vintage

A: Poured into a snifter to a black beer which is topped by a dense and rocky finger of dark tan head which fades slowly to a collar around the edge of the glass with minimal lacing
S: Smells of dark roasted malts, bitter dark chocolate, anise, raisins, and espresso
T: Taste is dark chocolate, coffee, roasted malts, hints of oxidation, some slight smoke and charred wood with a hint of burnt sugars. On the swallow there's some sweetness along with more coffee, chocolate, charred wood and burnt sugar
M: This beer is thick and velvety on the palate. Carbonation is low, but adequate for the style while the beer has a drying finish from the high ABV.
O: Overall this is a really well done Russian Imperial Stout. It has good flavors and a nice amount of complexity. It may have lost a step at this age but it's still drinking very well."
3808,Sigmund,Black Albert,4.28,"330 ml bottle, as Struise Black Albert Batch ’0’ - BA No. 14 BRS Brew. ABV is 13%. Pitch black colour, moderate brown head. Exquisite aroma of roasted malts, fine chocolate and coffee, liquorice and hops. Warming mouthfeel. Rich and medium sweet flavour of roasted malts, chocolate, fortified wine and coffee."
3809,Tony210,Good Gourd,4.46,"Pours a dark amber, moderate head. Really nice aroma, loads of pumpkin, very light pumpkin spice, faint cinnamon and allspice. Flavor is rich pumpkin, light pie spice. Has a creamy flavor which is amazing. Medium bodied, pretty viscous. Overall one of my all time favorite pumpkin beers.

1/3/24
12 oz can from 10/2022
4.5 rating"
3810,JohnniEMc,Good Gourd,4.37,"It's good pours that emptied the contents of two twelve ounce cans into a clear glass liter mug. The fit is nearly perfect. There's a tight, but very modest light biege head on top of a richly caramel-brown brew. It's opaque, without being murky and there is some brightness to its color. Pumpkin pie spices are there to smell, with such a good blend, one doesn't outdo another. Possibly cloves, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice and ginger contribute, but it would take an exceptional nose and taste buds to break that down. In this case, it just might be the ginger that leads. Only its body makes a case for this being an ale, not a lager. There's no evidence of hopping. But, this is excellent at delivering a healthy ABV and robust dose of spices smoothly. Maybe too smoothly, as this really just glides down the gullet. As remarkable as is that feat, this is richly spiced, yet so tastefully done. There's even some stratified glass lacing to go along with the enduring head. Final judgment, one of the best in the category."
3811,nasal,Good Gourd,4.43,"Tastes of gingerbread, vague spice and vanilla, raisin. Not nearly as sweet as most in this category, but the vanilla and gingerbread flavors suggest a sweetness. Flat, heavy, uncarbonated mouthfeel, like a barleywine - definitely a sipper, not a session beer. At 8.8%, it's just heavy enough for a kick, but without any hint of ""hot"" alcohol flavor. Never expected to like a ""pumpkin ale"" this much. It's what barely-sweet lebkuchen are to the ultra-sweet American holiday cookies. In this category, only Avery's Rumpkin might beat this for me. Certainly not one of my very favorite beers, but absolutely likeable & a must-revisit."
3812,GeorgianBayPackr,Good Gourd,4.06,"This is a very good Pumpkin Ale. Sweet vanilla on the initial sip, then a fairly high carbonation mouthfeel gives way a smooth and creamy pie-like flavor, with spicy clove lingering. This might improve if to tone-down the clove spice a bit in order to let the other pumpkin pie flavors shine through. Still very nicely done. A pleasant, warming drink"
3813,Bouleboubier,Good Gourd,4.25,"(12 oz can, canned08/16/22; purchased single off shelf... poured into a fat tulip)

L: clear, ruby-burnt-umber colored liquid; huge two-finger orange-tinged foam build... thin, misty collar keeps; does leave some speckled lace

S: nutmeg, ginger syrup, turbinado, spiced rum... not so much pie-like, more spice liqueur... cinnamon pops out after a minute, then pushes to the fore... moderate underlying caramelized malt base, almost maple syrup in shading... the can says 'vanilla' and oh yeah its in there in spades (I repeatedly do not look out for that)... overall excellent intensity and expression, if lacking malt/grain counterpoint

T: the caramel aromas carry over but are gloriously bolstered by bready and baked (crusty) flavors; the finish has a slight (bitter) spice spike accenting the rich, redolent, leathery brown-bready malt... cinnamon and vanilla loom large, but aren't bloated by sugary supplements... it almost has the foundation of a dubbel, drenched in pumpkin pie spice

F: plush-ious, lacking a pungent, pinging bite, despite the booze and spice infusions... toasty bitterness does smack-stun the palate to expectant effect (anticipating greasy fowl noshification)

O: just on the cusp of otherwordly magnificence... it's pretty good; my marks are a shade too low... I'd definitely grab some for the upcoming turkey festivities (2067)"
3814,Rug,Good Gourd,4.2,"Growler filled 11/13/22

Well, I guess I’m making it through all 3 of my growlers from Half Time tonight! The second Pumpkin Beer of the night, and one that has been a long time want of mine. This is a style that I constantly seek the best examples of, and this is the highest ranked one I’ve tried so far, sitting at #4 for the style on BA. I’m excited so let’s just get into it

Pours a cloudy deep reddish brown with a finger of light tan head that fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing

The spice in the nose has a wonderful depth here. I’m picking up on aromas of sweet vanilla, nutmeg, cooked pumpkin, dark toast, earthy cinnamon, herbal hops, light cocoa, and caramel

It has a very balanced taste, sweet and spicy but still authentically pumpkin. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting nutmeg, sweet vanilla, allspice, pumpkin meat, earthy cinnamon, dark toast, raisin, brown sugar, and light toffee. The swallow brings notes of nutmeg, biscuity malt, pumpkin meat, raisin, brown sugar, earthy cinnamon, cocoa powder, light herbal hops, and toffee

A medium body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a smooth beer. Finishes neutral and dries over time

This one is great. It’s still not my favorite of the style but definitely hits the mark"
3815,JokersAce,Good Gourd,3.78,"Brandy caramel in color with a brief white head. Smells like whiskey or brandy, but it's more likely a very pulpy pumpkin character in the aroma. Sipping reveals strong pumpkin flesh characteristics, with some of the stated pumpkin spice notes. This comes off as a mature and rich pumpkin ale. The focus is very much on the pumpkin itself. It's more like a savory pumpkin pie than a sweet pumpkin pie with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream. I can't discern too much cinnamon, but there's a bit of nutmeg and some clove character, but a lot more discernible allspice. I can taste the alcohol as well, and at nearly 9% it is strong. It's alright if you are looking for a pumpkin ale closer to a strong ale or Belgian ale rather than a more casual pumpkin pie type beer."
3816,DrOfGolf,Good Gourd,4.23,"Had this beer straight out of the can. Upon opening the smell is of pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg and malt. The smell was of pumpkin, spices, and a caramel malt. Another good beer from Cigar City."
3817,DrDemento456,Good Gourd,4.35,"So glad they started canning this and a great price at only 11.99 a four pack! My only complaint was the body was quite heavy since this baby clocks in at just under 9% but it met all my marks for a perfect pumpkin ale no vegital notes, good smooth spice flavors and slightly sweet finish. I happily enjoyed two of the cans in one night and will probably be back for more!"
3818,teromous,Good Gourd,3.83,"From the bottom of the can: ""CANNED08/01/22 @11:44 244 2553""

Appearance: The body of the beer looks dark red with a hint of reddish-brown. It allows crisp but dark shadows through the glass. There is a short white cap of a head. Mild retention and spotty lacing. The color is really nice.

Aroma: There is a light bit of cinnamon and allspice on the nose.

Taste: It tastes like a cross between monkey bread and pumpkin pie. There is this caramelized pumpkin flavor up front that is mixed with caramel and bread. Towards the middle it has a bit of a hazelnut flavor with some light nutmeg. Towards the back of the mouth there is a mellow cinnamon flavor.

Mouthfeel: It is a full-bodied beer that is smooth and easy to drink with a light and pleasant warming quality. It feels excellent on the palate.

Overall: As a whole it is an excellent beer. The aroma isn't very prominent but fortunately it has a nice flavor. The can states that it is ""brewed with cinnamon, allspice, cloves, nutmeg, and vanilla."" The spices do a good job of blending together so that they stand out as a cohesive flavor profile rather than one or two stealing the show. It is a good Pumpkin Beer and I would both recommend it and drink it again."
3819,stcules,Oude Gueuze,3.33,"Orange color, quite clean, off white foam, good.
Complex smell, fruity notes, gueuze notes, some baby sick, leather, strawberry-wine.

Looks okay in the glass. Hazy dull orange body. Head dissipates very quickly, no lacing.

Somewhat funky on the nose, even a little cheesy. Barest hint of green apple.

On tasting, a little dry, quite sour. Mild funk, more green apple than the nose suggests.

Mouth barely reaches medium, finish a lasting dry sourness, spikes of bitterness now and then.

Overall, has its merits, but not as good as I was hoping for. Cork was a bit grubby on the edges, perhaps a mild contamination issue?"
3822,jkblr,Oude Gueuze,4.25,"12.7oz green corked & caged bottle notched BOTTLED IN D 2016 (nearly 6 years old) poured into a teku glass at fridge temp 6% ABV. The beer pours mostly bright, soft medium amber in color with short lived, nearly white head. The head recedes to a few scattered bubbles about the perimeter of the glass. No lacing. The aroma is intense (like you can smell it while taking the picture) lemon, orchard fruit, horse blanket, funky cheese and vinegar. The taste is sour, overwhelming so to my palate, but I don't generally care for sour beer. Digging past my initial instinct to quit this bottle immediately, I get waves of citrus, big vinegar, and funky ass bleu cheese. Mouthfeel is thin bodied, highly carbonated and bone dry. Overall, I will capitulate to the BA overall rating of world class for a Lambic Gueuze and rate it accordingly. However, I would not serve this to a sworn enemy dying of thirst..."

Cloudy, pale amber/apricot colored body. Brief off white head. No lacing.
Aroma is leather and grass. Very fragrant. Like its body color there is a hint of stone fruit apricot.
Taste is sour, with tobacco and leather flavors. Also some cut hay. There is the apricot fruit here. The intensity mellows in the aftertaste, with a hint of fruit and oak remaining.
Tart mouth feel, with a drying sensation. Very good carbonation.
Somewhat like a sour white wine, but still somewhat complex."
3824,Sigmund,Oude Gueuze,4.21,"Sample from bottle at RBNAG 2014, Halden, Grand Tasting. Golden colour. Lovely brett aroma, lemony and farmhouse notes. Even better sour flavour with loads of brett and lemony notes."
3825,AElfwine_Nerevar,Oude Gueuze,4.39,"Bottled: April 2016

L: Pours a deep gold with light to light-medium haze. A slightly aggressive pour produces a white 2 finger head with some slight retention. After about 2 minutes the head has faded to a 3 mm ring around the circumference of the glass while the middle of the glass has a thin splotchy sheet of bubbles.

S: Lots of lemons, a hint of green apple, acetic acid, and some earthy and woody funk.

T: I get lemons riding throughout the whole palate with the barnyard funk coming in mid palate and riding to the back end. The back end is the aforementioned lemons and funk but accented by some green apple, oak, and a hint of earth. The finish is pleasantly tart.

F: Light to light-medium body with medium-light carbonation. The mouthfeel is prickly with a bit of dryness on the finish.

O: Complex and well balanced between the fruit and funk with a bit of oak to tie it all together. One of the better gueuzes I have had the opportunity to try. If Iambics are your thing this is highly recommended."
3826,Rug,Oude Gueuze,4.3,"Blend of 2016, 2017, and 2018 lambics, so this was likely blended in 2019

New year, new beer! I'm very excited to try my first Gueuze, and planned to open it for New Year's Day 2021 (more like New Year's Night at this point). Let's just jump straight into this

Pours a cloudy orange gold with just a thin white cap that quickly fades to a ring and leaves no lacing, the carbonation is very visible

A lot of fruit and funk dancing around in the nose. I get notes of apricot, underripe peach, lemon, horse blanket, sharp oak, sweet malt, and a small touch of tobacco, oddly enough for a beer like this

The flavor evolves quite a bit throughout the sip here. What starts off smooth and balanced in sweet and sour, turns into a funky dry tartness. It starts with notes of lemon, white grape, crisp but full malt, and buttery oak that reminds me of chardonnay. The swallow brings notes of sharp oak, leather, tart and funky apricot, apple skin, vinegar, and a light floral character

A light body pairs with moderate carbonation for a very refreshing drinking experience. It feels light than the abv, but finishes a touch too sticky

This was a damn good beer, and I'm happy to have tried the style! I know there's better ones out there, and I'd love to have more. Happy New Year's BA, cheers to a better 2021!"

Very smooth and refreshing.

Really great for a blonde ale, but not as outstanding as 12 is."
3830,Harrison8,Trappist Westvleteren Blond,4.4,"Pours a golden blonde color with a near crystal clear transparency. Head is two fingers of white foam, with more build up after a light swirl of the glass. This frothy, pillowy foam sits a top for a long while after the pour. There is visible sediment at the base of the bottle; however, only the first 3/4 of the bottle were poured into the glass for this review. Aroma is punchy grass, herbal, medicinal, and spicy hops with a big cut of spicy yeast just behind. This yeast comes paired with clove, apple cider, and earthy malts. It smells light, and yet thick; that is to say, the breadth of notes is pretty simple, but the depth to each note is huge. Flavor profile driven by the same characteristics. It pits resiny, herbal, grassy, spicy hops against earthy, bready malt undertones. Clove pairs with spicy yeast for a little further zest and grit. Mouth feel has a sharp effervescence, at least, initially. Effervescence bubbles down to a thin crisp texture. It has a medium thickness. Overall, really stellar depth here, while remaining easy to drink. It's on the 'easier drinking' side of the Belgium spectrum, and yet still retains a remarkable depth. 

Served in a 15.5oz Spiegelau tulip from a 33cl bottle."
3831,pants678,Trappist Westvleteren Blond,3.66,"More yellow than copper, lacing foam.

Clean hops, maybe salt, no malt.

Finishes with more than a touch of hops, hardly bitter, touch of honey. Nothing's really jumping at me. 

Nothing if not easy going and clean and dry."
3832,RaulMondesi,Trappist Westvleteren Blond,4.56,"A lot of the time one simply wakes up because they are alive, but not that they want to. With Westy Blond in the fridge though, I sprung up like James Brown on a line of snow.

And?

Glorious. Just glorious. It doesn’t hit you, it caresses you like Adriana Lima putting on a pair of panties.

I can’t anymore because I need to get back to it.

Be well. Be oh so well."
3833,JonnoWillsteed,Trappist Westvleteren Blond,3.77,"Blind-tasted except for the beer's name and brewery/country, zero reviews below read (yet!)...
L- Pale gold, it was pouring clear until some minor sediment lifted right near the end. 3Cm creamy/lumpy white foam head with some sediment left in the bottle. There is unusually vigorous ongoing small-bubble rising CO2 in the glass. Holds well and forms lacing on the way down.
S- Classic Belgian yeast notes, lightly estery + a hint of spice. Overall a bit subtle though.
T- Follows the smell^ but the hops are brighter and dryer than anticipated (that was my 1st sip of beer today). On swallowing the hops leave a zingy dry brush over my palate that lingers for 10+ seconds. There might also be a fruit note within it too, perhaps apple. - In one respect you could feel this is like a 'hipstered' wheat/wit/weiss beer, it has most of the latter notes but the hops are notably amped up.
F- As above, bright, refreshing, one for a hot summers day. 
O- It's very nice and elegant, there is nothing that seems out of place or balance. - But apart from what I paid for it is it something seriously amazing, well I'm not pursuaded. I've had plenty of other similar style beers to this and this isn't *that* stand-out. So I'll rate it honestly based upon that.
Review #1900. 330ml bottle BB: Not marked, though it tastes fresh and I understand this one has a 12month shelf-life, and the 'Westie 8 and 12' have three years. Bought from Belgium."
3834,puboflyons,Trappist Westvleteren Blond,4.1,"Shared with a friend on June 6, 2021. 

It looks the part with its light amber golden and very heady pour.

The aroma is toasted bread with light Belgian yeast. It is all very subtle.

The body is smooth and light to medium.

The taste was sweet, toasty, and bready with a vague spiciness behind it. It was quite a treat."
3835,Reidrover,Vlad The Imp Aler,4.18,"2020 version 11.8% alc.
Purchased from Westside Taphouse in Salem OR.
Pours a deep golden with a wispy head. Attractive!
Aroma of vinegar and wine. Nice. Some strawberry aspects. Nice.
Taste delicious. Like a bourbon whiskey mixed with sour all. Can really feel the bourbon ageing herd. But the taste is bright and fruity , invigorating.
Lovely mouth feel. Very quenching for a 12 % beer,
A classic from Cascade Lodge"
3836,smcolw,Vlad The Imp Aler,3.94,"Red to orange color. Crystal clear. Decent starting head which settles quickly to mostly rim bubbles. Good streaks for lace. 

Lots of alcohol and other barley wine smells—treacle and berry. 

More sour, which wasn’t present in the smell, than anything else. The sweetness is gone. Decent body with a diminished carbonation level. The tartness is nondescript, simply acidic without a specific flavor. Longer (sour, of course) aftertaste."
3837,BubbleBobble,Vlad The Imp Aler,3.24,"2011 vintage here. Nice pop and good visible carbonation on the pour; no head formation; color is an opaque bourbon orange. Nose has lots of sweet whiskey notes, some deeper boozy wheat notes, light oak, a hint of mild citrus. Spice notes have likely faded, but barrel presence is still there after ten years. Taste has a few fruity, vinous notes up front, but quickly the barrel character takes over in a not entirely pleasant way - a good amount of oak and char, a bit of caramel, some age-related papery notes. Mouthfeel is thin but not unpleasant, and impressive carbonation after all this time. Overall, past its prime, and given how barrel-forward it is, comes across as unbalanced."
3838,Roguer,Vlad The Imp Aler,3.99,"Rating an older bottle, but by any measure this is an unattractive beer: completely flat, with tons of thick floaties in a murky body.

Wonderful nose, a bit sour from the wine, bourbon, and I suspect even the quad. Rich and smooth aroma.

Similar on the palate; the sharpness from the wine dominates (I’m assuming, perhaps incorrectly, that this is not an intentionally soured ale). Nice bourbon presence, although it’s definitely second fiddle here. Lots of oak. Caramel, dark wheat, vinegar, dark fruit."
3839,DaveMaciolek21,Vlad The Imp Aler,4.17,"Amber color with minimal head. I had the 2017 vintage. An unusually high octane (11.6 ABV) sour. Tastes ALIVE--chippered up by the blonde/quad blend, plus zesty citrus orange peel. Bourbon and wine barreling is a subtle part of the flavor profile. The main takeaway is bright and refreshing--from first sip to last."
3840,mbunje,Vlad The Imp Aler,4.48,"On tap at Cascade Barrel House. Really unique beer. Not too sour. Well rounded. Smell the Belgian yeast and the vanilla. Light in the bourbon. Don’t notice the orange peel. 
Flavor is fantastic. Lots of layers going on with a slight tart/sour finish. I feel like every sip is revealing new flavors. Overall this is a must if you visit the brewery or the Portland area. This reminds me of something the Bruery would make or even Russian River. Great beer."
3841,falloutsnow,Vlad The Imp Aler,3.68,"2017 vintage, 11.6% ABV.
Good, but not much more than a very mildly spiced (with orange peel and coriander, the coriander is not able to be tasted, the orange is only a vague sort of citrus character) sour blonde ale of imperial strength that's been aged in barrels (quad and blonde ales aged in bourbon and wine barrels). The alcohol becomes increasingly detracting as the beer warms. Overpriced, would not get again.
Pours a few large, white bubbles, but bottle is still, so no foam or retention. No lacing. Body is a dark golden orange color, with light bringing out (SRM 6-7). Transparent, but plenty of yeast at bottom of bottle.
Aroma is smoothly tart balanced with sweetness, a very pleasant smooth, creamy, sour citrus character (something of a Cascade trademark, you also noticed this aroma in the Citrus Noyaux) mixed with what seems like a hint of cinnamon, some light vinegary notes, and a touch of oak becoming apparent as the beer warms.
Flavor is fairly heavy sourness, fairly strong on acetic acid (apple cider vinegar), but also some tart lactic acid lemon/green apple sourness. Front: tart green apple mixed with an equal amount of apple cider vinegar, light nail polish remover flavor, faintly creamy lemon-citrus notes, slight oak, mild alcohol. Mid: fairly strong acetic acid (apple cider vinegar), moderate lemon and green apple notes from lactic acid, moderate nail polish remover, and moderate alcohol. Back: vaguely defined, though assertive smooth citrus mixed with both lactic (gentle citrus, tart apple) and acetic (cider vinegar) acidity, moderate to strong alcohol flavor, subtle oak. After: lingering lactic acid tartness (lemon/green apple) with acetic acid (apple cider vinegar) close behind, mild dry oak, and medium-low alcohol.
Beer is medium to medium-heavy in body; still, so no carbonation and mouthfeel is exceptionally smooth with no foaming. Alcohol felt fairly easily in the nose and throat, not surprising for an 11% ABV beer, but still not incredible. Closes very dry, with heavy stickiness on the lips and palate.
(D, B, B-, C+, B-/C+)"
3842,smcolw,Chinooker'd,4.29,"Shiny, lighter gold color. Clear. Two finger head which recedes in a rocky fashion. Ample streaks of mildly chunky lace.

Clean aroma of fresh pale malt followed by a lighter floral hop. Very inviting. No alcohol nose.

The flavor is more bitter than the smell. The malt remains solid and predictable. The body is moderate while the carbonation is slightly elevated. The finish is dry and peppery, leaving a long, pleasant aftertaste. Overall, this is a well balanced IPA with excellent complexities. A new top IPA for me."
3843,Pivopijak,Chinooker'd,4.19,"draught
Medium gold/amber color. Subtle, medium toast malt with a subtle allspice type spice aroma, with a rather floral and citrus note. Quite good, a little bitey at first, along with mellow Mandarin orange peel, medium roasted malt and a little tang in the middle of the taste, with the citrus peel, slowly fading to an easy bite."
3844,Sabtos,Chinooker'd,3.59,"Enticing with all kinds of West Coast beauty, the clear gold-amber body has a puffy off-white foam head.

This one's piney, perfumey and--unsurprisingly for Chinook hops--mildly catty. What's throwing me for a loop is just how intensely concentrated the perfumey-ness is. It almost seems like a glass of essential oil.

The body is moderately light, with a crisp then expanding froth, finishing just dry and quite old school bitter."
3845,cjgiant,Chinooker'd,4.65,"Can dated 8/11:
A bit of chill haze on a light golden body; nice head that provides swaths of lacing. Pretty dry, medium light, and fairly clean feel.

Piney and slightly vegetal nose with just a hint of grass (lawn first, then a little dank). There’s a vague and light sweetness, somewhat fructose but I’m not connecting it to a fruit. Taste has a more malty edge to this sweetness, but it’s balanced by a earthy/piney bitterness. Grapefruit pith evolves from this opening, and lingers for a short while before pine regains the ending.

In the end, a pith and pine IPA with a not too sweet malty opening - what I enjoy in an IPA."
3846,sethmeister,Chinooker'd,4.11,"From a can marked CANNED ON 5/11/21

Pours into my tulip glass a clear golden shade with a frothy offwhite to ecru head. Some soapy lace.

Scent is earthy, dank, pungent and a bit skunky

Taste is apples. Mint. Honey. Reminds me of a Honeycrisp apple. A lovely bracing bitterness creeps up as I sip.

Mouth is juicy and lightly oily.

Surprising how divergent the taste and the scent of this one are. Typical excellent Lawson's IPA."
3847,zachary_snackery,Chinooker'd,4.65,"dudes be like “citra this, motueka that,” smh i just miss when ipa’s tasted like a mossy forest"
3848,Shiredave,Chinooker'd,4.34,"Clear, golden amber color, visible carbonation with a dense head and lots of lacing. A quick swirl and the head kicks up releasing ...
... aromas of wet old growth forest, butterscotch on oatmeal and candied orange wedges. Just a terrific throwback to what real IPA's used to smell like, rich in malt that stands up to intense hop terpenes and bitterness.
The flavor is an essay in balance. Rich caramel malt complexity blends neatly into sharp pine and grass hop flavors. Tongue tweaking hop bite tries to dominate but the sweet grain character keeps it all together. 
Body is a heavy medium and the finish is slightly astringent but nicely peppery and warmly boozy. 
I have had many Imperial IPA's that don't have the complexity and backbone this Chinooker'd has."
3849,BeerBaronBear,Chinooker'd,4.25,"Canned 11/17/20, tasted 1/29/21. Excellent American IPA. I was a bit worried that I would find this too overwhelmingly bitter, given the heavy Chinook hop content and giant hop on the label, but this turned out to be a very balanced beer. Rich orange color, somewhat translucent with a bit of haze. Very appealing smell, very fresh and tangy taste, smooth mouthfeel, and a nicely mild bitter aftertaste. Would happily drink this again, even though it's not my absolute favorite style."
3850,Ozzylizard,Chinooker'd,4.39,"Chinooker’d from Lawson’s Finest Liquids. Purchased 0n 4/1/21 for $ 5.00 (Including tax) for 16 oz can ($ 0.313/oz) from Franklin Beer, Franklin, PA. In reefer at store and stored at home at 42 degrees. Reviewed 24/1/21.
Stamped on the bottom “CANNED ON 11/18/20”. Served at 48.9 degrees in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. Final temperature 53.2 degrees. 
Appearance – 4.25.
First pour – Pale Straw (SRM 2), slight chill haze. Second pour is clear and produces 0.5 cm head.
Body – Straw (SRM 3), opaque. When rear-lite, opacity is shown to be due to extremely fine suspended particles and massive amounts of near-microscopic carbonation. 
Head – Average (Maximum 3.2 cm, aggressive center pour), floral white, medium density, average retention, leaving a five to seven mm crown with a cross-cut saw blade edge, fed by effervescence, and a thin partial cap with many rocks. Inserting the thermometer causes an upwelling of tiny bubbles.
Lacing. Good. Wide band of tiny to small bubbles with an occasional hole, like torn cheesecloth.
Aroma – 4.5 – Burst of resinous pine when can opens, quickly weakens allowing some weak generic citrus to sneak through, no malt, no yeast. 
Flavor – 4.5 – Begins with generic citrus and resinous conifers, no malt, no yeast, slightly bitter. No alcohol (6.5 % ABV, as marked on container) taste or aroma. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl. Ends with a mild but resinous bitterness, sans citrus and pine, but with some malt present.
Palate – 4 – Medium, almost watery, mouthful of soft carbonation.
Final impression and summation: 4.25 Nicely resinous and piney IPA, reminiscent of the pre-fruity days."

3852,mpk2020,Gratitude,4.25,Draft at the brewery in Pittsburgh
3853,CarolinaCardinals,Gratitude,4.43,"Received a can of East End Gratitude from @DIM 8-24-23. Canned 2-3-23; consumed 12-23-23.

Beer poured a tea-colored brown with a very nice off-white head that is leaving some lacing behind.

Nose is very nice, getting a very nice combination of dark fruits and fresh citrus.

Taste is very well executed! The large malt base gives me notes of caramel, figs, and brown sugar. Hop bill is giving a strong dose of orange and grapefruit with the finish giving a nice pine bitterness; 8/10 on my scale.

Mouthfeel is medium to large bodied with each sip being silky smooth.

Overall this could be Bigfoot's big brother, very similar. Glad i got the opportunity to try, thanks Dan!"
3854,M-Fox24,Gratitude,4.32,"A: A bole toned decant with a burnt umber aid through the emissions, while the carafe transpires a canvas brown invention. The process is repeated upon the timed stagnations, where the transfers offer/develop a nuanced clarity. At the outset, a complementary collar that briefly supersedes the inch, by suggesting a unison amongst polypeptides & acids. This comes with a bisque to champagne tinge, as the progression works to sever that stature thru a golden fog rim. Accordingly, a severance that offers an elegant latticework, from the refined residues, without obligatory tension. In time, a viscosity element over the painted – monastery – windows, as the increments capitulate a heating engraving 

S: A malt to yeast webwork that’s pitted against a new level, of aged refermentation, as the hop effect distantly grows. The entryway hints at the components most found in a Stroopwafel, aside the rich caramel conveys. Moreover, an isoamyl octanoate undercoat to the more direct – dark – fruit bearings, where figs atop flame raisins, before softly ciphering in Pflaumenmus. There is a deciduous camphor airstream in circumference, which adds a mint to menthol element, while a coniferous scots builds upon the bittering strengths. Correspondingly, an earthy headway amongst the woodsy incursions, as hyssop connotations develop, beyond the clove & marjoram orifices. The starch-to-sugar conversions have lessened over the timespan, which lends a relaxed saccharification to the aforementioned pillars. A movement that addresses the vintage through a smart solvency, given the calculated repression on oxygenation. This comes not only with the years, but with phased transfers across balmy – hourly – increments. To that extent, an ethyl acetate reflection that involves a nuanced perception on sherry, for getting Amontillado to reach Latakia tobacco 

T: The timeworn has elevated the initial sensitivity on the diastatic enzyme conversions to a new level, which augments the sweetness, by progression. As a result, the gustation is more relaxed on the greenery counters, as the grain bill pushes those bready to doughy reserves. Albeit, a hop effect that remains central to the course, while esters assist in the hourly altitudes. The dispatches are therefore rich in malt outputs, by slinging heath bars aside Torta de nata. Coupled with, barhi dates & dried goji berries, as the yeast draws on an ethyl hexanoate chord. This being the implied red fruits with an aniseed cast, while a colophony sphere mitigates. Due to that fact, a tactful hop impact to impart pine needles near dry cedar wood, while contextualizing floral bouquets. There is a citrus – grapefruit – bitter articulation thru the expansion, which accompanies the candied stone fruits, as acetates build off the clocked intervals. Meanwhile, a distant decant subjected to open air, besides the added years, for degassed complexities over Bustrengo. The notes persevere on the heated draws near Bärenjäger & smoked lavender, while lightly addressing the behaviors most akin to phenylethanols with a caproate partnership. Sequentially, the vintage escorts the 4th hour @ a >78°F interval to lend Madeira, by suggesting Malmsey, which pursues an oxidized nuttiness. A continuation that implores burning Grow houses under elderly Dunskins, beyond the fiery red grounds 

M: Cut – bygone – ebullitions amidst a refined adhesiveness, which amends sweetness against the fermentable complications. A warming surface structure that’s smooth upon equalizing, from an age-old viscosity to a calm desiccation. The output is time-honored with an intrinsic richness, as ethanol smartly burns over an attenuated cessation, while a suppressed bite rearguards the aridity 

O: An oxidized comfort with a refermented/conditioned involvedness, which kindles a fine silkiness without barrel foreplay. Accordingly, a non-barrel aged vintage that swaps esters, for the more habitual acetates, when calming the greeneries. In this case, the added time is paired alongside an uncapped & decanted patience, as a way to recognize the impact contingent on evaporation and oxidation"
3855,Beersnake,Gratitude,4.3,"Poured from a can at fridge temp. Pours a murky orange with a thin layer of head. Nose is wonderful - toffee candy all the way. Werther's. Raisins, plums, a touch of minty pine, maple, and a slight citrus peel note. 

The taste is awesome. A perfect balance of sweetness and slight bitterness from the hops. Wow. Toffee, pine, citrus peel, raisins, figs, candy, big malty note, bread, and alcohol heat. Really well done. 

The mouthfeel is dry, medium bodied, and nicely warming. Some alcohol bite is there. The aftertaste is primarily citrus peel bitterness. Overall, a wonderful example of an American Barleywine. I can't wait to see how these age for a little while."

3857,Roy_Hobbs,Gratitude,3.73,"Pours a bright, almost glowing light amber. Plenty of head that for some reason reminded me of a tan macaron in both color and texture. Overall, this is an attractive beer. 

Aroma is sweet caramel and molasses with fig and some light alcohol lurking. It's fairly reserved overall, in that nothing bursts from the glass. That said, it still smells quite good. 

On the tongue, the alcohol makes a clear and immediate impression, as does the bite from the hops. The malts definitely take a back seat. There's a little bit of sweetness, but it's clearly secondary. 

Full bodied and silky smooth. There's a little bit of alcohol warming on the way down, but it's subdued. Low to medium carbonation. Very long finish. 

Overall, a good Saturday sipper!"
3858,Fordcoyote15,Gratitude,4.36,"Not sure how I dont have this rates?! I've had it several times before.

I'll rate this 2022 can

The amber hue is beautiful. Also noting hefty sediment st the bottom of the glass.

The smell isn't mind blowing. Its fairly benign and unassuming.

The flavor profile is very bigfoot-esque but definitely better. Its less bitter than Bigfoot and has more caramel sweetness. Still, a pretty bitter and quintessential example of an American barleywine. In fact... i would argue this is probably THEE American barleywine measuring stick. Bigfoot is just too much of a palate wrecker though it does convey all the aspects to familiarize one with the style. Gratitude does it equally as well but with more refinement IMO.

The feel is a little sticky up front but dries out quickly on the finish as you exhale an evaporating heavy dose of ethanol.

Overall Im drinking this one at cellar temperature of about 57ish and I'm not enjoying it quite as much as I recall previously. Could be a beer thats better more chilled, could be I'm off (very likely), or could be accurate at 4.25.

---

Drinking this again on 12-2-22 this time chilled. This is arguarbly the best American barleywine I know and blows Bigfoot away with balance and refinement. Bumping twste and overall from 4.25 to 4.75 each for being the arguably best ive experienced per style."

3862,Lanoke12,Duvel,4.48,Look is light beautiful blonde. Smell is sweet Belgian ale yeast. Taste is sweet with full flavored blonde malt. Feel is thick and full bodied. The original strong Belgian Blonde. A usual for Belgian lovers.
3863,SLeffler27,Duvel,4.33,"A huge, fluffy white head holds 3"" for a long while before gradually turning rocky and forming a large dens pillow. This Belgian Lace coats the Duvel tulip glass. The Strong Ale itself glows with pail gold while a wide column of fine bubbles vigorously flows in an upwards plume to reinforce the head. The head never comes close to dissipating.

The quintessential Belgian funk of spice, banana, fallen apple and sourdough bread is unmistakable and elegantly potent. Faint pine needles follow with sweetness. Warmth brings light celery and perfume.

The flavors are less pronounced than I recall from earlier bottles. Never the less, flavor follows aroma, adding pear. A quick sharp bitterness bookends sweetness in each sip. Lemmon and banana just before a long spicy finish which included alcohol and watercress.

The body is light to medium with a raspy texture, that likely has more to do with the tremendous carbonation than the body itself. Alcohol is as expected.

This is rightfully an iconic beer and one that ought to be more regular in the line-up. I love to sip this while sitting quietly and think it would serve equally well as an accompaniment to casual conversation."

3868,Cramshawbar,Porter,2.63,"Let's get things straight: Founders kicks butt when it comes to CBS and KBS. No one comes really close. But they also make duds and this is one of them. 
Its claims of roasted coffee, graham cracker sweetness, mild bitterness all come through as fibs. This is merely a thin porter with some mild coffee aftertaste. It's also mostly a quite bitter malt bomb. Not what I was going for and I don't know what they were aiming at. I bought two of these, but I might dump the second bottle."
3869,HardCider,Porter,4.23,"This beer pours an opaque coffee color withaa large caramel color head. It has a malty, sweet caramel aroma. Although the arome is somewhat vague. The primary taste is coffee with a very nice level of bitterness and sweetness. The texture is smooth and creamy."

And to be frank I am not expecting the most notable flavor to be ""bitter"" in a beer. I'm fairly new to porters, but I roast my own coffee and have for ages. And this has a beautiful tan head and some black coffee coloration. But that's where the coffee stops and bitter begins. In my eyes your better off just avoiding porters. So much better stuff out lately they need to up their game!"

3879,IPAs_for_days_13,Harvest Ale,4.47,"L: Pours a nice hazy orange color with a tall beige head with great retention. 
S: Smells super fruity, decent amount of citrus, super piny, nice malt backbone, little bit of melon. 
T: Follows the nose, has a great balance between the biting hops & the sweet malt backbone!
F: Full-bodied, moderate carbonation, warming, crisp, biting, slightly oily. 
O: Really impressed by this brew! Will definitely buy again."
3880,DLG2,Oak Aged Yeti Imperial Stout,4.17,"For me this is a great change of pace beer. I drink mostly light beers but I need a change up after 3 or 4 light beers, one of these stouts is a perfect change. Then back to a few light beers. I love the flavor and everything else about this beer. I know this isn’t the proper wine snob way to rate a beer, I just can’t do that."
3881,Sigmund,Oak Aged Yeti Imperial Stout,4.4,"On tap at Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. Pitch black colour, low brown head. Lovely aroma of oak, roasted malts, dark chocolate and coffee, hints of leather. Roasty flavour, dark malts, coffee, oak, hints of chocolate and liquorice. Nice bitterness in the finish."
3882,dcotom,La Folie,4.18,"On tap at George's Local, Cedar Falls, IA; served in a ""snulip"" glass. Deep garnet-tinged brown in color, with a thin off-white head. Dark-bready malt backbone provides a backdrop for the notes of sour berries and cherries, with a little mild funk. Good carbonation, medium bodied, and a slightly woody finish with some tartness lingering on the palate. Outstanding beer, highly recommended."
3883,Radome,La Folie,4.21,"Tasted from a 500 ml corked bottle in a red wine glass.

L - Beautiful ruby red color and very clear. Light tan head fades quickly to a thick ring around the glass and a few wisps on the surface. Swirling the beer reveals light lacing and ""legs"" on the glass like a strong wine shows.

S - Nose is an interesting blend of sweet brown ale with red wine and berry notes, and a sharp, acidic note with some barnyard funk at a low level.

T - The barnyard funk and sour acidity dominate the flavors, but is some depth that reveals other flavors. I get blackberry jam and oak, but the base of Flemish brown ale is not detectable to me.

F - Thin body with low carbonation. Hops bitterness is not detectable because the acidic sourness is so strong it masks any other sensation on the tongue. It also give a sharp bite in the throat. Alcohol presence is also drowned out by the acid, except for some esters detectable in the finish. 

O - This is an unabashedly funky and sour beer, but totally over the top compared to the Belgian versions of Flemish Brown I've had. Still, this does have delicate touches that make it more than just a sour monster."
3884,TheBrewDude52,La Folie,3.6,"balanced, a little apple taste."
3885,NCSapiens,La Folie,4.13,"Straight down the middle sour. Funky apple, vinegar, oak and cherry. Good carbonation and finishes dry. Earthy with barnyard grass, malt, oak barrel vanilla, spicy caramel malt, red wine, hay, and grape. Sour but not overly so. The finish has a brown ale malty bluntness. I went to college in Boulder but this is my first time having this beer. I see why it it is an American classic of searching for European greatness."

New Belgium Brewing Company

Sour-Flanders Oud Bruin

The classic sour. Produced way before it was mainstream popular. This aged sour had tangy apple, metallic sharp earthy funk, cherries and amber malt aspects. The French barrel flavor and feel is very mellow and provides an excellent subtle depth.

3887,JokersAce,Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier Dunkel,3.99,"Like a hefeweizen but more caramelized hence a somewhat more banana bread like character. Not really my favorite style per se, but still good and can recognize the quality. Golden dark amber in color with a white head that dissipates. Decent carbonation but nothing crazy. Malts are pretty caramelized, a tad bit more bitter than a regular hefeweizen, though also somewhat sweet. The fresh wheat of a hefeweizen is replaced by a more caramel malted note, and the characteristic yeast taste in the sip is notably absent. The banana bread noted in hefeweizen is definitely turned up a notch and bit more forward and prevalent, maybe even with a slight chocolate note but almost like a necco wafer. Pretty decent, drinkable and rich and traditional."
3888,greenjeff4141,Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier Dunkel,4.55,"Purchased at ABC in Central FL in a pint bottle. Pours a hazy, tea color with a creamy light tan head. Smells sweetly of wheat, banana bread, and yeast. Taste is very mild - raisins, very slight sourness, a little dry, and the carbonation is delicate. The beer is very smooth and easy to drink. Reminds me of a hefeweizen, but with more developed and rich flavor. Very balanced and fantastic overall. I haven't had a beer like this in some time. I think it might be the best I've had in a while. It was gone way too quickly."
3889,nizzle8287,Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier Dunkel,4.52,"A beautiful amber color with beige head that is luscious and beautiful, with very fine bubbles. 
Smell is sort of a nice light caramel mixed with a bit of wheat and banana.
Taste is caramel mostly with a hint of banana, not as sweet as I was expecting, which is a good thing I think
Mouth feel is very velvety and medium full in body. Alcohol is almost not detectable
Overall a fantastic brew from one of my favorite breweries, and this certainly was a treat to try.
Would I buy again? I would if I could get it in a 6 pack. Only on special occasions for this one."

3892,mariposafan,Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier Dunkel,4.2,"Look: medium brown with a tall, but short lived, head.
Smell: a bit subdued compared to their (amazing) hefeweissbier.
Taste: The traditional hefeweizen flavors are there, but seem to be masked by the malt, making it a little biscuity. It’s still nice, but it seems to be neither one thing or the other.
Feel: Light and effervescent.
Overall: It’s nice, but I’m coming to the conclusion that dunkelweizens aren’t quite my thing."
3893,BillyNoonan,Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier Dunkel,4.4,"Dark and rich, complex and earthy. Oaky, bready with texture and beautiful complexity. Aromas and tastes of banana bread, slight cloves and pecan with a crisp finish then rich aftertaste. Dark mahogany and rich, luxurious mouth feel. Gorgeous."
3894,SudsMcE,Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier Dunkel,4.9,"My personal favorite from Weihenstephaner and my favorite dunkel overall. Sometimes it’s a little different to locate locally but it’s a solid choice that I buy whenever I see it. If you like dunkles, try it you’ll love it."
3895,Mark-Leggett,Aventinus Eisbock,4.46,"Poured from a bottle. Dark in color with a small head. Smells of fruit with hints of dark fruit like figs and dates in the forefront. Sweet dark fruit on the tongue, kind of like fruit cake only good."

3897,HipCzech,Aventinus Eisbock,4.16,"Serving: 11.2 fl oz bottle poured into a 9 oz Libbey Embassy snifter glass.

Appearance: Pours a murky dark to medium brown with a restrained froth a tan foam and little lace.

Smell: Plush aromas of dark and dried fruit, caramel, and boozy fruitcake.

Taste: More dark, dried fruit (sultanas, figs, dates), dark bread and cake, fruity yeasty esters, caramel, and some balancing of earthy hops.

Mouthfeel: Full bodied, creamy, silky smooth with medium carbonation and warming alcoholic heat.

Overall: A masterful complex yet integrated wheat beer packing a big malty punch."
3898,BGDrock,Aventinus Eisbock,4.22,"Medium-light brown head with tan tint, unfiltered and murky, forms a sandy, inch high head, with good retention of a minute or two
Aroma of sweet grain & fruity malt, unfiltered apple cider, champagne grapes, raisins, yeast spice.
Taste of sourdough bread, or a rye, raisin-butter twist pastry, masterfully balanced by bittering hops and soothing alcohol heat as you head towards the finish; feel is soft and full like a pillow, with a medium body and superfine carbonation; as time goes on, a touch of milk chocolate shows up.

Wonderfully malt-forward flavour, yet so well balanced by other elements that it's not as sweet as I'd feared."
3899,cambabeer,Aventinus Eisbock,4.66,"11.2 Ounce bottle purchased in Lucerne Switzerland. 

Pours a mostly cloudy brown with deep rust notes when the light catches it. One centimeter head, light with the slightest tan note. Nose is clove, alcohol, prune, wheat, pumpernickel, molasses, plum. Taste follows with boozy notes throughout, raisin, dark bread, wheat, pomegranate, sweetness. Finish is full bodied, slickness from the alcohol, and warming, with the same wheaty fruit notes sticking around. Fantastic."
3900,mpruden,Aventinus Eisbock,3.8,"Poured from an 11.2 oz bottle at fridge temperature into a glass mug.

Look: Dark apple cider with a massive beige head that mostly dissipated within a couple minutes, leaving some lacing, which then also disappeared.

Nose: Light scent of stone fruit with a bit of brown sugar.

Mouthfeel: Very thick, adequate carbonation.

Attack: Follows the nose, plus alcohol. A little more malt flavor as the beer warms.

Finish: All alcohol.

Overall: This is my first Eisbock ever, so I’m hard put to know what to compare it to. It seems to fit the BA style description well. It reminds me somewhat of a Wee Heavy, but I like a good Wee Heavy better. I don’t think this’ll be my favorite beer or style, but that’s not a good reason to downgrade it."
3901,USArmyRangerVet,Aventinus Eisbock,5,"Wow, just wow. Superb."
3902,Ushouldbeworkinh,Aventinus Eisbock,4.02,"Deep amber colour. Head lingers longer than expected. Smell is fruity, caramel and boozy. Something seems familiar, but I can't quite name it. Taste is very much the same with a lingering warmess. Freeze distillation does it make more boozy than other beers of the same abv. Feel is smooth and sweet. First time I've really liked a German beer."

3904,jjamadorphd,Aventinus Eisbock,4.49,"Fantastic doppelbock...

Pours out like liquid caramel, dark caramel, but thick and rich as I would imagine it would. The smell is sweet and malty with just enough of the booze to let you know it will warm you up quick...and boy does it. Mouthfeel, though carbonated, is thick and full-bodied which makes up for it. Great beer, kinda off the style, but a welcomed experience."
3905,Spade,Aventinus Eisbock,4.44,Dark coppery-red body with a thick beige head. The flavor is alcohol with malty sweetness and a hint of toffee. The finish has some slight hoppiness with the cleanness of a lager. If this isn't perfect it's very close.

S: Sweet, mature, slightly earthy. Fleeting raspberry on the first whiff, a few mineral notes, caramel, fig, and lots of honey bourbon. 
T: Less fruity than the nose. A touch of berries up front, even a bit of tartness, quickly overpowered by boozy caramel, hints of toffee, fig, a slight malt driven bitterness, and lingering roasty bourbon notes. 
F: Smooth, hot. 
O: It’s a big boozy dark beer, of course it’s good. Blind, would I guess it’s a quad? Nope. But, you have to expect that with these types."
3908,Saluki,Bourbon Barrel Quad Barrel-Aged Ale (BBQ),4.34,"Pretty well balanced between the rich tasting malts, chocolate flavors and the 12 abv. 

Can taste why it doesn't get a 98-100 as it is a strong beer with a slight bitterness. Little light on the smoothness.

Bourbon barrel aging is not a traditional beer style and imo why an ABT 12 or other top tier Trappist/style is really tough to beat. The best aged beer is best aged in glass. It's like the local craft guys in town, always experimenting to no end with the hops and flavorings.

Bought four, think the next three will last."
3909,Rwoodroffe,Bourbon Barrel Quad Barrel-Aged Ale (BBQ),4.4,Beautiful reddish amber color with a lightly colored head. Sutle aroma but strong sweet bourbon flavor.

Smell: cloves, banana bread and mild brown sugar up front followed by figs and fruit and then the bourbon hits you, very lovely aroma.

Taste: Bourbon upfront, banana bread and roasted malts followed by mild fruit and then a very mild bitterness mixed in with brown sugar. The alcohol really hits you in the aftertaste and leaves you wanting another sip.

Feel: This is a medium to full bodies ale, very smooth and crisp and just envelopes your tongue with flavor.

Overall: A very pleasant beer and very tasty with no regrets, don't pass it up."

3913,RaulMondesi,Broo Doo,4.18,"Take this review with a grain of salt (or hops - lolz, damn, Raul, you slay), because this is wet hop beer and that season was like months ago (there is no bottle date).

Anyway, let’s get down to the nitty gritty.

All things wet. All things wet… (get your mind out of the gutter, my children). Yes. Ester Williams, that Phelps dude when he isn’t taking bong rips, Kelly Slater in a barrel… All said, the beer is still good and you should be too (good to your mama at least). 

Ok, let’s go."
3914,Darkmagus82,Broo Doo,4.05,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass
Appearance – The beer pours a clear orange-golden amber color with a small white head of foam. The head has a decent level of retention, fading over time and leaving a bit of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – The aroma is big of a bready and malty smell mixed with some squash like aromas and some light harvest fruits of apple and pear. Along with these smells comes a musty grassy and herbal smells, as well as some notes of pine and dirt.
Taste – The taste begins with a bready and slightly grainy flavor that is paired with a touch of caramel sweetness. There is a big fresh hop taste upfront, being very green in nature with a sizable taste of pine, earth, and herb. As the taste advances the fresh hop gets even stronger, while the caramel sweetness fades a touch. Toward the end, the bready increases, and with a touch of mustiness and some hints of orange and pear, one is left with a nicely hoped harvest ale like flavor to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body is medium in thickness and chewiness with a rather average carbonation level. Good for the style and the tastes, balancing well support of the flavors and a more easy drinking nature.
Overall – A nicely hopped up harvest ale. Quit tasty."
3915,Treyliff,Broo Doo,4.33,"12oz bottle poured into a SA perfect pint glass

A- pours deep amber with a two-finger foamy and pillowy white head that retains forever

S- smells of resinous pine, zesty citrus peel & floral hops, with some malty biscuit undertones

T- bright and zest orange peel up front is quickly complimented by some resinous pine. Mid-palate brings out some doughy sweet malt before giving way to a blast of floral hops. The finish gives notes of orange marmalade and pine

M- medium body with moderate carbonation leads to a foamy mouthfeel that turns creamy into a smooth finish 

O- solid example of a classic west coast ipa, bright and well balanced"
3916,jdhops,Broo Doo,4.07,"Undated bottle. Perhaps bottled 9/1/23 per other reviews and instagram.

L: Pours a dark orange that is less than clear. Short but stubborn white head. Very pretty splotchy lacing.

S: Muted aromas of sweet caramel malt. Typical fresh hop aroma is absent.

T: Malty sweetness up front. The hops appear in the middle. Finishes dry and bitter.

F: Medium mouthfeel and carbonation.

O: Gets better during the sip, going from sweet malt to bitter hops. The beginning is unwelcome, the middle is encouraging, and the end is nice. Perhaps an unfair comparison, but the fresh hop character - in both aroma and taste - is nowhere near Washington and Oregon fresh hops IPAs. The lacing is terrific, though."
3917,VABA,Broo Doo,4.25,"Pours a nice amber color with a slight head and lacing
Aroma has pleasant malt and hop hints
Taste has a bitter malt and hoppy flavor
A medium bodied well carbonated beer
A good IPA"
3918,cjgiant,Broo Doo,4.33,"On tap:
Mid amber and pretty clear after the chill haze subsided. Lacing is ok, but the recuperation ability of the head is more impressive. Nose is the sweeter side of floral citrus with a spicy sensation thrown in. Inhaling more deeply, an earthy to piney aroma squeezes in. First sip showed the qualities of a mid-2010 IPA with a medium plus malt backbone that avoids sweetness and a piney bitterness. After a few sips to adjust, I get more of the citrus that the nose exhibited, mixed nicely with the green pine from the first sips. Finishes pretty dry and bitter - in I way I appreciate."
3919,GuyFawkes,Broo Doo,3.27,"Bottled 9/1/23; drank 9/24/23 @ the Yarchives. 

See-through dull orange appearance. 

A rough pour yielded a nice off-white head; a thick curtain of tree-rung lacing remained. 

Fresh pine orange citrus & faint orange peel notes in the nose. 

Medium thin mouthfeel. Strong pine, weed resin, mild caramel & orange peel flavors. 

Too resinous & pine-y for this timid soul...but wet hop apologists are sure to love it."
3920,ommegangpbr,Broo Doo,4,"Bottled 9/9/2022. The first thing that comes to mind is ""IPA flavored"". This is solid all around from start to finish. There is nothing special, to me, that marks this brew but if I saw this available on tap I'd be thrilled.
Medium to thick bodied on the palate. Sticky hop bitterness with a mix of pine and citrus. If you know you don't like IPAs then this will not change your mind. But! If you know you like the style then this is one to throw into the mix of options. I generally prefer a lighter flavor and mouthfeel but I do like this beer."
3921,Roy_Hobbs,Juliet,3.52,"Bottled April 15, 2016. Nice, bright dirty orange beer with excellent clarity and a short amount of fizzy head. Aroma is all kinds of musty funk, barrels and jammy fruit. Taste is largely what I would have expected based on the nose, with plenty of acidity, funk and oak. While I know blackberries were used, I can't detect them (go figure for an almost 7 year old beer). Light and effervescent. 

Overall, good, but not great. Given the high level of acidity it will be interesting to see if I can knock out this entire 765ml.....we'll see."
3922,SABERG,Juliet,4.16,"Poured from the 2012 version 750 ml bottle. Bottled 1/26/2012
A - Copper/ruby colored backdrop. excellent clarity, gently carbonated. A thin ring of evidence lasts the duration
S - Fruit skins, musty basement, earthy wheat base is in the mix.
T - Wonderful tension between fruit and yeast. The Blackbeery and Wine barrel dance beautifully
M - Crisp, tart/sweet/tart its a tug of war on the palate. Linger is outstanding
O - A delight from the basement, Fruit stands out, with all the edges from a wine barrel aged offering in place.
Sadly my last bottle."

Goose Island 
Date: 2016
Time to start bringing some heavy hitters to the party. I used my Jester King glass and served it around 46 degrees. The pour created a light tan airy head. The retention of the head is poor and left no lacing on the glass. I did expect that from this beer, not many wild ales have long-lasting billowy, thus far in my career of beers. The color is a dark strawberry orange. The beer is mostly clear, with lots of carbonation. The appearance of the beer is thought-provoking and mesmerizing. 

The aromas are horse blanket, jammy, berries, lightly toasted malts, earthy, oaky, vinous, crackers, a hint of floral, funky, and a touch of barnyard. 

The flavors are earthy, jammy, berries, lightly toasted malts, a fruity sweetness, vinous, oak, spicy rye, floral ester, funkiness, barnyard, horsey, crackers, and slight herbal note. 

The mouthfeel is tannic, dry, tart, and acidic.

The body of the beer is medium, medium-high carbonation, and has a long finish. 

This beer is a marvel. The flavors are bright and acidic; yet complex and harmonious. The aging of the beer benefited it. The beer has so many nuances that; it is hard to detect them all out. Excellent wild ale; I am glad I got the chance to drink this beer five years later."

3929,Gajo74,Juliet,4.04,"On tap at Divebar, NYC.

Pours a clear amber color with a moderate head, retains decently for the style, and yields a ring of lacing.

Vinous aromas of sweet and sour grapes and a strong lime tartness. The tartness also evokes plain yogurt and gentle notes of Bret funk. The rye and barrel aging evoke spicy and woody aromatics respectively.

Tart throughout with notes of lemon, lime and yogurt. Vinous Cabernet flavors, fruity with notes of red and green grape, pear, green apples and berries. Spicy rye, wood, oak, Bret and peppery spices contribute to the complexity. Medium bodied with an acidic mouthfeel, crisp carbonation and bone dry finish. 

Complex and with quite the acidic bite. Well crafted overall."

Taste is sour, with some lemon tartness. Overall a dry experience. Lots of berry and wine barrel. Underlying grassy funk.
Medium mouth feel, with good supportive carbonation.
The sourness level slows the ingestion rate, but any quaffs are rewarded with the bittersweet mix of berry, oak, and funk."

Sadly, as this warmed the pickle juice took over. Not very good."
3936,FBarber,Baltic Porter,4.28,"Bottle Conditioned - May 2015.

Pours pitch black and oily. Thin tan head dissipates steadily leaving just a thin ring of mocha colored foam along the outside of the beer. Beer appears thick and viscous when poured. 

Aroma has notes of cocoa, dark fruits, roasted malts, and molasses. Very nice aroma albeit somewhat subdued - however that is to be expected given the age of this bottle. 

Taste is quite smoky with notes of roasted and smoked malts, molasses, chocolate, and dark fruits. Incredibly complex array of flavors. Not a ton of hops here, but again, not unexpected given the age of this bottle. The smokiness here really is quite lovely. No bitterness is left on the finish. 

Feel is thick with a nice heft to it. Semi-dry finish. Light vibrant carbonation. 

Overall this is a lovely beer and the age on this has done nothing but wonders."

The beer pours very dense, dark brown with a little bit of light brown head. The head recedes to a paper thin coating with a sheet of lacing working down the glass as consumed. The aroma is dark charred malt and a little bakers dark chocolate. The taste is roasty malts up front, then a little tangy flavor & maybe a little dark fruit, finishing with a big semisweet chocolate finale. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, well carbonated with a wet, yet uncloying finish. Overall, very good. I had cellered this bottle since 2015 and it makes me sad this is not available locally anymore. Recommended."

T — Leads with a good amount of dark chocolate, well-roasted barley malts, and smoke. Followed by hints of dark roast coffee, molasses, and candied prune 
F — Moderately thick, silky mouthfeel. Medium carb. Restrained bitterness on the finish 
O — Reminds me a lot of Smutty’s Robust Porter, although a little more intense. Somewhat surprised that this is currently BeerAdvocate’s highest rated beer in New Hampshire since it’s pretty nondescript overall (although still well put together!)

3940,UWDAWG,Ivan The Terrible Imperial Stout - Barrel-Aged,4.32,"2022 version:

Poured from a 19.2 ounce can into a snifter.

Look- Black, opaque, medium brown frothy head, average lacing, above average head retention.

Smell- Bourbon, oak, vanilla, high strength of scent.

Taste- Bourbon, oak, vanilla, mildly spicy, medium strength of flavor.

Feel- Between thin and medium body, mildly creamy, average carbonation, mildly bitter, mildly spicy.

Overall- Black and opaque with a frothy medium brown head that had above average retention. Bouquet was predominantly bourbon with some notes of oak and vanilla. Taste was bourbon soaked with some slight oak and vanilla character. Feel was better thin and medium body with mild spice, bitter and creaminess. Overall this beer provided an enjoyable drinking experience with great bourbon flavor, but lacked complexity. Also, feel was much thinner than expected and didn’t provide any mouth coating properties."
3941,jkblr,Ivan The Terrible Imperial Stout - Barrel-Aged,4.18,"19.2oz can vintage 2022 marked 300228 on bottom of the can poured into a nonic pint glass at just above fridge temp 13.9% ABV per label. The beer pours completely black with no light penetration and medium brown colored head. The head recedes to a thin ring and island. Minimal lacing. The aroma is mild with roasted malt notes and a little oak. Bourbon becomes evident as the glass warms. The taste is bittersweet roasted malt with additional bourbon, oak and vanilla all coming through. Moderate bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with just less that average carbonation and a mostly dry finish. ABV is fairly well disguised with just a bit of heat on the tongue and tummy. Overall, very good."
3942,Sigmund,Ivan The Terrible Imperial Stout - Barrel-Aged,4,"Sep. 2011: Shared 750 ml bottle, thanks to gunnar. Vintage 2010, ABV 10%. Bottle No. 3495 out of 3800. Pitch black colour, rich tan head. Intense aroma of bourbon and vanilla, oak and molasses, roasty notes in the background. The fairly sweet flavour is roasty with notes of dark chocolate and coffee, also molasses, bourbon, vanilla and oak. Lovely stuff."
3943,Stevedore,Ivan The Terrible Imperial Stout - Barrel-Aged,4.1,"2012 edition. Actually not bad. Not oxidized at all. Smooth roast, chocolate, touch of espresso and mild warming heat. Medium bodied, lighter in carbonation."

750ml cork and cage bottle poured into a snifter

A- big pop of the cork, pours black in color with a one-finger foamy khaki head that quickly reduces to a ring around the edge

S- surprisingly plenty of barrel notes on the nose, given that it states that it's only aged for at least 3 months. Peppery wet oak, bourbon, caramel and vanilla up front, followed by molasses, brown sugar, chocolate, fudge brownies & walnuts

T- sharp oaky note up front, followed by barrel juice, caramel, vanilla and cracked pepper. Mid-palate gives notes of molasses, prunes, raisins and chocolate. The finish gives more barrel character and lingers of oak and bourbon

M- medium-heavy body with moderate-low carbonation leads to a foamy mouthfeel that turns into a creamy warming finish 

O- a solid, straight up BA RIS, no fancy extra adjuncts needed"
3945,Darkmagus82,Ivan The Terrible Imperial Stout - Barrel-Aged,4.25,"Served on tap in a snifter glass
Appearance- The beer is served a pitch black tar like color with a one finger head of brown foam. The head has a great level of retention, slowly fading over time to leave a ton of spider web lacing on the sides of the glass.
Smell – The aroma of the brew is massive of a roasted malt small that is matched by copious amount of bourbon and sweet cocoa. Along with these smells comes other notes of dark fruit of cherry and plum as well as a little bit of a molasses and light oaky aroma. The alcohol can be sensed as well leaving one with a dark and rich warming smell.
Taste – The taste begins as the nose would suggest with a huge roasted malt flavor that was backed by a large amount of sweeter cocoa. Right from the start there is a rather strong showing of bourbon with some nice oaky notes. The bourbon grows stronger and stronger as the taste advances, being joined by some light vanilla and molasses flavors. Toward the end the booziness starts creeping its way in, with it matching the increase in the bourbon rather nicely. Some flavors of char and smoke develop at the very end, and with the dark, sweet, and boozy tastes, one is left with a very satisfyingly warming flavor to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is thick and robust with a lower carbonation level. For the big dark, sweet, and boozy tastes the feel is fantastic coating the mouth in all the rich flavors and making this one slow sipping warmer.
Overall – A very tasty and bourbon barrel flavored ale. Quite robust and warming!!"
3946,superspak,Ivan The Terrible Imperial Stout - Barrel-Aged,4.2,"8500th review! 750 ml bottle into snifter, 2015 vintage. Bottle #2566/3000. Pours opaque dark brown/black color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense and rocky khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice dense foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla, bourbon, coconut, oak char, roasted nuts, toasted biscuit, and dark bread/crust; with lighter notes of molasses, licorice, raisin, prune, cherry, fig, date, smoke, leather, tobacco, herbal, grass, peppercorn, pine, and yeast/roast/toast/oak earthiness. Slight booze in the aromas as it warms, but not overwhelming. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/black/roast/bready malts, bourbon barrels, and light-moderate fruity yeast/earthy hop notes; with great strength. Taste of big milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla, bourbon, coconut, oak char, roasted nuts, toasted biscuit, and dark bread/crust; with lighter notes of molasses, licorice, raisin, prune, cherry, fig, date, smoke, leather, tobacco, herbal, grass, peppercorn, pine, and yeast/roast/toast/oak earthiness. Light-moderate pine, herbal, grassy, peppery, roast, charred bitterness; and bourbon/oak tannin spiciness on the finish. Lingering notes of milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla, bourbon, coconut, oak char, roasted nuts, toasted biscuit, dark bread/crust, molasses, licorice, dark fruit, smoke, leather, tobacco, herbal, grass, peppercorn, pine, and yeast/roast/toast/oak earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/black/roast/bready malts, bourbon barrels, and light-moderate fruity yeast/earthy hop flavors; with a great roast/hop bitter/sweet and bourbon/oak spiciness balance; with no cloying, acrid, astringent flavors after the finish. Light-moderate increasing dryness from lingering hop/char bitterness and bourbon/oak tannin spiciness. Medium carbonation and medium-full body; with a very smooth, creamy/silky/bready, and fairly sticky/chalky/tannic mouthfeel that is great. Mild increasing warmth of 11.9%, with minimal lingering barrel booze after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic barrel aged Russian imperial stout. All around fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/black/roast/bready malts, bourbon barrels, and light-moderate fruity yeast/earthy hop flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to sip on for the big ABV, with the mellowly bitter/tannic/drying finish. Fantastic balance between rich malt complexity and bourbon barrel presence/integration; with balancing earthy hops and restrained fruity yeast. Light residual sweetness with lingering bitter/tannic dryness. A highly enjoyable offering, and spot on style example. A lot more charred/tannic barrel presence than I expected, but it doesn't get overly boozy/drying."
3947,Cwrw,Grande Cuvée Porter Baltique,4.25,"Pours out a fairly jet black, viscous and luscious. Large mocha coloured head. Looks beautiful.

First aroma is chocolate raisins, with some prunes/dates, honey and a slight hint of coffee and caramel. Big on raisins and chocolate. Sweet, but not cloying. Hits all the right notes. 

Taste is more of the same, and the mouthfeel is very smooth, with almost no hints of alcohol in the finish. Doesn't taste like a 10 percenter at all. Plenty of chocolate, raisins, a bit of vanilla, maybe even a little cherry in there. Really, really nice blend of flavours. The body is a perhaps a little thinner than I would have expected, but it's a minor gripe for such a flavourful, smooth porter.

4.25 all round. Great beer."
3948,stortore,Grande Cuvée Porter Baltique,4.24,"750 ml bottle into a snifter. 2022 edition. Had 10/3/23.

Pours a mostly opaque dark cola color, with a quarter inch foamy head and light foamy lacing. Aromas of malt, vanilla, coffee, some molasses, light chocolate. Smells herbal and a little smoky. Flavors of chocolate, coffee, malt, some molasses, light plum. Tastes somewhat herbal and there’s a light sweet note when warmed. Smooth, a very good fuller body, well carbonated. 

Really enjoyed this. Big chocolate and coffee notes, with solid aromas and flavors overall. Well worth a purchase."
3949,Sigmund,Grande Cuvée Porter Baltique,2.8,"July 2016: RBESG 2016 in Barcelona. On tap at NaparBCN. Nearly black colour. Sweetish aroma of malts and molasses. The molasses flavour was WAY too sweet for me - at least in a setting like this, a multiple beers tasting."
3950,GuyFawkes,Grande Cuvée Porter Baltique,4.49,"Undated bottle; drank 8/27/23 @ the Yarchives. 

Black/brown appearance. 

A rough pour yielded a nice, noisy tan head; decent lacing remained. 

Fresh earth, dark chocolate & faintly tart plum notes in the nose. 

Creamy medium thick mouthfeel. 

Dark chocolate, burnt caramel. mild fresh earth & faint tart plum flavors. Kind of a stunner. Even better on draft."
3951,DanfromVan,Grande Cuvée Porter Baltique,4.01,"750 ml caged bottle with a new label dated 06/10/22. Deep rich mahogany look, less than a fingers worth of head. A tad sweeter than I would like, but on point with rich flavour, Expands in flavour a bit when it warms up. 
Feels perfect in the mouth, goes down easy. Slight bitterness see saws between ok and then being overpowered by sweetness. I'll probably try another bottle for scientific purposes. Pricey."
3952,scott451,Grande Cuvée Porter Baltique,4.14,"Production date 06/10/22. Poured a 750ml caged and corked bottle into a pint glass. A one finger tan head on black, The head diminished to a ring shortly.
Coffee and cocoa smells.
Very smooth. Sticky. Roasted malts. cocoa. ABV is well hidden. Molasses, smoke. Lots in there. A very mild hop finish.
Medium body and low carbonation.
Top quality. A rare and interesting style."
3953,HarlotBronte,Grande Cuvée Porter Baltique,3.46,"L: Almost black with a 2 finger brown head

S: Bourbon, chocolate, smoke, a bit of ethanol 

T: Smoked malt, coffee, sweet bourbon. Ethanol a bit too much for my liking and masks the good flavors. 

F: Round and smooth 

O: This would probably be more enjoyable at 9% where the chocolate/coffee wouldn’t be masked by alcohol."
3954,donzilake,Grande Cuvée Porter Baltique,4.4,"Smooth, sweet, weak carbonation, medium plus body, well-hidden alcohol."
3955,mactrail,Grande Cuvée Porter Baltique,3.4,"Very dark brown with modest foam in the Orval chalice. Burnt sugar taste that does not quit. And licorice, molasses, brown sugar. Even a touch of maple syrup. You could add every other sweet thing from figs to fruitcake. It just doesn't quit even after you're ready for something else, like water would be my next drink.

Monstrous big and sweet malt monster. The aftertaste has a hint of sourish burnt malt but not much bitterness. A few sips are quite interesting, but I liked it better mixed with a ""normal"" stout. From the 750 ml bottle purchased at Elizabeth Station in Bellingham."
3956,backblast,Grande Cuvée Porter Baltique,4.5,"Poured almost black in color with a thin tan head that dissipated quickly and no lacing.

Tastes of heavy charred malts mixed with dark fruit, tobacco and candied molasses. Not too sweet aftertaste and lingers wonderfully. Med body and low carbonation make this a top pick."
3957,Greywulfken,Grande Cuvée Porter Baltique,4,"It's a sweet one, and leaning into imperial stout territory with a big, rounded feel and sticky, full body... Rich with lotsa chocolate syrup, and enough bitter, drier espresso to pull the sweetness back and keep it from being cloying; a hint of smoke..."
3958,AzfromOz,Alpha King,4.4,"From my review in NBW 138:

Hello all! Let's get this new beer weekend started, shall we?

This one is Three Floyds Alpha King, sent to me by the inestimable @TurkeysDrinkBeer many moons ago, and one that has been begging me to drink it for some time now...

So, onto the review!

....


This beer has sat in my fridge for six months. It came to me, pride beating in simmering waves from its aluminium chest, across the continental USA, leaping the Pacific Ocean and docking, prouder than John Holmes in a ruler factory, at the back of my fridge.

Since that time it has mocked me. Dared me to drink, to partake of its malty, dank body. But I have been iron of will and clear of mind. Other beers have begged attention, required consumption or perched, testily, at the edge of my fridge. This one has waited, and I have been strong.

Today, though. Today is dawned, bright, clear and autumnal. The air is crisper than it should be. Autumn has slid sneakily to my house, bringing weather not yet welcome for months. It is cool, but I wear shorts in stubborn refusal to bow to sensibility. It makes me angry. I am stubborn, and I am steadfast. But as afternoon breaks I am wroth, and this beer is front and centre.

Angrily I pour. This beer has mocked me, but now I call the shots. In response, it flares its fluffy white warning clouds at me. Unperturbed I sit and wait, still and at one with time. 'Ere long it subsides. Meekly, it exposes its dark, caramel-amber coat, easel to its thin, off-white head. Moderate carbonation follows but, King of my liquid domain, I barely acknowledge the elemental offering of carbon and oxygen. No ritual obeisance will slake my thirst. [L: 4.25]

I offer my nose as the beer, unbowed by curt dismissal of its visual defences, throws rich, chewy caramel notes at me. I rebuff the scent, but It follows with a volley of umami-laced, soy background notes. I pause. Hark, my nasal messenger, do I detect the glory of the titanic pale ales of my spotted craft beer youth? My first stumble, the first scintilla of doubt. Does this bear the ghosts of the pale ales of yesteryear? If so, can I stand before its glory? [S: 4.25]

I regain my chest-forward, arrogant composure. The taste will not mirror the nose. Without a doubt, a tropical, umbrella-bedecked fruit tingle lies in ambush beneath the olfactory assault I have endured. Beer of 2023 can not follow malty talk with commensurate walk. But I am mistaken: taste mirrors the nose, with rich, tangy, chewy caramel and toffee. In backup are deep umami malt notes that envision unearthed deep soil and the bugs that huddle within. It follows with moderate, danky retronasal bitterness sitting at the back of my tongue, building and building before turning back into a long, tangy, caramel finish. This is no tropical fruit bomb! I am bereft of defence to this sorcerous beer! I twist and turn, refusing to partake, but am trapped in this beer's embrace! And it knows it. It knows, Lord it knows. I must take more. I am slave to this delicious throwback to malty pale ale goodness. [T: 4.5]

It refuses to let up. It throws a smooth and full mouthfeel at me, as though nought but an afterthought. It waves away my loving embrace of its carbonation, previously dismissed like so much unwanted chaff. This beer knows better, and it knows how to play its cards. It is harmony, yet it has broken mine. [M: 4.25]

This beer has sat in my fridge for six months, watching, waiting. It pounced when I, suffused with arrogance, sought to bring it to its barley-kissed knees. Instead, it reminded me of the power of malty, hoppy goodness. Reminded me that a whole history of beer lies unloved, forgotten in our lust for tropical, sour and pastry highs, discarded as soon as the next sacrifice kneels at the block. This beer has held its own after an improbable journey to my fridge and then beaten my senses back into shape as it taught me a lesson I should not have needed to learn, and will study for time to come. [O: 4.5]

Cheers!

3959,ChicagoMike52,Alpha King,3.91,"Another great APA from 3F. Very good in every way, especially balance between bitterness and smooth. You get them both! Great for more than one. Put it side- by-side with ZD and report back. You have a winner with either."
3960,KomodoDragon,Alpha King,4.14,"Pours block out the light dark and even.a gentle pour produces an inch of copper head. 

Nice sugary chocolate smell. Bit of burnt wood. 

Some malty sweetness on the front which builds to a mixture of toasty flavors and even a bit of nuttiness. Quite smooth and complexity of flavors grow as it warms. Alcohol is present and there is burnt flavor, maybe like a burnt marshmallow, that lingers. The beer never strays to far from its porter base. 

Very good seasonality offering."
3961,The243Club,Edmund Fitzgerald,4.35,"My first review after 2.5 years of lurking. Commercial beak: If you’re also a lurker, come on in. The water’s fine. 

Best by 7/3/24. If that means seven months old, then this tasting will short the beer a bit. 

Tulip glass. Pours black with a very slight tinge of reddish brown. One inch foamy head that disappears quickly. Light lacing. 

Smell is licorice and toasted barley. 

Taste is complex. Ripe pears, chocolate, red wine over a base of sweet toasty malt. 

Quenching at the front, then light and a bit foamy, quickly drying, ends very dry. A bit more carbonation than seems to belong here (compared to other porters). 

Very good."
3962,thin_mint,Edmund Fitzgerald,4.42,"Bottle into a pint glass

Look: Dark ruby red with a beige head. Nice lacing.
Smell: roasty malt
Taste: follows the nose. Roasted malt with mild hop bitterness. Maybe just a touch of caramel in there.
Feel: Medium bodied, light carbonation. 
Overall: I love this stuff. Looks tasty. Tastes great. This is fantastic beer."
3963,dkoehler42,Edmund Fitzgerald,4.02,"I found this Great Lakes Edmund Fitzgerald and needed to try it. It's well rated and I have a lot of hope. It's got a dark brown(ruby?) pour and an off-white head. The aroma is roasted malt and a hint of coffee. The flavor matches the aroma, and is not sweet but actually bitter. It's not an unpleasant flavor though and offers a nice alternative to the usual malty sweetness with other porters and stouts."
3964,PapaGoose03,Edmund Fitzgerald,4.28,"A bit thin on the mouthfeel, and a tiny amount of roastiness, otherwise, a nice richness to it."
3965,Mugman8,Edmund Fitzgerald,4.27,"Not usually a fan of Porters, but was searching for something new and gave this one a try....

Deep garnet hue -- almost black -- on the pour with one finger of beige head and lots of lace. Aroma of coffee, chocolate and pumpernickel bread. Taste follows aroma and is creamy, nutty and smooth. I like this beer a lot."
3966,AccipiterofBeer,Edmund Fitzgerald,3.95,"Trying this American classic for the first time.

The body is dark but has quite a bit of translucence to it. The nose is roasty with a hint of hop greenery. The taste and mouthfeel are where this porter really shine. Chocolatey, caramel, dark breads. Dark roasted coffee, Thin mouthfeel with a dry finish. Great Porter overall, definitely one of the better ones widely available in the USA."
3967,TreyIsWilson,Edmund Fitzgerald,4.23,"A - Pours deep dark brown with a large fluffy tan head. Heavy amount of soapy lacing.

S - Aroma is light. Roasted malts and black coffee.

T - The taste dark chocolate, coffee, roasted malts, caramel and a light bitter hop bite.

M - Medium body with medium carbonation. Creamy mouthfeel with a crisp dry finish.

O - Classic American porter."
3968,Porters4me,Edmund Fitzgerald,4.92,"This is by far the best American Porter I have ever had. If you haven’t tasted this exceptional porter, you definitely need to put it on your “Beers I Have to Try” list."
3969,Braunmeister_1943,Edmund Fitzgerald,4.46,"Purchased as part of a “build your own “6 pack from Wegmans in Collegeville, PA on 10/23/23.

L- Deep crimson almost black color.

S- Not much in way of aroma.

T- Tangy (in a good way), smoky, dark 
chocolate and roasted malt.

F- Moderate mouthfeel with very fine 
carbonation.

O- This is a spectacular Porter!"
3970,atigerlife,Edmund Fitzgerald,4.56,"Pours dark with a 1-finger dark brown head that dissipated rather quickly.

Aroma of dark chocolate, dark fruits.

Taste if dark fruits, dark chocolate, toasted marshmallow, cocoa, roasted malts.

Mouthfeel is medium bodied and cleansing

Overall, a wonderful and delicious porter. Perfect."
3971,ChrisMoo,Edmund Fitzgerald,4.63,I love this beer !!!!!
3972,brianstrong2,Gulden Draak,4.81,"Other than Sint Bernardus Abt 12, this is one of the best beers I have ever had. The extremely high malt content and being a deep red tripel is unique and wonderful. Highly recommend. Of note, the aroma is a bit boozier than the feel or taste."
3973,acerbictea,Gulden Draak,4.75,"Dark red fruits (apples, cranberries, plums, dates, cherry), almost a little red wine. Caramel sweetness, with just enough bitterness to keep it from being cloying. Goes down INCREDIBLY easily for its 10.5% ABV. All-around excellent."
3974,cratez,Gulden Draak,4.5,"330ml bottle from a gift pack purchased at the LCBO. Expiry date of November 7, 2025. Consumed January 6, 2024.

L: Clear, dark, ruby red hue. One finger of tan coloured foam. Several strands of lacing on the wine glass. 

S: Red apple, cherry, roasted malt. Some vinous red wine notes. Hints of caramel, dark pit fruit (plum) & toffee. 

T: Mostly follows the nose. A bit chocolatey + touch of sour cherry. 

F: Lush, silky, full bodied MF. Slightly tart upfront. Long, bittersweet, drying finish. ABV is well hidden. 

O: A first class Belgian Strong Dark Ale, with genuinely novel character thanks to the red wine yeast. One of the better examples of the style, this is a ""must-try"" in my books."
3975,Steve555,Gulden Draak,4.47,"My first dark ted tripel. Creamy tan foam on a reddish brown body. Taste is malty, sweet caramel and cranberries with some lingering bitterness. Finish is very smooth and slightly sweet with next to no booziness. The effect is a very clean sense of inebriation and the realisation you’ve drank something special."
3976,defunksta,Gulden Draak,4,"Appearance: Pours a clear, deep amber color with a massive light tan head. SRM of 19. (4.00)

Aroma: Strong aromas of rich bread, dark red fruits, some cherry and booze underneath. (4.00) 

Flavor: Strong and rich flavors of caramel mixed with dark fred fruit and Belgian spices. Plum, cherry, amber malts. Booze shows underneath and finishes sweet. (4.00) 

Feel: Heavier-bodied, strong carbonation, Warm, sweet, and shows the booze a bit. (4.00) 

Overall: Ranked #8 for a Belgian Strong Dark Ale, but on the bottle listed as a Red Tripel. It has rich caramel, red fruit, and shows the booze with a warming quality on the end. Very flavorful and the amber malt flavors emerge as it warms. Enjoying it so far. (Rating: 4.00)"
3977,Grax,Gulden Draak,4.6,"Aroma is extremely complex and enticing, with a bouquet of juicy red fruits and caramelly malt. The body delivers, with a wave of creamy, juicy red fruit followed by spice and malt. Very intense and complex mouthfeel follows, yeasty, herbaceous, and delicious. Great beer"
3978,nizzle8287,Gulden Draak,5,"Poured into a snifter at about 45F, somewhere between ruby and amber, with an off-white head with very fine bubbles that reduces to a nice film and ring around the edges of the glass. Smell is candied figs, caramel and yeast. Tastes of dried dark fruit and cotton candy, with a slight hint a hoppy bitterness. High carbonation, appropriate for the style. ABV is very hard to detect, but is all there when you stand up after finishing the glass. Overall, a spectacularly good dark triple. Just as good as Chimay blue in my opinion. Very easy to drink. I will definitely get this again!"
3979,Weisenbeer,Gulden Draak,4.53,"In a word.... Wow .... Like a desert in a glass ... I think this is a one and done, meaning have one and then you're done .... Incredibly easy to drink and super potent .. dark, malty, carmely, etc .... Much love"
3980,brianstrong2,Tripel,3.84,"Excellent beer, but I prefer darker options of Dubbels and Quads so a bit skewed here. Probably should deserve higher numbers."
3981,GreesyFizeek,Tripel,4.57,"Bottle purchased and drank at The Sovereign in Washington, DC.

This one pours a golden orange color, with a small head, and lots of lacing.

This smells like pear, banana, citrus, wheat, floral bitterness, and white pepper.

This is basically spot on for the style – not quite as heavy as the style can sometimes be, with a super clean floral and peppery bitterness on the finish, with a really pleasant fruity sweetness up front. The sweetness is subtle and lovely, and not overwhelming.

This is medium bodied, very crisp for the style, and quite drinkable.

There really aren’t many better tripels out there."
3982,BJB13,Tripel,4.27,"330 ml bottle poured into a Tulip.

Very nice glass of beer.
Hazy golden orange pour with a nice white and creamy head that persists and leaves plenty of lace. Nose is fairly strong, malty bread and baking spice, hints of honey. Tasting malty and rich but still fairly attenuated, sweet Belgian yeast esters, bread grain malt, notes of tangerine, has a bit of woody tang and hints of spice. Medium bodied with high carbonation, crisp over creamy with the creamy softness becoming more apparent as the carbonation dissipates."
3983,CantDrinkEveryBeer,Tripel,4.46,"I'm a sucker for old-school design so I love the simple, charming label. A flat color, a cheerful, cheeky monk – and who wouldn't be cheerful with a chalice full of beer? Best by date of 01-06-24. Poured into a tall goblet.

Look: Completely opaque. Beautiful burnt yellow, like the setting sun. Fine sediment floats about, slowly whirling in the intense carbonation. Dense, pillowy head with fantastic retention. Takes about five minutes for the head to start receding, and the lacings cling to the glass.

Smell: Gentle aroma. Wheat and honey. A hint of cloves.

Taste: Subtle, overall. Wildflowers, unripe tangerine, with the taste of sweet, bready malt as the base. Cloves come in as the beer is swirled by the tongue. Touch of dryness in the finish. That's the only detectable part of the ABV. The aftertaste is gentle and floral.

Feel: Super thick and smooth. Fills the mouth when held before swallowing. Sugary and sticky like cappuccino foam. 

Overall: I love a good tripel, and this is exactly that. Delicious, straightforward example of the style."
3984,orangejuiceclick,Tripel,1.95,Not for me. A little sour for a tripel imo
3985,Deano_53,Tripel,3.88,"Tasty, but not my favorite Tripel"
3986,ResearchRado,Tripel,4.43,"Appearance:
Bright golden. Sheet lacing. Opaque.

Aroma: 
Yum. Banana. Bubblegum. 

Taste:
Bubblegum. Mild clove. Some sweetness but not syrupy. 

Mouthfeel: 
Medium body. None of the sharp/metallic notes found in some tripels. Not as effervescent as some either. Wow, just reeeaaaallly unobtrusive. 

Overall: 
Yes. Easiest tripel ever. So easy going."
3987,jneedham,Tripel,5,Love this beer!
3988,Hephaistos,Tripel,4.22,"330 ml bottle at 8%. Poured at around 7 degrees celciusm in a Tongeren glass.
Highly carbonated, lovely layer of dense foam, disolving slowly.
Hazy white yellow colour. Smell, Fresh bread, yeast, caramel.
Taste, sour dough, yeast, lovely acidity. Was this beer oaked or casked?
Truely nice.
Do not let the corny label fool you, this is a very well made beer."
3989,JohnniEMc,Apocalypse Cow,4.02,"The pint can has been emptied into a clear glass liter mug. It went fairly well. Although the head is stark white and somewhat foamy, it's not expanding like some aerosol insulation. There's some malt and hops to smell, but they're muted, maybe even cluttered. There's good and bad, or at least not so good about the taste. From the onset, there's a nicely sharp hop bite. But the added lactose, however mildly dosed, makes this a little too sweet, something only rectified during the finish. This is hard to believe it couldn't be better without the milk sugar. Surprisingly, the lactose doesn't add much to the body. Yet, for those that don't want a sticky IPA, that's not a problem. There's more taste of alcohol than there is glass lacing and the head is short-lived. Not bad for a milkshake beer, but a recommended pass."
3990,dbl_delta,Apocalypse Cow,4.04,"Undated (WTF) can into pint glass. Pours a quite hazy golden orange with a big blocky head. Great lacing. Initial impression is juicy citrus, with an overarching sweetness that quickly fades to a resinous bitterness. Mouthfeel is sticky, fairly soft and smooth. Finish has a lingering spiciness that invites the next sip. Overall, a thoroughly enjoyable DIPA. It's full of contradictions, but that's what makes it interesting."
3991,Gajo74,Apocalypse Cow,3.77,"Pours a hazy orange color. A thumb length creamy head shows good retention and lacing.

Juicy aromas of tropical fruit, including mango, papaya, guava and passion fruit amidst a malt base that evokes honey and caramel. And then there is that lactose aroma, projecting its milky sweetness on the nose. 

Loads of juicy and big fruity hops flavors evoking notes of mango, papaya, passion fruit and guava. Very sweet with milky lactose creaminess and sweet alcohol spices. Tempered somewhat by a resiny bitterness as well as grassy and piney flavors. Nevertheless, this doesn’t quite feel like enough to counteract the cloying lactose sweetness. 

Full bodied with a frothy, soft and creamy mouthfeel. The carbonation was moderate to easy going. Too sweet overall with a boozy finish that makes this a bit of a chore to drink. 

I don’t like lactose in IPA and this one is my fault for not reading the info on the can before buying it. For what they were aiming for, I suppose they got it right, however, not for me."
3992,davisdahlberg6,Apocalypse Cow,4.06,"Enjoyed in a 16oz snifter on 7/28/21, canned on 1/15/2021. 
A: Pours a golden orang color with roughly two fingers of white foam, nice lacing as the foam begins to dissipate. Translucent with some sediment floating at the bottom of the glass, but not completely opaque like some of the haze bombs. 
S: Complex nose with notes of melon and tangerine. Other citrus notes of grapefruit and orange rind are present, but certainly more bitter than juicy and sweet. Definite dank smell along with some pine and resin that are present with the caramel hops. Nose is pleasant but nothing to write home about
T: Bitter hops flare up in the beginning and are a bit overwhelming with little to no support from everything else. Pine and resin are present with some grapefruit and orange, bitterness is fairly well balanced by the malty sweetness, but the malty sweetness is a bit overwhelming making me think this beer is less than fresh. 
F: This IPA is almost chewy and is just very full and a bit too much for my liking. A bit too much carbonation as well. Ultimately its still fairly smooth and the 8.6% abv is well hidden but whether it’s the character of the beer or the fact that it has been in the fridge a little too long it has a feel I dislike. 
Overall: Another good beer from 3 Floyd’s, but I have certainly had better from them. The hop character, is pleasant but the lactose and the heavier malt character combine to throw this beer off balance in my opinion. Glad I was able to try it, and if this was the first beer from 3 Floyd’s that I have had I would probably be all over it, but it’s a pretty average beer from them and wouldn’t go out of my way to have it again unless it was really fresh."

Taste similar to the nose, rich, oily thick but not cloying, balanced by excellent acidity, alcohol well concealed, no sign of oxidation.
Chewy, layered, refreshingly sweet dried fruited finish, feeling closer to a dessert wine.

Black body, deep red wine when held up to the light. Loose bubbly head doesn't last long.

Aroma beyond enticing. Molasses, brown sugar, dark fruit.

On tasting, just, wow. Sweet, with raisin, plum, molasses, brown sugar, but this is not cloying at all. Incredibly smooth.

Mouth just about medium. It seems a little thinner than you would like, but I swear it gets thicker as it rolls around the tongue.

Finish is warming, not a trace of alcohol harshness. Sweet, but again, not cloying. The abv is there of course, but you really dont notice it among the flavors.

A magnificent beer, one of the best I've ever had."

S - Smells richly of brown sugar and caramel. Complex, not excessively sweet.
T - Tastes sweet and caramely in a familiar way, but complex to a point which makes it hard to describe.
F - no carbonation. Flat, substance seems to be drawn from the sweetness and the alcohol content.
- in general, when I popped this beer I didn't quite know what to expect, the flavor is amazing. This is a great aged ale and I know I will be consuming plenty of jw lee's harvest limited. What a cool concept."

T- caramel malty sweetness up front, complimented by notes of sweet sherry, red cherries, brown sugar & rye bread. The finish gives more malty sweetness and lingers of cherry and faded stale hops

M- medium body with low carbonation leads to a slick mouthfeel that turns slightly creamy into the finish"
3999,AzfromOz,Harvest Ale (Limited Edition),4.73,"Drunk overlooking the ocean on the father-in-law's deck in January 2023, after having received it way back in February 2022 from @turkeysdrinkbeer. The view and the alcohol might have gotten to me, so strap in for the review...

L: Pours a rusty orange-brown, with little to no head, but what does hang around is bright white. A slow, languorous stream of carbonation threads its way up the glass around lazy, suspended sediment. That the sediment is there at all is due to my inattention while pouring. The beer is 6 years old as I pour it and I should have been more on my game. That all said, the beer screams barleywine. It looks thick. It looks rich. It looks like it wants a fire and a pair of wolfhounds at my feet while I drink it. 

A: It smells like an old English farmhouse. There are years in the carpet, pipe tobacco in the air, coal dust by the back door, and age seeping deep into everything. There's a strong umami scent - redolent of crushed beetles, soy sauce and oxidation. There's booze and old sherry, old enough that the liquid has begun to crystalise in the bottom of the bottle. There's marmalade, thick and bursting with peel and sitting beside the jar of Marmite. This is comfort and warmth, cold nights, warm fires and old, old tweed jackets. 

T: First blush is sweet malt, quickly gaining an umami edge before the marmalade washes over the tongue. There's an earthy, woody bitterness that never stretches itself beyond mild, and stays away from anything resembling a new word hop. Booze follows, mild at first, building as it warms and then softens out. There's a whiskey note right at the end as the beer thins after the swallow and a nice warmth in the throat and stomach. Everything works in harmony. It's not as loud and proud as the nose, but it perfectly fits the aural scene, and the subtle differences and softening of the taste work brilliantly after the build-up. 

M: It's as thick as it looks in the glass. If ever a beer needed a spoon - fine old silverware, if it please m'lord - this one is it. Carbonation is an afterthought. The beer rolls over the tongue with almost no carbonic prickle and leaves only the slightest calling card on the way down. 

O: This beer is the perfect synergy of nose, tongue and eyes. It looks like a barleywine, smells like a barleywine and sure tastes like a barleywine. All of those elements build on each other, and it's the evocative nature of that relationship, the building of a sensory pyramid that far outstretches its foundations, that make this beer so good. It's important to understand this is an English barleywine - there are no screaming hops, no face-melting bitterness; instead, there is malt shoved proudly front and centre, and a nod to classic English condiments, lifestyles past and times slower. Drink this beer whenever you see it. 

Cheers!

I'm not a beer judge, so my ratings for attributes are really useless. I love it, that's all I know."
4001,DrDemento456,Harvest Ale (Limited Edition),4.2,"Bottle of 2011 vintage Pours a very deep brown some sediment floaties that settle to the bottom and just a bit of carbonation that settles to a ring. Initial smells of brandy and booze repeated smells of apple cider vinegar and some wood. Taste is much sweeter than the smell very fruity barleywine mostly apricot and stone fruit slight wood and a bready finish. Very surprised by this. Smooth ABV at 11.5% its worth sipping to unlock more subtle notes of tobacco and leather.

4004,Rug,Courage Imperial Russian Stout,3.96,"1993 vintage

Happy New Year BA!! This beer is officially 30 years old, and I can’t think of a better occasion to crack it open. I picked this one up from OEC in late 2021 who had been cellaring it since 2004, so even for being 30 years old it’s probably kept in pretty good condition over the years. Let’s see how the oldest beer I’ve ever had is

Pours still and slightly cloudy dark reddish brown, no head or lacing to be found

Honestly on smell alone, you could tell me this is only about 15 years old and I’d believe you. Definitely oxidized, but I was expecting much worse. I’m picking up on aromas of prune, burnt caramel, port wine, cacao nib, black licorice, molasses, acrid coffee, and a touch of soy sauce

It definitely shows its age much more in taste, but it's honestly better than I expected going into it and is still just as enjoyable as the aroma suggested. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting black cherry, oxidized sherry, caramel, light coffee, fig, and molasses. The swallow brings notes of black cherry, port wine, soy sauce, molasses, acrid coffee, cocoa powder, light prune, and burnt caramel

A medium body and no carbonation results in a watery yet boozy beer. Finishes mostly dry with a significant roast

I'm genuinely shocked at how much I find myself enjoying this one. I picked it up out of sheer curiosity, having a beer older than myself just seemed like a novel idea. Obviously it's well past its prime, but it still held up nicely after 30 years"

S: I read the bottle. Don’t read the bottle if you have never tried a beer but might want to review it. I have my nose in this glass searching for the purported pear notes and ignoring what I do pick up. It’s sharp and rich; good cacao, roasted malt, raisins. I can smell that 10%.
T: oh this is good. More bitterness than I expected but not in a gross IPA way. More like bakers chocolate. A little coffee - dark roast, not espresso. Raisins are present but it’s not sweet.

Bottle to snifter. 2012 vintage though I just picked this up a few weeks ago, so god knows where it has been. 

LOOK: thick black, full look, small tan head fades quickly, but reforms admirably.
AROMA: super pungent, very nice mix of cocoa, fig, dates, prunes, roasted malt, red wine.
TASTE: roasted malt comes through more here than the dark fruit notes, but they are also present.
FEEL: super smooth, a little flat, but to be expected with an 8 year old thick stout.

Very Impressed. This is a beautiful and simple beer from a time before Pastry Stouts and Hop-Bombs, and Super Sours. not to disparage those other things too much, but you have to respect getting so much flavor and mileage from a simple recipe.

L- Pours with one of the darkest heads I've seen recently. The beer is black, even held to the light no glint of underlying colouring appears. 5mm fine-bubble foam cap, holds well given the ABV%
S- A minor deep roasted note plus a hint of alcohol. Looks like it should be more pungent - maybe my nose is having an off day... 
T- Rich, deep molasses, a naked alcohol note. The finish is piquant on the palate powerful hops that have a slightly numbing impact on my tongue turbo-charged by the drying aspect of the %.
F- The first sip was quite rich, but my palate adjusted quickly. I suspect this beer is loaded with carbs as it poured so quietly (viscosity). It's big, bold, heavy and not one to be rushed - a slow sippin' beer.
O- Very well put together, it's a big beer for sure. Might suit winter better than 'flaming June', and would be an ideal candidate for sharing. Very pleasant indeed and I'd happily enjoy it again.

4028,Snowcrash000,Cuvée Delphine,3.84,"Pours a pitch-black coloration with a small, creamy head. Smells of slightly roasted, caramel malt, chocolate and hints of dark fruit and estery spice, with notes of raisin, plum and allspice. Taste follows the nose, with a good balance of slightly roasted, caramel malt chocolate, brown sugar, dark fruit and estery spice, with notes of raisin, plum and allspice, as well as hints of tobacco, licorice and vanilla. Finishes bittersweet, with a medium sweetness and some chocolate, dark fruit and licorice lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a rich body and light/medium carbonation.

I get that there's a lot of variance going on with different vintages and age of a beer like this, but it really came as a pretty big disappointment to me as it just feels like a slightly more sweet and boozy version of the base beer with very little barrel-character coming through here except perhaps for just a hint of vanilla, while also kinda lacking that roasted and bitter character that I expect from Black Albert, reinforcing to me once more that this a beer that should be consumed fresh rather than aged, with that brown/candi, sugar note being a bit much for me here especially. Overall, this makes for a nice and rich ""Royal Belgian Stout"" with a good overall balance and its own unique twist, but falls short for me when it comes to barrel character and the expectations I had of this brew.

4030,mynie,Cuvée Delphine,4.56,"Black Albert aged all fancy like, served up in a purty bottle I imported directly from Belgium.

The pour is deep black, very flat and fizz-less. 

The aroma is nowhere near as intense as I was expecting from a 13% ABV, barrel-aged stout, but this subtly allows for more depth and contemplation. You get the expected nodes of coffee and alcoholic vanilla, only here they've been expertly smoothed out, allowing deeper complexities of aged fruit and sweet brown sugar to shine through. Complex without being overwhelming. Very nicely crafted.

The flavor is likewise deep and delicate, but it doesn't come together *quite* as well. Dark chocolate and coffee up front; brown sugar, vanilla, and milk chocolate in the middle; and then a wonderfully ashen back end of charred barley, pepper yeast, and European hops."

S: Tart with black cherry, blackberry, cranberry, and caramel to molasses aromas.
T: Very tart with black cherry, vinous, and lactic acid elements competing for dominance, but all contributing to an experience akin sucking on a lemon. Complex. Hoppy component not so evident.
M: Medium bodied with strong persistence of effervescence on swirl. Saliva producing and mouth puckering.

Aroma is more sour than almost any oud bruin out there (don't mind the difference in spelling). There is a little bit of brown malt earthiness and whatnot.

Taste, plenty acidic and sour, upper echelon in those departments for this style of beer. The red grapes provide an extra mustiness and amplify the humid like presence and more for the brett notes to attach to. They aren't as funky as they are thick and gritty. Its like the dark fruit keep pinging away in the mouth feel, grape, cranberry, black cherry, plum like notes. Not anything as harsh as raisin or prune though, and not really bitter, but rather acidic. Almost no acetic acid. 

The strength is massive for style, but not nearly as hot as you might think, does a relatively good job covering it up from the senses."
4038,mkh012,Rosso E Marrone,4.33,"2016 version.

Pours deep, leathery reddish-brown with a ring of off-white lacing.

The nose is sour cherry jam and lemon. Intense. A little bit of a chocolate-covered cherry vibe as it warms and the malt character comes out.

The taste opens with big black cherry. Hints of lime and fresh cut herbs. Mild oak and breadiness in the background. Cranberry on the finish. 5/10 tartness. There's enough of an herbaceous/woody note to balance out the fruit character, but black cherry is the star of the show. 10% alcohol is almost completely hidden. I drank the whole bottle without any palate fatigue.

Overall, right up my alley. A red wine sour with a nice malt character."
4039,dcotom,Burton Baton,4.37,"Poured from 12-ounce bottle into a tulip glass. Dark copper-amber color, with orange highlights and orange-tinged white head that left some streaky lacing as it subsided. Aroma and flavor are malt forward, with notes of orange popping out. Very boozy, with some oaky barrel astringence. Also tons of hop bitterness. As it warms, notes of dried fruit and dark bread begin to emerge. I'd say this is to be enjoyed more as a fine cordial than as a beer. IOW, a slow sipper."
4040,DrOfGolf,Burton Baton,4.29,"Pours a copper color. Smells of a light vanilla, probably hops, and oak. The taste was that of a clean and crisp beer. Very tasty and delicious. The 10% ABV is hidden but effective. I like it and will definitely get more when I get the next chance."
4041,blazerkor,Burton Baton,3.94,"It smells both like wood and the bright freshness of hops with just a little bread water in the background. 

It tastes very interesting. The wood, sweetness and boozy flavor from the 10 abv remind me of whiskey... not bourbon because there's no smoke. After the whiskey you get bright hops and bitterness.

The mouthfeel is very light with just a little fizz. It finishes with an aftertaste of bitterness with breathy alcohol.

Overall it's very good. I wouldn't describe it as an IPA. It's a beer I can't really categorize. I give it a 4.9 out of 6. I think it would have received over a 5 if it hadn't come right after that insanely good stout."
4042,Dillpickle315,Burton Baton,4.31,Backlog
4043,BikeChef,Burton Baton,4.57,"Coming back to this after a long time... A real throwback to taste so much malt in a double-IPA, though I know this was a cross between a DIPA and an Old Ale. Back when DIPAs first arrived on the scene, many of them tasted this way-- like a hopped up Barleywine or Old Ale. If I close my eyes it feels like I'm back in 1999-- in a good way. Dogfish was way ahead of the curve in oak-aging a beer like this. Warming caramel and hop notes, with the alcohol well-hidden (as it should be). Hits the spot on a cold night when snow is in the forecast; masterfully done-- glad I revisited this classic."
4044,maddogruss,Burton Baton,3.7,"Had this on draft.
A: pours orange amber body with off-white head with ok retention and lacing
S: sweet, orange grapefruit smelling beer with subtle earthiness
T: sweet, grapefruit taste with a subtle earthy aftertaste; some lemon notes as well
M: medium bodied and pretty smooth
D: nice mouthfeel and tasting combo; solid drinking beer overall; pretty good beer overall"
4045,hmf05,Maharaja,4.21,"Pours a beautiful orange/gold but tons of small bits floating around. I didn't realize this sixer is nearly a year old, but the aroma is still full of orange and pine. Taste follows the nose. Very clean tasting and the alcohol is well hidden. Considering this was packaged last January I am surprised how clean this tastes. I need to pick up a fresher batch."
4046,TooManyGlasses,Maharaja,4.51,"Purchased as single at Pilgrim's Market in CdA, ID - canned May 10/23. 10.0% ABV.
Pours a chill hazed golden apricot bronze with two fingers of creamy off white/tawny tinged head.
Nose is a burst of hops - citrus/orange, piney resin, some tropical fruit, and even a bit of peach. There is a tiny bit of a soapy floral aroma and notes of caramel malt.
Taste is initially sweet citrus, mango, again some peach, with caramel malt. Resinous pine, a herbal dank and sticky bitterness slowly builds. There is almost a touch of vanilla orange creamsicle sweetness.
Full and sticky bittersweet mouthfeel with a pleasant alcoholic warmth."
4047,BeerIsGood1337,Maharaja,4.09,"Excellent imperial. Very heavily hopped. Crisp and drinkable despite the higher ABV. The hops bites like a snake as you sip it, but it quickly fades away and is replaced by a mild sweetness. There's nothing overly complex going on here. No exotic notes to speak of. It's a fairly basic imperial IPA in composition, but man is it done well. Will be buying this again, and would probably put it in my top 5 list for imperials.

A borderline world-class imperial IPA in my opinion. It's good. Give it a try. I'm always impressed with Avery beers, whether it be an IPA, a stout, or whatever else."
4048,not2quick,Maharaja,4.27,"L- Beautiful golden orange that you can barely see through. Billowy white head that is slowly dissipating. I wouldn't say turbid, but lots of small floaties 

S- piney and rosin. With some Citrus zest

T- sweet with a boozy bite. Slight bitterness that lingers on the tongue. Orange Citrus notes.

F- slick with a little chewiness. Lightly carbonated but still bright.

O- Very enjoyable for a 10% IPA. I wasn't expecting it drinking this clean."
4049,MattinHouston,Maharaja,4.36,"1/27/2023 brew date. Very drinkable double IPA. Many DIPAs at 9% or above start to taste funny, like too much sugar residue, or just bland or unbalanced in some way. This one tastes very solid. A bit piney, hoppy, bitter, like an IPA should taste. I say this is well done, and I've had most DIPAs out there. Worth the $3 a can at 10% ABV."
4050,detgfrsh,Maharaja,4.39,From a can produced 1/27/23. Amber color with an inch of foamy tan colored head. Piney hop smell. Full bodied. Big caramel malt flavor followed by dank piney hops. This thing packs a punch!
4051,dano213,Maharaja,3.71,"12oz can purchased from the fridge as a single for $3.50. Canned on 10/4/2022, which makes this one day shy of three months old.

Look: Pours a very nice copper color with a slight haze and a fluffy/rocky beige-colored head.

Smell: Strong, hoppy aromas of citrus (grapefruit), pine, and dank notes. Not much else to say. It smells like it will be a bit boozy and there are a lot of spicy hop characteristics coming through. Overall, the aromas are a bit muted.

Taste: My first impression is that this beer does taste very boozy. Up front there is a nice caramel malt backbone, which pretty quickly is overtaken by a plethora of spicy and dank hops. The finish is very bitter with tons of pine resin and some grapefruit rind and pith. It finishes on the dry side and it leaves a warming sensation in the chest.

Feel: It has a slick, oily kind of mouthfeel that is also a bit chewy. Carbonated appropriately. It's also boozy.

Overall: This is very much a West Coast style Imperial IPA. It uses predominantly old school hop varieties and its expression is very much old school. I probably had this beer many years ago and I doubt that I was able to appreciate it then. Honestly, for me it's enjoyable yet I find it to be a bit boring. It's not my favorite style of beer, but I can definitely appreciate it for what it is. It's well-made and given that it is three months old, it doesn't seem like it has suffered much due to age.

From the can/website:
The Maharaja flaunts his authority over a deranged amount of hops: tangy, vibrant, and intense along with an insane amount of malted barley – fashioning a dark amber hue and exquisite malt essence. Maharaja is derived from the sanskrit words mahat, meaning “great”, and rajan, meaning “king”. Much like its namesake, this Imperial IPA is regal, mighty, and dank. With citrusy hops and caramel toffee malts as his servants, he rules both with a heavy hand. Don't be fooled by unassuming drinkability, this beer is potent. Welcome to his kingdom!

REGAL | MIGHTY | DANK

Brewed with Rocky Mountain water, malted barley (C-120, Aromatic, 2-Row), hop varieties (Columbus, Chinook, Centennial, Simcoe), dry-hop varieties (Idaho 7, Vic Secret, Simcoe) & yeast (House Ale Strain)"
4052,MalteredBeast,Maharaja,4.22,"I used to drink this one back in 2014/15 in bombers when I could get it. I recently picked up some cans and although I enjoyed it, did not have the same reaction to what I remembered in the past. The nose on it is what really convinced me something was different. I used to be blown away by just how big and fruity the smell on it was, but the cans were muted in comparison. Still a great beer."

T- Irish brown bread (treacle notes) with fruit with all the above nose notes added, some sourish milk yeast vibe but not offensive at all.

F- Heavier side of medium but not cloying, could actually go a bit thicker but I am not complaining.

O- Overall a superb beer and one that I have scored quite high cuz I like it a lot."
4059,Brian50Oshen1,Trois Pistoles,4.42,"Amazing! The Belgian yeast is a little much on the back end.

Worthy of the Praise it gets"
4060,Mugman8,Trois Pistoles,4.42,"Opaque dark brown on the pour, with thick beige head and rings of lace. Aroma is very pleasant, spicy bread and currents.

This is a fantastic winter brew....very similar in ratings to their Fin Du Monde -- which I also like and rate very highly. 
."
4061,nasal,Trois Pistoles,4.46,"Belgian yeasts and candy sugars, like Fin du Monde, but with the added roasted and toasted malt flavors. It's possible Fin du Monde is sweeter, although I've never tried them side by side. A wonderful treat."

Look is a an opaque very dark brown. Little to no lacing. Head does not exist 

Spicy bread aroma.

Dried dark cherry, bread, raisin and Belgian yeast/spice. Slight sourness that gives the impression of cider. Mineral throughout most of tasting."
4063,dank203,Trois Pistoles,3.98,"Pours a thick brown to black, almost opaque. Thick tan head. Aroma of burnt malts, licorice, dark fruits and spices. Licorice heavy on the palate as well, with a hint of dark chocolate and raisin. Booze surprisingly well hidden. Has some bite in the finish, but smooth."
4064,JayDubTrub,Trois Pistoles,4.15,Wow. Unibroue may be the most consistently impressive brewery cranking things out at distribution level. Here in NoCal it's 20 IPAs to 1 interesting brew (aka anything other). Trios Pistoles though shocked the palate for near perfect
4065,JZH1000,Trois Pistoles,4.43,"12oz bottle, best by December 2nd 2025

On the pour just under 2 fingers of tan head formed then slowly dissipated to a fine, but thin covering on top of a very dark brown body that doesn't let light through.

The aroma on this is beautiful a dry and spicy yeast note is right on top of some roasted dark malts, that are fully fermented out. Slight banana hiding behind the hint of alcohol bite. Very yeast forward, but well balanced.

Taste is very similar to the aroma, but much more layered and complex. The banana mingles with a vanilla and clove, and there is a slight sweetness from the dark malts. This slowly shifts to an herbal hop and spice note along with some definite sweet bubblegum from the yeast in the finish.

The feel on this beer is also incredible, especially considering the ABV and how much is really going on here. Dry and easy drinking, but the flavors all blend with the malt so nicely bringing everything together in a dry velvety way, with a long, but subtle finish.

Overall this is probably the best Unibroue beer I've had, and I am thoroughly impressed through and through."

T - Tastes piney, hoppy and bitter.
F - Medium body and carbonation.
O - Delicious West Coast IPA. Not sure why I didn’t try this one sooner."
4067,Mdog,IPA,3.39,"Appearance: Gold, haze from particles, ok head, pretty good retention.

Smell: Mild pine and citrus aroma.

Taste: I think the age might be starting to hit this, a bit of sweetness then moderate citrus bitterness but feels like it's coming part with a watery body. Instead of a blended taste, tastes are kind of clashing.

Overall: This was canned 8/22/22, bought and reviewing in June 2023. Usually I don't review old beers, but the 12 pack was refrigerated at the store most of its life, and frankly, most Alesmith is pretty old around here, so it serves as a valid review in my opinion. It's not bad, I'm sure it's better when fresh."

Aroma: After pouring, I let it sit for a minute. Very piney, sweet from the malts. Hints of pineapple and citrus. 

Taste: Sweet malts up front, followed immediately by piney hops and a low to moderate bitterness. Great balance. Bitter lingers in the finish for just a bit, and then it goes clean.

Overall: This is a quality beer that stays true to the roots of real India Pale Ale. I feel like lots of care was put into brewing this, and it shows in the product. Very happy with this one."

I can’t believe that after having over 20 beers from Hoppin’ Frog that I’ve never had this OG BORIS, the basis of their entire RIS program. I’ve had many of its variants and other beers in the same family tree so it’s cool to see where it all comes from. Let’s crack it open and find out what it’s all about

Pours almost completely pitch black with a finger of creamy dark tan head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing

The nose shows a nice balance of fruity and bitter notes. I’m picking up on aromas of burnt coffee beans, black licorice, black cherry, raisin, dark toast, tobacco, vanilla bean, caramel, light molasses, and cacao nib

It’s more of the same in taste but it’s a bit smoother. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting molasses, black cherry, raisin, black licorice, leafy hops, red grape, brown sugar, toffee, and cacao nib. The swallow brings notes of burnt toast, black cherry, cacao nib, caramel, leafy hops, tobacco, molasses, red grape, and baked apple

A medium body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a slick beer. Finishes mostly dry with a balanced bitterness

More than the sum of its parts honestly. It’s just a very well done RIS"

F- Thick and creamy.....low carb.....

O- Thick enjoyable beer....bittersweet.....tastes like an RIS"
4078,LiquidAmber,B.O.R.I.S. The Crusher,4.39,"Poured into a Fremont small snifter. Pours a very dark mahogany brown, appearing opaque in the glass with a quarter finger, milk chocolate head that dissipates to patches with light lacing. Aroma of dark toasted malt, coffee, molasses, graham crackers and cocoa. Flavor is dark toasted malt with moderate char, full bodied coffee, bakers chocolate and light licorice. Smoky chocolate and coffee finish. Medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess. I've had the bigger version of this (T.O.R.I.S.) and enjoyed everything I've tried so far. This is a fine RIS with great flavor depth, nice smoky char and great coffee and chocolate. If this was available in my area, it would join other fine stouts in rotation. These guys know how to brew a stout."
4079,Scotchboy,B.O.R.I.S. The Crusher,4.12,"12oz can pours out like used motor oil at midnight; thick and viscous with a fluffy brown head. Roasty and complex nose and palate, with lots of dark, roasted malt, coffee, oatmeal, rich licorice, some molasses. Really good stuff all around."

4081,cwm51662,B.O.R.I.S. The Crusher,4.56,"This isn't so much a review as synchronicity. I had a choice at the local liquor store between this and North Coast Old Rasputin. As I sipped this, I said to myself (just prior to rating) this tastes a LOT like Old Rasputin. And when I rated it, I came up with 4.56- exactly what I rated Old Rasputin! This is a good thing, because I like a thicker, richer stout, and this qualifies. The aroma right out the can is knockout, and after the first couple sips, I doubt I could tell it from OR."

S: Light and sweet. Caramel, nuts, notes of leather and vanilla and cookie dough. Some bourbon, too. 
T: More bitter than the nose. Very roasty upfront, with leather and a bit of char, then caramel and a bit of hoppiness, finishing with coffee and dark chocolate. Notes of vanilla and cookie dough throughout. 
F: Medium bodied, silky smooth, alcohol is fairly masked. 
O: Definitely more of a RIS than an oatmeal, not that I’m disappointed at all. Would love to try the BA version."

A pleasant dessert, could do well with apple pie. It avoids being heavy handed with spice or sugar, the year and malt take the lead."

4093,MissouriMule,Christmas Ale,4.31,"Pours a dark brown with a red tinge. The head is towering, on the brown side of tan, and persistent. Expect lacing to the last.

The smell is sweet and dominated by raisin and currants. There is also some boozy spice.

The taste is mostly as billed by the brewers, but I did not get the aniseed or caramel. The taste was much more akin to a homemade cherry-cinnamon-clove liqueur I concocted last year.

The feel was a bit thin, but that may be down to the length of time I held the beer in my mouth trying to detect the elusive spice notes"
4094,brewandbbq,Christmas Ale,4.3,"750ml bottle from 2012.

Pours dark mahogany with a half-inch head of off-white. Moderate retention and lacing. Plums, dark rum, caramel apples in the nose. Medium bodied with a soft, slickish mouthfeel. Rum-soaked raisins, grape jam, boozy undertones on the palate. Finishes a bit sweet with lingering booze and candied plums."
4095,TheHammer,Christmas Ale,4.01,"Appearance: Poured with a thumb's worth of head that stayed around for quite some time and produced good lace. The body is a deep opaque brown that reveals nothing.

Smell: It needed quite a lot of warming to come out, and an abundance of fig and spice. It's good but it takes a long time to get there.

Taste: Rich fig and plum to start us off with hints of sweet toasted biscuit malt in the background that remind me of savoiardi cookies, only it asserts with allspice and cinnamon and a slightly bitter walnut note before a raisin and mild herb note rounds things out. It's very rich, and is just slightly overdoing things.

Mouthfeel: Carbonation makes this exceptionally creamy to drink, which backed by fairly solid transitioning. The aftertaste is mixed but is a bit cloyingly sweet. Still, the complaints are pretty mild in this case.

Drinkability: Body is very thick, which matches it's richness which really is what they are going for here. This is a once a year, strong, kitchen sink of a drink that teeters on the brink of being over exuberant and unbalanced. It certainly sicks around once you've had it.

Final Thoughts: If this wasn't branded as ""Christmas Ale"" I'd say as a Quad, this beer is overdone, meaning they pushed the envelope too far and was left with something that manages to stand up but feels disjointed. That said, since it is, the intent seems clear for this one. This is a once a year, drink by the fire beer you have after dinner as a replacement for desert or as a meal in itself. At 10%, your Christmas certainly won't be short on merry with this offering."
4096,Christianriveraaa,Serpent's Stout,4.02,"L: Jet black pour from a 1 pint 9 fl oz bottle into a sniffer - thick motor oil appearance. foam appeared (approx 1 fingers length). Not much lacing left behind as it dissolves.
S: Aromas of dark malt, molasses, earthy spices, chocolate, slight vanilla along with toffee. 
T: Just like the smell indicated, big on the sweet dark malts for this. Getting some chocolate, a bit of cola taste in the mix, with some molasses in there. slight coffee as well in this.
F: Heavy bodied, a good sipper. Not the easiest to drink but for the right taste buds it can be.

4098,NCSapiens,Serpent's Stout,4.36,"Fantastic stout. Heavy roasted malts is the predominant flavor, with just enough chocolate to round it out. Maybe a hint of coffee and cola. If you are looking for a stout on the toasty, charred spectrum, this is fantastic."
4099,hopsputin,Serpent's Stout,4.44,"a: silky, dark jet black color. no light penetrates. thin tan head that is no more than a film (as you'd expect from the abv)

s: loads of rich roasted malts. milk and dark chocolate. sweet licorice, molasses, toffee. a hint of vanilla and oak. earthy leather and a hint of cola. a nice mild touch of dark fruit and fig sweetness at the end. rich, decadent, and complex aroma

t: roasted malts, sweet cola, and dark chocolate. a mild hop bitterness asserts itself after that, as well as a little bit of bitterness from the roast. milk chocolate and cocoa powder follow that. molasses and faint dark fruits. leather and a little tobacco hiding out in here too.

m: full mouthfeel with moderate carbonation

o: absolutely awesome Imperial Stout. rich, complex, yet very easy to drink for 11%. this beer is an absolute treat for sure"

7.8%.
Just a totally beautiful beer from the deep garnet red colour to the amazing funky/sour nose, to the lovely flavor profile. Sour but so under control.
Great carbonation and great dying mouth feel.
I think age has done this one wonders."

Appearance: A lightly hazy deep amber red colour with a one finger beige head that dissipated quickly but settled to a thin layer while leaving some nice lacing.

Aroma: Tart, cherries, oak, maybe some mixed berries.

Taste: Sour, tart, cherries, oak and a hint of spices.

Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation.

Overall: Nice cherry flavours, slightly acidic, but not overly so."
4106,Greymane,West Coast IPA,4.5,"I remember my first Green Flash IPA was on draft at Pizzeria Paradiso off Dupont Circle in DC. It must have been around 2008, and it was at the time the best IPA I'd ever tasted. Having it to complement a hot wood-fired pizza didn't hurt either. It was the first to have the distinctive Simco grapefruit peel aroma."
4107,LesDewitt4beer,West Coast IPA,4.29,"12 oz can enjoy by date 10/24/23 into a pint glass.
L: Pours deep amber honey color with a 3/4"" crusty, frothy off white head that has VG retention, very light carbo, some sticky lacing.
S: Caramel malts, berries, citrus, pineapple, mango, fairly floral.
T: Caramelized malts, citrus, ripe orange, grapefruit, berries, melon, black tea leaves, honey, a hint of bread, has a slightly resinous finish that retains a bit of sweetness.
F: Soft, smooth med-body with a slick & glassy middle and a mellow med-long finish that is lightly drying.
O: A lovely tasting beer with excellent balance. It has a light touch of honey throughout and has a very light resinous quality. Incredibly easy drinking for its ABV. It is outstanding in its style."
4108,NeilSilber1,West Coast IPA,4.27,Pours golden yellow with white foamy cap and light notes of pine and back notes of citrus grapefruit and floral. Really nice classic IPA.
4109,TheBricenator,West Coast IPA,4.17,"Look: Ruby-red and nearly clear with a bountiful off-white head that settles to a lid, leaving good lacing behind
Aroma: Grapefruit – both white and ruby-red, pine sap and needles, a little Cannabis, wafts of berries, and some sweet onion
Taste: Pine hits hard up front and develops as citrus and some berry notes follow closely behind and weave in nicely. Fruity and lightly skunky Cannabis notes appear as the pine/citrus subsides and onion stays in the background throughout. Closes with a bite along with more pine and grapefruit
Mouthfeel: Full, lightly slick, medium-high carbonation, and moderate dryness on the finish
Overall: This is delicious stuff. This beer got me into Simcoe hops 15 years ago and I used to drink it all the time until it ceased being bottled and distributed in the state. Glad to see it still gets tapped now and then and was a nice surprise birthday gift from my boss"
4110,detgfrsh,West Coast IPA,3.93,From a can. Amber color with an inch of white foamy head. Earthy pine smell. Medium body with some stickiness. Earthy pine flavor with some grapefruit notes. Solid WCIPA.
4111,JohnniEMc,West Coast IPA,4.02,"Only photos could describe the foamy white mess that rises above the top of a clear glass liter mug. It’s that pathetic. Really, no beer pour, especially an IPA should ever have this much stark white starchy foam pretending to be a head. This is the consequence of trying to fit two twelve ounce cans' contents into the vessel. With patience, the foam recedes and there becomes almost a true beer head. Obviously, there are concerns, as big white foamy and starchy heads often lead to taste and mouthfeel disappointments. The aroma is of OK piney hoppiness; but, so far, it's looks over aroma and looks have a big negative lead. The color isn't the problem. It's a rich and bright dark amber that's close to being translucent. Actually, it's a pretty good looking brew once the head recedes. Much as expected, this is a nicely West Coast hopped rendition, without much of a malt inclusion to carry it via its body, nor to give it a counterbalance so necessary for a great IPA. The ratings here may be inconsistent, but that sums up the brew. There's good color, but bad lacing. There's a nice sharp piney hop bite, but no malt balance, nor backbone. This isn't bad and the tastes of those that want hoppiness, even at the expense of a malty presence, will like this. To taste, it's a nicely dry hopped ale. To anyone that loves a traditional IPA, the lack of barley malt in the mix will spoil this."
4112,milkshakebeersucks,West Coast IPA,4.18,"Slightly hazy, rich amber appearance with a generous, fine bubbled head that left rings of good lacing. Big time piney, resinous hop aroma, some citrus, with an initial hit of sweetness that fades after a few moments. Medium bodied with just the right amount of carbonation. The profuse amount of hops engage the palate from the start well into the lingering, long lasting finish"
4113,DavetotheB,West Coast IPA,4.3,"From a 12oz can dated 12/13/21 into a pint glass.

Pours a translucent brownish orange with about a half finger of with head (gentle pour). Ok retention and lacing.

Smells of fresh cut grass and pint. Also got a hint of marijuana.

Piney, resiny, bitter taste. 95 IBUs in their glory-Right in the wheelhouse for a WCIPA. Some malts in there as well-bit of caramel. 

Very sticky mouthfeel-full bodied. Strong bitter aftertaste. Medium carbonation.

This is a WCIPA. Hit the mark squarely. And stinking enjoyable too."
4114,kotocar,Union Jack IPA,2.95,It's too fancy. It tastes like iodine. This is the laphroaig 10 of beers. Burnt electronic taste or something off. No carbonation. Thin feel. It does sorta taste like candied fruit in the background but overall I'm not a fan. It's 7% abv and you notice it.
4115,AlvinBunk,Union Jack IPA,4.13,"Just an awesome crystal clear light yellow pour with foamy head.
Super nice pineapple, and citrus like aromas! Possibly guava like aromas - generally really nice aromas.
Very dry tasting. Almost like grapefruit peel tastes, but it is nice. Seems a tad too bitter and dry, but still nice drinking.
Feels medium to thin in the mouth.

Overall, a good quality beer from Firestone Walker."
4116,Burrocreek,Union Jack IPA,4.21,This is an ultra classic American IPA with a surprising hop balance that results in a candied pineapple and pine profile that is more than the sum of its parts. The color is an immaculate clear gold without a trace of the lazy hazy. A really wonderful effort that has stood the test of time.
4117,BubbleBobble,Union Jack IPA,4.03,"Pours a clear orange-yellow, frothy 0.5"" of head that settles to a thick collar of foam. Nose is spicy, piney, resinous hop and a fair amount of malt sweetness for balance. As it warms, some more tropical juice notes as well. Taste follows, but expresses more of the spice and resin than the tropical aspects. Finish is relatively dry with a clean and crisp mouthfeel. It's really solid and reliable."
4118,jLUNAtic88,Union Jack IPA,3.72,Had this on tap and it pours very well. Decent head retention and good lacing as you drink. Smell is barely there for an IPA but tastes great. Not too bitter and the hops really stand out. Doesn't feel too full but not light either. Perfect for a beer before dinner.
4119,ZebulonXZogg,Union Jack IPA,4.27,"Undated 12oz can, single purchase.
Hazy gold, one finger off white head leaves a nicely laced glass. Terrific aromas of pineapple, citrus and pine, buds get big citrus flavors. Excellent carbonation, medium bodied. I rarely see FW beers in my neck of the woods, Od like to try this fresh."

A - 1finger of white over a semi-cloudy body of amber; moderate visible carbonation

4122,Matt_W,Sublimely Self-Righteous Black IPA,4.47,"This is worth trying. Poured like a stout but not an overly crazy hoppiness about it. Great beer, I need to get more."
4123,spectru,Sublimely Self-Righteous Black IPA,3.34,"Coppery coffee, tan head recedes to thin cap; an unusual flavor for an IPA, interesting but not particularly appealing to me. Good mouthfeel. I don't particularly care for this beer. I'm glad I only had a single bottle."
4124,hman43,Sublimely Self-Righteous Black IPA,4.41,"Look: It pours black with a tan head. Head retention is very good. 

Smell: It has strong citrus aromas with some pine. It has some roasted elements. There are some faint dark fruit notes in the background. 

Taste: It has strong citrus and pine flavors with plenty of roast. There are some grapefruit notes with hints of dark fruits. There are hints of licorice as well. 

Feel: It has a medium full body with a nice bitter finish. It also has a creamy texture. 

Overall, this beer is pack with flavor and complex combinations of hops and malts that work well together. I love black IPA's and this is the best I've had."
4125,donspublic,Sublimely Self-Righteous Black IPA,4.29,"Poured from bottle into tulip, good 2+ finger light tan head, excellent retention and great lacing. Jet black in the glass, no light passes thru. Smells of pine, and roasted malt, haven't had these 2 together in a while. Taste is , well to hell with it, taste is great, rocking pine on the front end and then a light roasted malt comes slamming into it, each offsetting the other to where it just smooths out thru the end where there is a good firm bitterness to bring it to an end. Slight residual pine on the palate, roast has left the party. They really did a nice job with this beer, hops and roast do a great job of playing nice together

Overall, a very good beer."
4127,tone77,Sublimely Self-Righteous Black IPA,3.77,"Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of pine, roasted malts.

4128,Harrison8,Sublimely Self-Righteous Black IPA,4.13,"Pours black with a couple fingers of khaki foam. Aroma is sticky resin, with toasty and roasty malts underneath. Sticky, but dark, with earthy undertones. Flavor profile is sticky resin and mild dank hops, with roasty and toasty malts underneath. Caramel and earthy flavors build as the beer warms. It's a really sticky IPA, but with dark stout undertones. Mouth feel is medium-thick with a mild velvet, fluffy texture. Very low grit. Overall, sticky dark beer, which is always a juxtaposition, but in a favorable way. 

Served in a 15.5oz Spiegelau tulip from a 12oz bottle. Reviewed from notes."
4129,DeaconWhite82,Sublimely Self-Righteous Black IPA,4.34,"Picked up a six pack, pours almost black. Strong flavor that was great. Makes you feel great. Became my go to beer for about a month. Did my job to bring it back next year."
4130,dcotom,Flower Power,3.69,"Poured from 12-ounce bottle into a tulip glass. Hazy dark orange in color, with a substantial white head that left scads of sticky lacing as it settled. This sample was quite malt-forward, with aromas and flavors of light caramel and grain alongside the floral and tropical hop notes. Medium bodied, with a resiny and bitter finish. Overall, a very good beer."
4131,Viaduck,Flower Power,3.87,"An attractively thick head sits atop a lovely hazy orange body. Floral aroma with some honey, lemon blossoms & pine tar. Mildly sweet with a fairly bitter finish. Hoppy flavor with citrus, pear & pine tar. Nice feel. I’m not a fan of IPS’s but this one is good"
4132,BrewMaven,Flower Power,4.07,"Pours a rich gold with a rocky white two finger head. Light citrus aroma, maybe some what floral. probably has more but my nose sucks. Taste shows some citrus peel a bit of grassiness and some biscuity malt. Light/medium bodied with a dry finish and mild carbonation. Very tasty warm weather IPA. I’ll be getting this again."
4133,elNopalero,Flower Power,3.99,"Ahhhhh. I get the west coast pine and grapefruit notes, with a touch of new school floral character. Just the right bitterness to finish it off. This was a fun one."
4134,fazakas,Flower Power,5,Pleasant surprise. So good.
4135,Whyteboar,World Wide Stout,4.43,"It’s almost 5 years old so take that with the grain of salt.
Poured stout black with a short lived brown head which left no lacing.
The taste is much more dark fruit than coffee and cacao but somehow it works really, really well.
The feel is just a little less viscous than the ABV seems to require, but it does work well.
OA, it does age well and I look forward to seeing how it tastes next year."
4136,bitterandstout,World Wide Stout,3.94,"Look: as you'd expect, opaque blackish. no carbonation.
Smell: I got cherries, a little barrel and booze.
Taste: Again big bright cherry
Feel: not sticky and not thin
Overall: Glad I finally had one, but like others have mentioned so many other great Barrel Aged Stouts I probably wouldn't buy anymore. That and it's a 12oz bottle when everyone else is at least 16oz."
4137,jkblr,World Wide Stout,4.26,"12oz bottled 04/11/18 (5+ years ago) poured into a DFH signature tulip glass at 55F, no ABV indicated on bottle. The beer pours dense pitch black with no light penetration and medium brown colored head. The head recedes to a thin ring and island. Minimal lacing. The aroma is moderate in intensity featuring boozey chocolate fudge brownie, slight red berry and ashy bitterness. The taste is bittersweet roasted malt with that follows the aroma. Dark chocolate, red berries, coffee, tobacco and ash can all be found. Strongly bitter. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with just less that average carbonation and a mostly dry finish. The high ABV makes itself known in each facet of the experience, not off-putting, just reminding you what you're experiencing. Overall, very good to excellent."
4138,Oktoberfest,World Wide Stout,4.4,"15.5% abv per the bottle.

It's good, but after twenty some odd years or more the brewing world has caught up to this venerable icon. I've had innumerable giant stouts of late that are just as good or better - and command a far less dear price. What's this beer's standout feature in the year of our lord 2023? Some eldritch component that beggars belief? Tasmanian barley with tufts of Thylacine fur? A wort chiller touched by the hand of the emperor? Jeffersonian hops culled from the vines of Monticello?

So yeah, it's really good. But should 'really good' cut the mustard for DFH?"
4139,Silopanna63,World Wide Stout,5,This beer’s too thin and lightweight…
4140,wmeckley44,World Wide Stout,4.65,"Blacker than motor oil poured into a snifter. Short-lived dark brown head with minimal bubbles. Very sweet raisins and cocoa on the nose with some dark fruit and port wine notes as well. The flavor is immense and complex, spanning a sweet, stewed plum and dark chocolate on the front to a rich coffee and heavy roasted malt to a slightly hoppy, more crisp finish with a significant amount of booze. Mouthfeel is rich but not too thick, with a coating effect but not too much drying. 

For how dark and extremely strong it is, it's extremely drinkable. It's not a lager or pils, there's no way you could drink more than one of these in a week, but wow. This bottle was a treat after a long day and it is something to be savored. I wouldn't call it a thirst quencher, but you don't eat chocolate cake because you're starving."
4141,TooManyGlasses,World Wide Stout,4.57,"1000th BA review - 12 ounce bottle purchased in Redding, CA at a BevMo in August 2017. 6 ounce pour.
Pours a rich black colour with scant brown head that emerges briefly with swirling.
Aroma awakens as warms - bready malt, caramel, fudge; there is a note of raisin, brown sugar, but also a bit of char and some wafting booziness.
Taste is a bittersweet blend of cocoa, toffee, brown sugar, a hint of coffee, raisin, and bready malt with an earthy hop bite. The sweetness is accented by the distinct booziness that manages to not be overpowering (but this is a sipper).
Full rich mouthfeel - sweet but never cloying - leaving with that warming boozy after burn."
4142,Mikecap42,World Wide Stout,4.85,"A: Pours a very bark black color. The head on top is a deep brown. By the looks of it, you know it's going to be strong. 

S: The smell of this beer consists of both bourbon and coffee. The aroma lets you know that the taste will be rich.

T: Very Rich in flavor. You can taste chocolate, coffee, plum and bourbon. The beer is very rich an wonderful with it's taste. 

MF: This is a heavy full bodied beer. 

O: Excellent imperial stout. I toughly enjoyed this one."

4144,RyanK252,Hop Rod Rye,4.19,"Bottle poured into a Bear Republic Brewing Co pint glass

A: Pours copper brown amber with a frothy tan head that settles to a firm layer and laces nicely.

S: Toasty bready malt, rye spice, earthy, herbal, pine, floral notes, light citrus, faint hints of dark fruit, and a little toffee sweetness. 

T: Peppery rye right up front, toasty bready malt, spicy pine, floral notes, underlying citrus, grapefruit lemon, and orange, earthy, green herbal notes, hints of dark fruit, and toffee sweetness. 

M: Just a touch on the fuller side of medium body, moderate carbonation. Deceptively smooth for an 8%er. 

O: Could have sworn I reviewed this one at some point, but I'm glad I was able to snap some up. Definitely a piece of NorCal brewing history. Excellent Rye IPA!"
4145,ryan1788a5,Hop Rod Rye,4.11,"16oz can poured into a New Belgium globe.

A: Dark ruby red color with lighter orange hues. Super healthy head formation and retention. A solid two and a half fingers of cream-coloered head stick around for the duration and leave behind gobs of chunky lacing in a loose ring formation.

S: Juiced ruby red grapefruit, pine and resin, green and spicy hop oils. Underlying malt toastiness, sharper earthy rye spice, and a distinct crystal malt sweetness that brings a touch or berry/candy shell. Clean fermentation profile, probably chico yeast. 

T: Opens with a fat crystal malt sweetness. Caramel, toffee, and candy shell. This very quickly gives way to a drying blanket of toastiness, flashes of burnt crust, and a lot of spicy rye. Hop profile hits hard and fast with a lot of vibrant and bitter ruby red grapefruit juice. Butter line and resin too, along with an oily and green spiciness. Bitterness is quite firm. The finish dries quite a bit with long lingering rye spice, oily hop bitterness, and traces of soot. 

M: Full bodied with some chewiness and a very round and creamy malt texture. Plenty of raking hop astringency too. Ample carbonation scrubs firmly.

O: What a throwback. I do think this is the first rye IPA I ever had, circa 2008, but I can't remember ever revisiting it before today. I do miss rye beer in general, and feel like it got unfairly buried under the sea of west coast and hazy IPAs. This particular beer is considered a venerable classic within the rye sub-styles, and deservedly so. I love what they've done with the hop profile: the rye is unabashedly bold, and there's some interesting specialty malt character to round things out and create just enough balance to ground the bitterness and spiciness. Drinking it bakes me feel like I pulled something special out of the beer archives, but in this case I didn't have to blow any dust off of it because it was nice and fresh at my local packie."
4146,harrypowers,Hop Rod Rye,4.15,"Pours a hazy brown with a small head and light lacing.

Smells of malt and caramel.

Tastes of toasted semi sweet spicy malt with a slightly bitter, alcohol warm finish.

Medium body and carbonation. Lush smooth mouthfeel.

This is an excellent old-school West Coast IPA."
4147,mothmanscott,Hop Rod Rye,4.4,"From notes 12/15/12: Pours a clear hazy deep amber/light brown which clears some as it warms. As the beer settles a small amount of sediment becomes evident. The pour produces a heavy finger of frothy, variously bubbled, somewhat lasting, light tan head that leaves a thin pasty wash of lace. Aroma is hop forward earthy, floral, grapefruit, pine with a fruity hint, rye bread and rye spice. Taste is nicely balanced: earthy, grapefruit, orange zest, pine: caramel malt heavy, rye spice and a hint of chocolate. Sweet, lightly bitter finish with a caramel bitter aftertaste. The 8% ABV is well hidden with pleasant warming appearances in the finish and aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy with moderate carbonation, very smooth, creamy and rich. Very, very nice."
4148,CTHomer,Racer X Double IPA,3.96,"A: crystal clear; copper in color; 1 finger finely pored light tan head that receded to a wispy cap; nice rings of lace;

S: very ripe pineapple;

M: medium to full bodied; moderate carbonation; moderately dry finish;

O: a little too sweet for my taste;"
4149,Rapscullion,Racer X Double IPA,4.68,"On tap. Pours with a clear copper with creamy tan foam. Moderate retention, excellent lacing. 
Very malty aroma with caramel and lemon hoppy notes. 
Malt backbone carries strong grapefruit golden caramel and grahm cracker flavors running into a pleasantly bitter finish.

So nice to run into a west coast brew in the the overwhelming NEIPA market. A truly superb ale with outstanding balance. Drinks dangerously well and going back for another sip before they run out!"
4150,brewme,Racer X Double IPA,4.25,"Reminded of this beer by the How many Beers of Fame have you reviewed? post. Surprised that I had not reviewed this before, have had several times. This is a great brew, don't think that it is distributed in MA anymore?"
4151,AElfwine_Nerevar,Racer X Double IPA,4.25,"BB: 04/11/21
Consumed: 02/02/21

L: Pours a pale to medium amber with a medium chill haze. An aggressive pour yields a nice off-white 2 fingers of head. It has ok retention, but what's left is sticky and leaves nice webs of lacing as the beer recedes in the glass.

S: Citrus rind (grapefruit?), Citrus pulp (orange?), a bit of pine, and prominent caramel malt. 

T: This is a hop bomb all right! I get blood orange on the front end flowing into the mid palate where it mixes with sweet caramel malt and sweet Valencia orange. The caramel malt continues and mixes with waves of pine resin bitterness on the finish. At first blush the sweetness is being balanced very well by the bitter finish, but as the beer warms the sweetness starts to win.

F: Medium-full body with medium-light carbonation. The mouthfeel is creamy and a bit sticky with a dry finish.

O: This beer takes a bat made entirely of hops and smacks you in the face while simultaneously shanking you with a sharp malt shiv....old school to say the least. To me it is actually closer to some of the proto-NEIPAs or what we used to call East-coast IPAs; i.e. a nice strong bitterness, moderately sweet, and a nice dry finish. To me, though, this is a bit sweeter than an East-coast IPA. As the beer warms it becomes a bit more unbalanced as the sweetness starts to become more prominent in both the nose and palate. For me that detracts from the palate more so than the nose and it loses .25 to .5 in the taste column as a result. As it warms it is not as balanced as it's younger sibling. Either way, this is a great IPA and a safe harbor in a ""Locust Reign"" of NEIPAs. You should try it if you get a chance."
4152,woosterbill,Racer X Double IPA,4.59,"16oz can, best by 4/11/21, into a Gandhi-Bot tulip. 

L: Pours a clear, striking copper body beneath two fingers of dense, creamy tan foam. Moderate retention, excellent lacing. Beautifully old-school. 

S: Balanced aroma of caramel malts and citrusy hops. Simple and classic. 

T: The taste takes me straight back to my formative years as a craft beer drinker, massaging both hops and malt into a perfectly balanced, thoroughly assertive river of flavor. Grapefruit, pine, caramel, and biscuit are all present in equal measure, with everything wrapping up in a solidly bitter, resinous finish with just enough lingering caramel to keep things smooth. Delicious. 

F: On the full side of medium-bodied with ample, velvety carbonation. Sticky in a good way. 

O: Simply splendid, and not just for nostalgia’s sake. The hop/malt/alcohol balance is dialed in just right, with every component singing clearly and nothing dominating. Great stuff. Beers of Fame tick 202/250. Cheers!"
4153,Roy_Hobbs,Imperial Stout Trooper,3.45,"Canned December 14, 2017 with the bottom of the can stamped ""Vulcans 4 Life""

Ok...let's see how this ~6 year old beer has held up. Appearance wise, the answer is, quite well. Stouts almost all look the same to me, but that's not a bad thing. Deepest brown / black, but what I was pleasantly surprised with was the thick, beige head that showed good retention before settling into a permanent ring and cap. 

Aroma is a nice blend of roast and sweetness. Cocoa, roasted malts and vanilla-like aromas. Nice smelling beer. 

Taste is where the age of the beer is showing up. I think time has likely stripped away what I imagine were a more congruous set of ingredients. What's left is a little bit like bitter cocoa mixed into a thin base beer. 

Overall, this is not particularly enjoyable. I will have to try it fresh. Certainly can't blame the brewer for the fact that this languished in my cellar for way too long."
4154,ovaltine,Imperial Stout Trooper,4.27,"Pours a dark cola color and settles as black in the glass with a dense dark tan head. The nose includes a nice amount of rich cocoa, along with roasty char notes and a bit of stone fruit.

The taste is amped up, with that rich cocoa and roasty char syncing nicely with the dark cherry flavor to present a really flavorful imperial stout that improves as it warms.

The mouthfeel is a bit thinner than I’d like to see with a beer of this magnitude. Still a very nice representation of the style that I’d gladly revisit again and again."
4155,beergoot,Imperial Stout Trooper,4.34,"Jet black body, opaque; thick, frothy, light tan head. Rich, sweet aroma; dark roasted grains; cocoa and chocolate; dark roast coffee. The taste follows along with and amplifies the smell characteristics; milk chocolate and coffee; moderate bitterness throughout; mild booziness. Heavy body; smooth and glassy; silky; slight alcohol dryness offsetting the overall sweetness.

A wonderful imperial stout that delivers a lot of sensory goods.

Pouring temperature: 48 °F; canning data: LAUGH IT UP FUZZBALL 11/08/21"
4156,GlenFarclas,Imperial Stout Trooper,4.8,"Great beer. World class to be honest. All malt does the job - roasted character, big malty body, bitter but sweet, that roast malt bitterness. A lot of espresso, some mild chocolatey character. It's a great beer, it harkens to the best of the all malt stuff out there and at a really good price point."
4157,Whyteboar,Imperial Stout Trooper,4.61,"This is one of the best ad-junk free stouts I have ever had the pleasure to drink.
Poured black as the Empire’s ill will with a medium brown, short and dense head that left regular lacing.
Smelled faint to my nose, but that’s normal, what I did get was malty goodness.
The taste was excellent, full and rich in depth of malts, very little bitterness at all. So good.
The feel, ideally weighted for the style, encourages a slow pace but begs for another sip.
OA, really enjoyed this one, if you can find it, try it!"
4158,BBThunderbolt,Imperial Stout Trooper,3.58,"Thanks to Roguer for this one. 12 oz can (dated Laugh it up, fuzzball 11/8/21) Poured into 14oz teku. Poured a solid and dense black color with 3/4 inch of medium brown color that had very good retention and very light lacing.

Strong roast at the front of the nose, yet it didn't border on coffee. Solid malts, and a light bit of chocolate were behind the roast.

Similar on the tongue, with the roast coming across a bit stronger, and lingering on the finish.

The body was fairly typical for the style; smooth, even, and with a finish that started sweet, but dried out nicely.

Drinkability was good, especially on this wet, rainy, stormy, late autumn day here in the PNW.

Overall, a very well done example of the style. Would be in rotation if local to me. A must-try if you see it."
4159,jbolger,Imperial Stout Trooper,4.17,11/29/21 canned 11/10. Liked much better than the taste @ NEB. Roasted malt. Espresso. Nicely balanced. Not sweet or bitter. Go to stout.
4160,Fieceheart,Imperial Stout Trooper,3.96,"It’s a very good stout. Rich, dark, heavy. Potent."
4161,heysuz,Imperial Stout Trooper,4.25,"Brew: New England Brewing Co.– Imperial Stout Trooper

Intro: 750 mil. poured into a tulip glass. Shared with a friend. 

Appearance: Pitch black, opaque. Generous head and lacing that remained through the pour.

Smell: Rich malty aroma not cluttered by “Addjunks”. No barrel aging, just grains, and lots of them

Taste: Followed aroma. Roasted grains, maybe a hint of chocolate but no barrel, no coconut, no gummy bears. Just old school stout. Quite refreshing in today’s time

Mouthfeel: Medium mouthfeel. Leaves a slight film of aftertaste of the roasted grain.

Drink: Very enjoyable to have a change of pace from all the “Addjunks”. It’s a sipper, one that will take a session to consume.

Conclusion: I was very pleased to have the opportunity to try this one. It ticked off a top stouts list and it also ticked off a Connecticut beer. On top of that, it tasted great and didn’t leave me feeling bloated. Definitely try it if you run across it."
4162,GarrettB,Apex,3.37,"August 16th, 2016 - Bear Republic's Apex predator is a trip to Glacier National Park in the glass. It panders to the bear theme, but also offers some good citrus pine notes, plus the decidedly NOT Park-like pineapple note. I also get tastes of raw tomato and watermelon. The flavor is milder and tickler than the aroma implies, with a stickiness, some dank touches, ginger and orange candies. It's a little too sweet for me, but not far from where I'd like it to be."
4163,muchos,Apex,3.53,"From a 22 oz. bottle with no date or code.
L. Dark-orange and hazy with a mammoth off-white head which reduces to a bubbly cap in minutes.
S. Oranges and pineapple, honey and bread, apricot, nectarine, a bit dank, not bitter.
T. It tastes like it's past it's prime, but it ain't bad. Caramel, honey, woody bitterness, some grapefruit, over-ripeness.
F. Full body, a bit less than average carbonation, somewhat resinous finish.
O. The hop forward flavors and bitterness are barely a shadow of what they probably once were. Still an ok beer. Cheers!"

Feel: It has a full body with pleasant alcohol warming. 

Overall: A great combination of roasted malts and hops."
4170,kflorence,Yeti,4.48,"Date on can: 02/15/23.

Pours a clear, pitch black in color with a gorgeous two finger thick frothy, brown foam on top with excellent retention. Tons of lacing as you drink. Pretty much a perfect appearance.

Aroma is a blend of dark roast and hoppiness with notes of cacao, coffee, melon and tropical fruit. Yasss.

This is very intense stuff. Starts off with roasty malts, vanilla and a hint of sweetness. Then comes cacao, coffee, burnt caramel. The hops come in towards the middle with a ton of spice. It's an almost overpowering assault on th taste buds. I do get some pine and a hint of citrus pithe. There's also a very earthy quality on the swallow that I find a bit off-putting. Finishes extremely bitter with burnt malts and hop bitterness. This is quite strong and complex.

Mouthfeel is rather heavy as you'd expect with excellent creaminess and average, but zesty on the swallow, carbonation. Alcohol is detectable but not overbearing. This is a bit syrupy and somewhat of a palate wrecker.

Wow, this is intense stuff. I mostly like it, but I wouldn't drink more than one at a time. A sipper, for sure. Other than some off notes in the tasting profile, this is very high quality stuff. If you're a fan of Imperial Stouts this is probably a must try. Cheers!"
4171,Amanuel,Yeti,4.29,"An overall mouthy, textured beer. Coffee and a dark chocolate creme mixture comes to mind. Think chocolate Affogato. Has a bitter ending but it only lingers for a second until the sweet/tart taste of dark chocolate sets in. A very dark pour, an amazing smell. Perfect 1 finger head, but a professional did pour mine and with a stout, the 2 finger rule goes. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer for every sip it gave. On to the next one!"
4172,1BrewBacca,Yeti,4.27,Poured from a 12oz can. Almost black liquid with a light brown head. Sticky foam fingers coat the glass walls from top to bottom as you drink.

4173,puck1225,Yeti,4.44,"I am putting this beer up with Narwhal as a go to imperial stout. Surprised I had not reviewed previously. A bargain as well, six pack for about $15.

Poured from a can into a tulip glass. Oily deep dark brown color with an exquisite light brown creamy, foamy head and excellent curtain lacing. Smell and taste of dark chocolate, sweet plums, and cinnamon. Some smokey malt and vanilla. Silky smooth feel. I understand why this beer is a craft classic!"
4174,Franziskaner,Yeti,4.29,"Black and impenetrable to light. There’s a fingernail of brown around the rim and covering three quarters of the top. Heavy, soapy lacing. There’s plenty of dark, lightly roasted, lightly smoky, and a touch chocolatey malt. I’m tasting roasted barley and dark chocolate. The mouth is thick and sticky."
4175,whynot44,Yeti,4.27,"Opaque black color with some ruby highlights and a massive milk chocolate colored head with some nice lacing. 
The aroma is dark roast malt, caramel, toffee, espresso and hints of dark chocolate. 
The taste is dark sweet malt up front followed quickly by the bite of dark coffee, dark chocolate and a blast of herbal hops. This is almost taste overload, massive malt sweetness backed up with serious bitterness from both the roasted malt and major hops. 
The body is full, good level of carbonation, still smooth and drinkable but best for sipping after dinner or anytime you can just relax and enjoy something really appropriate to the name."
4176,cbuzz24,Yeti,4.53,The roastiest (?) stout I’ve ever tried. Sweetness up front gives way to awesome bitterness! Smells of nice bitter chocolate that definitely Carrie’s over to the taste. I will definitely be searching this out again!
4177,Braunmeister_1943,Yeti,4.4,Poured from a 12oz can. The color is pitch black. Moderate foamy tan head. Mild hop aroma with coffee hints. Flavor is quite hoppy. Reminds me of Victory’s “Storm King “. Nice dark chocolate flavor. Dry finish and thick mouthfeel. I’m glad I finally got around to trying this!
4178,MadMadMike,Yeti,4.37,"Pint can poured into an Avery snifter. Pours a deep brown with a fine tan head that lingers.

Taste follows; chocolate, dark coffee, and a killer late hop bite.
Full bodied, low to medium carbonation.
Overall, one of my personal favorite American Stouts. Well crafted, travels well."
4179,Micklauria1,Yeti,4.9,Great flavor (not too bitter or too sweet) and mouth feel.
4180,MattinHouston,Yeti,4.39,"Strong almost expresso bean flavor, followed by dark / slightly bitter (bakers) chocolate. Mouth feel is pretty good, a little syrupy compared to North Coast Old Rasputin - but the flavor is very similar. A bit of alcohol on the aftertaste that quicky gets overpowered by the coffee / chocolate flavor. Very solid Imperial Stout, one of the best ones I've tried, and I've tried a ton of them."
4181,Lanoke12,La Chouffe (Blonde),4.48,"Look is cloudy blonde with thick foam head. Smell is of slightly sweet Belgian ale yeast. Taste is sweet, deep and boozy. Feel is thick and full bodied. Great Belgian strong blonde ale. Highly recommend for anyone who enjoys Belgian beers."
4182,Beertsipper,La Chouffe (Blonde),4.29,"This probably the second best Belgian beer Ive had, next to Don De Dieu. This is classified as a Belgian Pale Ale, but drinks more like a Strong BPA. 16.9 oz can. Both savory and sweet at the same time. My local grocer has several 4-packs of 16.9 oz cans. I might buy all of them and cellar half for 2 years. and see what happens to the flavor profile."
4183,Bluerabbitbell,La Chouffe (Blonde),4.25,"Aroma ... coriander for sure. Caramel, apricot. Belgian essence.

Taste.... Wow! Caramely, roasty, malt in the mouth. Nicely lays heavy on the tongue. Honeysuckle. (That's s new description for Leah!)

Beautiful lacing!"
4184,MadMadMike,La Chouffe (Blonde),3.77,"33 cL bottle poured into a taster’s snifter in Toulouse, France.
Good foam. Hazyboi gold brew.
Nose reeks of banana boat sweetness and is ‘typical’, at best. 
Taste is the booger picking elfy little brother of classic Belgian ales. Belgian Lite. Way sweet and fizzy. Trying to chew my way to ‘coriander’ (cilantro.,.), but it’s a myth. No hop to speak of. Sprinkles of spice. A crumble of cracker. A little pepper note at finish.
Mouth is medium and carbonation is high.
Overall, happy this common syrupy fuzzball everyday brew is available, so people have something to compare to ‘real’ Belgian ale."

An awesome blonde"
4186,Lhammer,La Chouffe (Blonde),4.04,"When you think of a classic Belgian blond ale, this one seems to tick all the boxes. It’s well balanced. Very inoffensive. Pours a hazy golden color with a very thick and well retained white head. Smells of light banana, yeast, malt, and maybe a hint of citrus slides in on the back end. Taste is refreshing and follows along similar to the nose. A bit more of the biscuity flavor comes through along with the light malts. Really good traditional beer."

4188,mooseisloose,La Chouffe (Blonde),4,"Picked this up a while ago. Maybe a year ago. Let’s give it a whirl. Popping the cap I get nice sweet candies. Pours to a bright piss yellow with a yuuuge very lacy head. Taste is syrupy mouthfeel off the bat, followed by immediate hop bite but backed with a yuuuge complexity of sweetness backbone. The aftertaste continues sweet and tart as the bite fades. A very nice Belgian. More bitter than most which is refreshing. Also ones in arca great price point."
4189,Gatch,La Chouffe (Blonde),4.15,"From draft at Cafe Belgique in Amsterdam. Not a bad spot to first try this beer. Sweet and strong, the yeast adds some funk to the feel and finish. Classic strong blonde. Drinks too easy."

4191,Rug,Interlude,4.22,"Bottled April 2022

Yet another bottle I grabbed when me and my buddy did the cellar tour there last month. On paper, red wine barrel aging and mixed fermentation is everything I want in a Saison, but this is a style for me that needs to do a lot to impress me. That being said, I trust Allagash to deliver though, so I’m excited to try it

Pours a slightly cloudy orange gold with 2 fingers of off white head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing

There’s really not too much funk in the nose, but the earthy vibe is still keeping me intrigued. I’m picking up on aromas of bready malt, tannic red wine, wildflower honey, stone, wet hay, lemon yogurt, light earthy hops, and pear skin

It’s sharper up front in taste which I appreciate, but returns to the yeasty vibe on the back end. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting tart red grape, lemon juice, doughy malt, earthy wheat, sharp oak, honey, tart plum, and pear skin. The swallow brings notes of earthy wheat, wildflower honey, lemon yogurt, stone, wet hay, bready malt, and tannic red wine

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a tannic and beer. Finishes dry with a great balance

This is really solid stuff. It’s not quite as funky as I prefer for the stylr, but it’s close. Plus for what it is, Allagash killed it"

4194,Sigmund,Interlude,3.91,"Shared 750(?) ml corked bottle at local tasting, vintage 2007, bought at Ølbutikken or Høkeren, Copenhagen, May 2011. Ale aged in oak barrels, ABV is 9.5%. Clear orange colour, moderate white head. Aroma of brettanomyces, sour fruits and apple cider vinegar. Medium sour flavour, brettanomyces galore, woody finish, decent hops. Interesting and unusual."
4195,rodbeermunch,Interlude,3.39,"What is this, a double saison? 10.4% and a 4.24 average, this outta be interesting. 

Pours a darker color than almost any saison, guessing this took some barrel notes with it to the extent that it literally turned the saison beer darker. Or maybe its just a maltyboi. Or both. Anyways, its this mixture of dark amber and brown. Not much for head retention, maybe 1/4"" white at its peak, but really settles a lot less than that. The aroma had more of a belgian quad than it did saison vibe. But there was a bit of fruitcake like breadiness in the nose, seems this one has an ample amount of brett character/nose. 

Taste brings all the dark fruit in the world into a beer with no dark fruit, no doubt the wine barrel brings a lot of that, but also this belgian yeast that doesn't seem like a saison yeast at all (more qua, bspa or bdsa). Mouth feel has a grip load of alcohol heat to it, not something I want in a 'saison'. But this isn't much of a saison, its more like a wine barrel aged quad. Not sure I really 'get' this saison."
4196,EMV,Interlude,4.46,"2017 vintage. Poured from a Cork'n'Cage bomber into a Dogfish Head tulip

L: Cloudy pour... brown/amber color (looks like apple cider) with thin fizzy/barely there head. Modest ring of lacing.

S: Tart and fruity. Red wine and the cellar it's stored in.

T.F: Modestly tart... red wine and oak, grape must, funk, and plum. Dark fruits... leather, baking cherry, and black pepper. Medium bodied... light carbonation and sticky on the tongue. Complex... more red wine and fruit to finish.

4198,blkgeorge,Dancing Man,2.88,"I bought this amongst a bunch of imported German wheat beers. It's plain bad. Overly sweet and estery. Malt liquor wheat beer. This is what happens when you fuck up the malt bill but still sell the shit. A great wheat beer for Wisconsin drunkards that don't know any better.

For a brewery that is perceived infallible around the Midwest, this is some mediocre shit that's good enough to sell to rubes."
4199,bret27,Dancing Man,4.49,"Bottle courtesy of JohnnyHops.

Would not have guessed 7.2% either."
4200,defunksta,Dancing Man,4.01,"Appearance: Pours a clear, glowing, medium orange color with a moderate white head that sticks around. SRM of 8 (3.75)

Aroma: Strong aromas of bread and spice upfront. There is bread, cloves, and Belgian spices. Some coriander and banana before a bready and banana malt backbone. 

Flavor: Strong flavors upfront of sweet bread and bananas. There's cloves and spices. Prominent bread malts with yeast and clove spices on the finish. 

Feel: Medium to heavier bodied. Good carbonation. Finishes with cloves and banana bread that linger pleasantly. Balanced. (4.25)

Compared to Boulevard Tank 7 12/12/21: Pours a lighter and clearer color with a milder white head. More bread, banana, and clove spice. Less juicyfruit. Drinks more malty and smooth.

Compared to Weihenstephaner Hefeweizen 2/2024: Pours nearly identical, Similar aromas. More sweet orange and orange spice. Less bread spice and yeast, slightly sweeter. 

Compared to Weihenstephaner Vitus 2/2024: Pours darker, milder head. Milder aromas and flavors. Dryer and yeastier. 

Overall: A very tasty hefeweizen here. I don't get much cinnamon here. Yet, nice bready, banana, and clove spices. Yet the carbonation comes through here for a nice balanced and clean finish. I think that is what makes this beer drink so well. I enjoyed this one for sure. (Final Rating: 4.01)"
4201,chum_husk,Dancing Man,3.23,"12oz glass bottle - review from notes

This is, in my humble opinion, one of the best American brewed Hefeweizen.
I will make it to the brewery some day and have it on tap."
4203,UrbanCaveman,Dancing Man,4.61,"L: Pours a beautifully cloudy burnished amber, and even with a fairly careful pour, formed a four-finger head of dense off-white foam. Plenty of tiny bubbles visible racing from the bottom.

S: A delightful bouquet of ripe wheat, bubblegum, clove, and white grape.

T: At the risk of redundant repetition, ""delightful"" seems again apropos. Each sip opens with a lovely slurry of clove and banana flavor, with some pear and white grape notes developing as it moves across the tongue. By the swallow, some light citrusy coriander tones join in, and linger alongside the clove for the aftertaste.

F: That is as lush and pillowy as one could want a wheat beer to feel. The phrase ""cream of what"" came to mind as a descriptor for this brew's mouthfeel.

O: That is decidedly impressive for a US brewed hefe. Dan clearly picked up a trick or two during his time at Ayinger. I'll be trying to find this (and Bubbler) any time I'm able to get near Wisconsin during the brewing window."

Overall just an outstanding IPA - perfect name for a perfect beer!"
4207,Gatch,Just Outstanding IPA,4.29,"Canned 04/07/22.
A maltier and darker IPA than I expected but still delicious. I’ve never had their Citra DIPA but I imagine this is a near polar opposite. Rich, caramel malt complement the earthy hops. A nice change of pace."
4208,Thankin_Hank,Just Outstanding IPA,4.29,"Just Outstanding, canned 05/03/22 looks super good, rich, orange hazy with a big thick head, smells of fruit, citrus and malt. The taste is really nice with the apricot like flavor. Only hints of citrus and clove that finishes slightly dry and bitter. Overall a very nice IPA from California and my beloved @RaulMondesi, thanks for sharing."
4209,BEERchitect,Just Outstanding IPA,4.25,"Getting back to basics, the American IPA has never celebrated bitterness better than in its West Coast varieties. Kern River's take on the sub-style is just bitter, just dry, just clean and just refreshing. All in all, it's just outstanding!

So Just Outstanding IPA gets going with a bubbly pour of hazy golden and orange hues. As its frothy white cap tops the rim, the common but clean and sharp fragrance of citrus, botanicals, spruce and peppery hops create a nearly citronella character on the nose. Simple and sweet in its malt profile, the beer's early taste is redolent with lighter versions of caramel, honey, toasted nuttiness and crust in a slight granola kind of way.

As the hops unfold on the middle palate, the simply blossom with citrus flavor. Branch-ripe tangerine coupled with ruby red grapefruit and the brightness of lime and a juicy impression of citrus evolve. A background of pineapple and lighter mango add a rounded fruitiness to the hops for a complex and flavorful balance. As the malt influences starts to dissolve off the tongue, the juiciness of citrus fades and its bitterness begins to take its place, providing strong impressions of pine sap, fruit peels, peppery grasses and herbs and an overall botanical gin-like counterpart once the alcohol flavors arrive.

Medium bodied and trending lighter, dry, crisp and highly refreshing, the relatively error-free IPA is a remarkably brewed IPA that's a standout in a crowded IPA market. Finishing snappy and lingering with bitterness, the session concludes with a comforting hop bite."
4210,superspak,Just Outstanding IPA,4.4,"16 ounce can into plastic cup in my Orange Tustin Hotel room. Canned on 2/11/22. Pours very hazy golden amber/light orange color with a 1 finger dense and creamy off white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lasts. Dense soapy lacing down the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas and flavors of big red grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, apricot, mango, honeydew melon, passion fruit, berries, citrus peel/rind, wood, pepper, pine, wheat, bread dough, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Light-medium pine, citrus peel/rind, herbal, floral, grassy, spicy bitterness on the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-plus body. Creamy/bready malts, some sticky hops, and light resins in the mouthfeel. Soft finish with lingering resin dryness and no hop astringency. Minimal warming 6.8% or hop burn after the finish. Amazing Simcoe and Amarillo profile. Super juicy hops with some dank and earthy notes, and a soft hazy malt backbone. Loved the hop profile as expected."
4211,MutuelsMark,Just Outstanding IPA,4.37,"Very bold color, nose and flavors. Pours darker than most IPAs, with a tanned color. Head was white that disappeared into nice lacing. Nose is malty with piney. Taste bittery and lots of malt. Very nice change from the typical IPA."
4212,simonrgilbert57,Just Outstanding IPA,4.22,A very good option for a traditional American IPA. Beautiful orange body with a great head and lacing. Smell is a bit light with a hint of maltiness in the middle and citrus at the back. Taste is good albeit uneven: it packs a juicy front but dissipates quickly.

Flavors are similar- cherry, wine, oak, malt, some chocolate, light caramel. Tastes fairly sour and lightly tart. Smooth, a solid medium body, appropriately carbonated on the low side. 

Very enjoyable. Lots of cherry, more sour than expected after about five years, didn’t pick up the bourbon barrels at all. Based on the description above, I would say that some of the flavors have become less distinct."

L: light-chestnut brown color with tawny highlights; mild-moderate haze; no foam on the pour

S: tart cherry, sour brown ale maltiness, dark fruit and perfumy undertones... excellent intensity and depth

T: much of the aromas carry over onto the palate... the cherry is relatively prominent and is complimented beautifully by the wine barrel character (wood, raisin)... tart up top, lightly demerara-like malt underbelly

F: round and rolly, but buoyant... served with a healthy charge of gas, giving it more levity... a bit viscous on the edges, but remaining soft on the palate, despite some tartness causing a bit of pucker... could slug a mug

O: second time ever having this, second time on draft at Monk's... love this liquid; 3-4 sips are not enough... why oh why have bottles never been out east?... gotta get one (2098)"

4219,OldJoeHam,Dark Apparition,4.23,"Pours like a black hole. Minimal head gone quickly. Lacing is scant but there. Really don't get much nose, but that is not my strong suit so leaving it a 4. Taste is dominated by dark chocolate & coffee in a really pleasant way - no chemicals. For a reasonably high abv alcohol is very quiet - just a bit in the finish. If you were quaff stout this could be dangerous. Feel is smooth, silky not oily, carbonation stops by to say hi but doesn't intrude.

Feel is full bodied but it's not overly dense... Light carbonation.. Sleek and goes down surprisingly smooth... Nice beer... The easiest drinking 10.5% ABV stout I've ever had..."

4224,zeff80,Dark Apparition,4.33,"12oz can. Poured out an opaque, jet-black color with a good-sized, light brown head of foam. It left sticky patches of lace on the glass. It smelled of roasted malt, coffee, rich chocolate and sweet toffee. Strong roasted malt taste with coffee and sweet chocolate/toffee."
4225,KenjiN,Brewhouse Coffee Stout,4.5,"This is a black, oily-looking brew with a diminutive tan head. Wonderful toasted grain aromas in the nose. Dark-roasted coffee and bittersweet chocolate flavors dominate the palate. Creamy in texture. I look forward to having it again."
4226,AdmiralOzone,Brewhouse Coffee Stout,4.27,"Pours a clear dark brown with a massive tan head that leaves nice lacing as it falls away. Aroma is fresh roasted coffee. Flavor is coffee forward, with dark roasted malt. Feel is medium bodied with ample carbonation. Overall, this is delicious. Enuf said."
4227,MikeWard,Brewhouse Coffee Stout,4.18,"12oz can into a pint glass. Canned 11/2/20, so 2 years old.

Looks decent enough. Darkest brown body, small white head shrinks to a ring. No lacing. Some tiny dark floaties.

Nice smooth coffee aroma.

On tasting, the coffee flavor is still excellent after 2 years. Smooth, rich, warming. No roast at all.

Mouth between medium and full, finish coffee and some warming.

Overall, glad to have risked this one, coffee has either not faded much, or was phenomenal fresh. Kinda one dimensional, but a dimension I'm happy to be in right now."
4228,krh,Brewhouse Coffee Stout,4.31,"Closing out the last days of winter with this tasty coffee stout. Hits on all points, nice cold brew coffee influence, delicious taste and smell, and abv well hidden. Killer deal at $10 for 6."
4229,chum_husk,Brewhouse Coffee Stout,4.33,"12oz can

Clear cola color, the scent is boozy and distant, lots of coffee bean. Taste is so good, I'm not even a huge fan of these coffee stouts, but this is just done damn well. The hops and the dark grains and the coffee all meld into one flavor, I wasted one of these on a roast and regret it. World-class"
4230,Bshaw22,Brewhouse Coffee Stout,4.24,"Great value bang for buck. 
Coffee coffee coffee. This is a load of coffee in a beer. Not to thick. Can’t taste alcohol. 
Pretty delicious for $10 a six pack"
4231,vette2006c5r,Brewhouse Coffee Stout,4.24,"Brewhouse Coffee Stout pours an almost black color, with not much head. Aroma is fresh cold press coffee. Flavor is a nice rich sweet malty stout, with fresh cold press coffee flavors mixed in. Good body and feel. Overall, very good coffee stout, flavors blend great."
4232,hopley,The Vine,4.59,"2015 Project, drank out of a 12 oz Saurez Family stemed glass. Frigging rocked my world. Lambic and vinuous. Nice white head. Strong bouquet. Tart and acidy, but all in a good sense, maybe it was a sense of sweetness or heavy mouthfeel that eased up on any sense of harshness, but this one just worked in every sense for me. 9 years and this only improved."
4233,Sigmund,The Vine,4,"750 ml corked & caged bottle, at Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger, Norway. Golden colour, white head. Aroma of white wine, oak, brettanomyces and white wine vinegar. Sour flavour, with the same elements as the aroma. Very good beer."
4234,WillieThreebiers,The Vine,4.4,Pours a rich golden orange with an instantly vanishing head. Wine-like grape with faint citrus tail on the nose. Taste is tart citrus and white grape. Paired wonderfully with my steak. Very nice.
4235,BubbleBobble,The Vine,3.69,"2012 vintage. Good pop despite the age. Pours a golden yellow, mild visible carbonation, no head formation. Nose is grape lees and must; light oak, light cardboard. Taste is slight apricot, white white, mildly sweet. A fair amount of musty and wet paper notes, but this is a product of the age of the beer, so hard to knock it as a result. Decent amount of spice notes as well; alcohol not pronounced, but some slight warming. Little to no carb, moderately thick mouthfeel. Would love to get a fresh vintage, but this held up surprising well over the years."

4238,thehyperduck,The Vine,4.12,"750 mL corked and caged bottle received in a trade a few years ago - thanks, Farees! This is the '2012 Project' (8.85%), served slightly chilled. Reviewed from notes.

I was worried that this one might gush once the cork was popped, but it barely reacted at all. It has a hazy golden-orange colour, producing half a finger of loose, foamy white head that quickly degrades to a narrow collar of froth. The surface is otherwise bare, with little in the way of lace; looks a bit dull - maybe cellaring this was a mistake. The aroma is considerably more interesting, with leather (Brett) being the most noticeable presence; this is followed by oak tannin, grape must and a slight hint of vanilla. Not excessively complex, but it does have a pleasant funkiness to it.

Tart and funky, but with a reasonable amount of balance maintained between its disparate parts; leather and barnyard funk are noticeable right off the bat, as are notes of oak and white wine. Minor suggestions of underripe (tart) peach, lemon, acetic acidity and green apples, as well as a grainy, wheaty malt backbone. Funky, tart aftertaste with hints of sweet grape juice and mint persisting into the aftertaste. Medium-full in body, with moderate carbonation levels that impart a relatively prickly bite to its texture. A pleasure to sip, though it's of limited drinkability - and I suspect that the 8.85% is no longer an accurate measurement, based purely upon its inebriating effects.

Final Grade: 4.12, an A-. Cascade's the Vine is one hell of a durable sour: it's in shockingly good shape for something that is at least 6 or 7 years old, though I suspect it would've been better still had I not sat on it for so long. Oh well... you live, you learn, and I still thoroughly enjoyed my bottle anyhow - particularly because I haven't had the opportunity to try very many Brett beers over the last couple of years. Well worth a look if you can find it."
4239,macrosmatic,The Vine,3.97,"Thanks to eyebereej for sending this one! Reviewed from (very) long-standing notes. Marked as ""2011 Project"", enjoyed on 8/31/17. Poured from the 750mL bottle into an El Catador teku glass.

A: Mildly hazy light gold, until the last 1/8 bottle – then some yeast haze shows up. A few bubbles rise to the surface, but no real head to speak of, despite fairly active visible carbonation.

S: Lactic sourness and some barrel tannins mix with lemony citric acid, some white vinous character, and a touch of funk – musty basement and cheese.

T: A mix of lactic and mild acetic tartness. Sour grapes as well, with some definite grape skin/grape must tannins. Some oaky tannins add a bit of vanilla. Some apricot/stone fruit presence and some lemony citric acid on the tongue as well. Biscuit malty sweet, but this stays fairly mild. Some more lactic sour and dry tannins in the hang.

M: Average to just on the light side of body. Carbonation sensation on the low side, and alcohol presence seems about average - noticeable but not particularly warming.

O: Not a bad beer, and perhaps the time in the bottle has allowed some of the “standard” Cascade ""lactic bomb"" aspect to mellow somewhat. But the grapey vinous/grape must being added to the sour profile just isn’t a personal favorite to say the least. Nothing that I’d seek out again for sure. Scores given are an attempt to score to style, rather than pure personal preference; I'd estimate personal scores to be below 3.75/5."
4240,WickedBeer,The Vine,4.3,"2015 Project.

Pours a slightly hazy golden straw yellow. Small clear bubbles rise to the top, but it’s had some time to breathe on ice so the head and lace are essentially nonexistent.

The nose is consumed by musty white wine and Pinot grapes (or in this case, Gewürztraminer).. predominantly sweet, with just enough funk and oak on the back end to create a really nice profile.

Tart white grapes transform into an earthy, oak-forward sour with a sour wheat backbone. Great balance, and a low acidity leaves just enough warmth going down.

Soft, low carb contrast a sharp sourness right away. A dry mouthfeel from the tannins puts a bow on this nicely. Warm, puckering finish."
4241,dofo777,Stone IPA,4.24,"Slightly bitter at the start, but finished a bit fruity/citrus. All around a great IPA. It was refreshing from the start, matched the salty popcorn I was eating."
4242,hman43,Stone IPA,4.13,"Look: It pours golden and clear. It has a white head with excellent head retention.

Aroma: There are citrus and grapefruit aromas. 

Taste: There are strong citrus flavors with grapefruit at the forefront. There are some floral elements.

Feel: It has a medium body with a strong bitter aftertaste. 

Overall: Plenty of citrus flavors make this a classic west coast IPA."
4243,LarryV,Stone IPA,4.25,"This is one of my go to IPA's. Pours a lovely amberish color with a relatively long lasting head. Enticing hoppy aroma with a bit of graininess. I think this is a well balanced beer - it's bitter as an IPA should be, but the malt backbone is substantial enough to balance things out without being sweet or overbearing. Freshness does matter so the fresher you can get, the better. However, I've had this beer as old as 4 months and it's still decent. Stone prints a best by date on the packaging - at least on the 12 packs."
4244,OfficerVZdiver,Stone IPA,4.04,"This is one of my “go to” IPAs when I know what I’m getting is good. Love the bitterness with just a little lemon taste, but that hood feels is still there. Stone never disappoints with IPAs."
4245,farmerhank,Stone IPA,4.16,This is my go-to IPA. It has a nice strong bitterness with a good warming resin and malty flavor There is a nice lemon note in taste and smell throughout. I can take this in the can or pour in a glass. Main reason it's my go-to is it packs a nice punch for a nice price.
4246,Burrocreek,Stone IPA,4.18,"This classic American IPA starts with bready malt and a restrained note of stone fruit, then finishes with decisive bitterness. An ultra classic rarely improved upon. For a more adventurous brew, Ska’s Modus Hoperandi takes this concept further into parts unknown. For perfection, Bell’s Two Hearted Ale leans in the direction of drinkability."
4247,nasal,Stone IPA,3.87,"Plenty of bitter-acrid hops. Lovely pine-y complexity with the hops here. This is not a beer that is going for balance. Primarily bitter. Of course, it's much better than your average beer - but it's not my favorite IPA."
4248,1776Gary,Stone IPA,5,This is the best beer ever. The quintessential So-Cal IPA. Phenomenal. Perfect in every way.
4249,whitro17,Stone IPA,4.39,"Look - golden, clear, solid white head, lacing was minimal
Smell - piney, citrus, lemon peel
Taste - piney, resinous, citrus, lemon peel
Feel - medium body, moderate carbonation, piney resin bitterness lingers
Overall - I've had this many times and it's still a damn good beer. If you love west coast IPA's then you'll love this one too. Pine resin, citrus, lemon peel and good bitterness that lingers. This is the brew that put Stone on the map and kept them there for good reason. The bitterness was hitting so good tonight so I paired her up with Stone Cold Crazy by Queen."
4250,Sigmund,Double Trouble,3.68,"355 ml bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 9.4%, 86 IBUs. Surprisingly pale golden colour, probably the palest American double IPA I’ve seen. Big to moderate white head. Distinct but still relatively moderate aroma of citrussy and piney American hops, also notes of caramel and orange marmalade. The flavour is of course very hoppy from start to finish, but not really extreme. The grapefruity bitterness is partly balanced by a pronounced malty sweetness. Notes of caramel and orange marmalade again. Very bitter aftertaste."
4251,crazyspicychef,Double Trouble,4.74,"My favorite IPA.
Big grapefruit up front.
Alcohol is well hidden.
A great citrusy beer."
4252,milkshakebeersucks,Double Trouble,4.12,"Hazed, amber/gold appearance with a medium size head and decent lacing. Subtle aroma; coaxed out some tropical fruit that resembled mango. Hoppy flavor leaned more resinous than citrus and was well balanced by the modestly sweet, malty backbone. Lush aftertaste."
4253,Saluki,Orval Trappist Ale,4.58,"Beautiful long lasting head and hazy golden hue. Has delicious flavor, nutty and light malt tastes. Only complaint is it feels a little thin in the mouth, maybe that's a metallic tinge. Carries the abv, but barely. Very thirst quenching. Could drink quite a bit. Will definitely have some more, will age some now that I know the newer bottle flavor. This bottled on 3/29/23, today is 3/22/24."
4254,dofo777,Orval Trappist Ale,4.27,"Nice bottle! Pours with a huge foamy head, once you get to the beer it's nutty, dried fruit on the front, and slightly bitter on the finish, with a fizzy mouth feel. It's an experience."
4255,mrcstl,Orval Trappist Ale,5,No tasting notes since this is readily available and a beer that every beer lover should absolutely try. Always surprised this gets so many mediocre reviews and doesn’t rate higher. I love it both young and cellared for several years as it takes on more Brett character. It would be my “if you could only drink one beer for the rest of your life” beer.
4256,DrDemento456,Orval Trappist Ale,4.06,I don't know how everybody got medium carbonation on mine it's quite high every sip being bubbly and effervescent something I'm not used to in beer. Overall The taste is pretty clean grassy herbal slight hint of sweetness. Price is a bit much I think I paid about $7 for my single. Worth trying for a world-class beer but I really couldn't see buying another one Duvel to me seems like a better option higher.
4257,solisbrewmaster,Orval Trappist Ale,4.29,"Bottled in 2021 and served in a glass in 2023. The color is slight haze with The bottom yellow and as it goes up it is a light brown to copper. It has a big head that lasts - seems like ice cream.
The smell is that of belgian yeast. It is a slight spice with herbs and slight fruit. A los slight tart sour. 
The taste follows The smell and it is balanced with some hop bitterness. 
It has a light body with medium high carbonation. 
It is very refreshing - I would drink again if I can!"
4258,tenbeersbold,Orval Trappist Ale,2.84,"This is one I've gone back to over the last decade several times a year.
Various bottles at various ages.
I get that the yeast strain is rare and the taste is unique amongst Trappist beers
But I just don't get the adulation for it.
High carbonation and a metallic bitterness that's different but it just doesn't make me want to have another one.
I've really tried to love this beer but this is an outlier for me,probably the only Trappist I don't like"
4259,rapayn01,Orval Trappist Ale,4.02,"I finally had a bottle of this in May 2022. It's good -- a balanced ale with lots of carbonation. I didn't find it to have an especially ""Belgiany"" yeast flavor. I'd drink it again. The cool heavy bottle says 6.9% abv, which is apparently standard for US distribution."
4260,robwired,Orval Trappist Ale,4.6,"Bottled 07/09/2022, best by 07/09/2027.
It poured a snifter full of cloud-white foam, but gave off a spice aroma as I practiced that virtue called patience. As the foam went down and I could finally pour at least to the second pour line, the scent was tart sour.
The taste was subtle with finessed flavors: a sweetness, back notes of pepper. And hops! All in a light mouthfeel. The aftertaste was of ground cinnamon."
4261,Sigmund,OAKED Arrogant Bastard Ale,3.95,"12 fl. oz. bottle, thanks to my son Steinar. ABV is 7.2%. Cloudy dark brown colour, big and creamy tan head. Very nice aroma of fruity American hops and oak, blackcurrants, marmelade, some vinous notes too. The mouthfeel is first soft and creamy and the flavour is first fruity smooth and alluring, then a treacherous and distinct hoppy bitterness sets in, accompanied by oaky and smoky notes. Very bitter aftertaste. An ""arrogant"" beer, perhaps - but not quite as arrogant as I feared. I am worthy!"
4262,LeRose,OAKED Arrogant Bastard Ale,4.18,"Reviewed from notes.

Pours a reddish brown from the 22 ounce bottle, excellent clarity. Off white, foamy head that was generous and lasted for a time before reducing to a nice, foamy cap.

The smell is not as aggressive as anticipated. I get a sweet impression - caramel/toffee and sweet dark fruits - raisin/fig maybe date. There's enough resinous pine to give a promise of a hefty bitterness, but there are also softer floral notes, an earthiness, a very slight citrus zest. The malts weigh in with biscuits and toast. Spicy like cloves.

The taste delivers on what's promised by the smell. Caramel and toffee lead followed by sweet dark fruit. This rides on the back of the toast and biscuit flavors. Then other flavors come along - a woodiness from the oak, floral, earthy, definite citrus zest resembling orange, and big but not unpleasant sharp bitterness. No sign of the ABV whatsoever. While it could be jagged, everything comes together for a smooth experience.

Everything lingers into the aftertaste. It's got a nice, sticky feel without being overly cloying. Carbonation seems medium and appropriate for this beer. Smooth and creamy. Oddly the beer ""feels good"".

Overall, this was a smooth-drinking flavor bomb. Layered and integrated very nicely even with the substantial kick of bitterness. Well done."
4263,CarolinaCardinals,Blackout Stout,4.12,"Picked up a single from the Blue Door Bottleshop in Hendersonville 10-7-23 for $4.25. Best by 7-15-23; consumed 2-26-23.

Beer poured blackout black with a nice light tan white head.

Nose has notes of heavy roasted malts and dark chocolate.

Taste is a heavy roasted malt base that gives a nice dose of dark chocolate and coffee in my aspirations. Finishes with a nice roasty and hoppy bitterness but it is not astringent.

Mouthfeel is very nice, medium to heavy bodied and very smooth.

Overall a very enjoyable RIS. Glad to have finally tried this classic!"
4264,defunksta,Blackout Stout,4.05,"Appearance: Pours a completely dark, black color with a strong tan head. SRM of 24. (4.00)

Aroma: Strong aromas of dark chocolate, rich chocolate, coffee, cream, and roast. Rich and chocolate. (4.00)

Flavor: Strong flavors of rich chocolate some Cany sugar gives a sweet Belgian chocolate and tongue tickle in the middle, before a rich and smooth chocolate finish. Malty and sweet, but then an uprising roasted bitterness ends up lingering. (4.00)

Feel: Heavier-bodied, average to stronger carbonation. Sweet, but then also an uprising of roasted bitterness that lingers. (4.00)

Compared to Bells Expedition Stout 2/2023: Pours similar, lighter head. Similar aromas. More bittersweet chocolate and coffee roast. Less thick and heavy chocolate with complex malt flavors of bread pudding and caramel. More bitter, roasted, and dry. 

Overall: A fantastic Russian Imperial Stout. As usual Great Lakes fashion this one packs together a great array of rich chocolate flavors with a rising roasted bitterness. Balance is the name of the game here, and it does it very nicely. 9.9% makes it feel like it's lighter, but make no mistake it's still 10% and incredibly and dangerously drinkable. (Rating: 4.05)"
4265,NiceTaps,Blackout Stout,4.3,"12 ounce bottle in a fine snifter.

Toasted dark brown color with a nice 1f dark tan cap. Semitransparent. Various light lacing.

Dry barley out front. Dark chocolate and roasted coffee aromas, anise and liquor soaked dark fruit.

Belgian dark chocolate and roasted coffee flavors. The dry barley comes along.

Palate friendly smooth medium body. Dark roast and a touch of hop bitterness blend together. 

A good Xmas Eve stout pick that ends the evening nicely. All around good Imperial stout that I’ll have again."

Date: 06/11/2019
Consumed on: 17 Nov, 2022
Glass: Snifter
ABV: 9.9%
Serving Temp: 54.8 F


Look: 
Deep and opaque black with a thin tan head. The head dissipates to a ring and a thin film over most of the beer. Lacing is good.

Smell: 
Very rich dark bittersweet chocolate with some notes of dark fruits in the background. Some char (which blends into the chocolate aromas) and faint notes of espresso and black licorice. Some earthy notes are in there as well.

Taste: 
Dark malts and chocolate start things off and then the dark fruits and some molasses (like blackstrap) take over for a short time. The sip really sweetens up with perhaps some brown sugar coming thru. Then the earthy notes and the somewhat bitter char take over, which help bring back some chocolate and also some dark roasted coffee. Things finish bittersweet and roasty and somewhat dry (for an Imperial Stout). The alcohol is fairly well hidden, though not completely.

Feel: 
Smooth and creamy with some warmth from the alcohol. The body is medium. With a slight lean towards medium-full.

Overall: 
A very good (Russian) Imperial Stout. Not overly bitter for the style, this tends towards the sweeter side but not overly much. Very drinkable, and perhaps dangerously so.

This beer has aged well over the 4 years that I have had it. I think that things have smoothed out over that time and blended quite nicely. What does seem to have suffered is the head/carbonation and the body (which is a tad light for my preferences for an RIS). But that's OK. I never found this beer to be overly hoppy/bitter when fresh, so I wasn't sure how it would handle this many years. I can say that it handled that time just fine."
4267,dd53grif,Blackout Stout,4.18,Pours a black color with a minimal head that disappears quickly. Aroma of coffee and roasted malts. Taste is black coffee and roasted malts. Finish is hoppy bitterness.
4268,osuffan,Blackout Stout,1.79,Horrible stout. Smells contain malt and barley. Very little coffee or chocolate. Unless the bitterness is supposed to be the coffee and chocolate. Very unbalanced in terms of sweetness. Extremely bitter. Much better stout beers out there.
4269,Saluki,Weihenstephaner Korbinian,3.35,"Zero head retention. Nice clear dark amber color. Tastes thin, but enough to cover any abv. Probably OK for its style, just all malt. Some chocolate and coffee. Zero sweetness. Recommended by a lover of German beers who also thought the label was cool, but this proves again to never pick a pick a beer by its label."
4270,Weisenbeer,Weihenstephaner Korbinian,4.39,I usually go to this brewer for their heffewisen and they arguably make the best of that style .... I guess I shouldn't be surprised if they make a very nice dark beer as well ... Top notch and thumbs up
4271,PlutonowyManiek,Weihenstephaner Korbinian,4.01,"Dark ruby colour, clear. Beige foam, composed of small bubbles, high, characterised by a long reduction time. Gently paints on the glass.
Aroma sweet, malty, caramel, slightly roasted, with hints of marmalade, dried plums and a hint of tobacco accents. With time, aromas of fresh bread and dark chocolate emerge.
Sweet taste (caramel, marmalade) broken by a slightly roasted, ashy bitterness.
Medium saturation downwards. Texture smooth. Body high, full. Aftertaste long malty sweet with a dry roasted finish."

4275,greenjeff4141,Weihenstephaner Korbinian,4.22,"Bought in Central FL at ABC in pint bottle. Pours dark like a porter or iced coffee. Smells slightly of molasses and caramel and dried fruits like raisins or prunes. Very small head, very fine carbonation. Tastes very much like it smells. A bit of bitterness, coffee, carbonation, and finished with a little alcohol. Very easy to drink. I like it quite a bit. It's like a porter meets an IPA. That's the best way I can think of describing it."
4276,nizzle8287,Weihenstephaner Korbinian,5,"Very dark ruby to brown; almost no light gets through. Head is light tan, and stays for a minute then dissipates.
Smells of cherries, figs, caramel, vanilla, and roasted malt.
Tastes absolutely delicious, following the smell, with no off or mismatched flavors. Tastes pure and well blended. Almost like an all natural and more delicious version of Dr pepper. Like, to take all the bad stuff in Dr. Pepper (which is everything) and throw all of that out, and replace it with a beverage that is 100% natural grown and twice as delicious (Yes, I understand that this brewery has been making doppelbocks FAR longer than Dr. Pepper made it's 23 flavors soda).
Mouth feel has light carbonation, fair alcohol presence (but definitely not overbearing), yet it's full bodied from the massive malt bill.
Overall, the best doppelbock I've ever tried, and I will definitely buy more of this!
Also, I bought some Appenzeller cheese to go with this, and my GOD it was the best food-beer pairing I think I've had."

Lively pour. Pale gold and lightly hazy with a large white rocky head that goes the distance and leaves lace. Subtle nose, bright floral hops, notes of spice and bread malt. Spicy/fruity hop and clove-like yeast flavors. Assertively bitter and overall sharp, fairly dry as well. Spicy/bitter finish and aftertaste. Warming. Medium-ish body, frothy, enough carbonation to work a small finishing crisp bite. Bitterness seems to increase as I drink. Good but a bit more sharp than I would like."

4285,BillyNoonan,Houblon Chouffe,4.44,"Oof. This Chouffe packs a punch. Pours a golden amber, big soapy head. Decent carbonation with a fullish feel. Hints of wood and fruity florals on the nose, follows with hoppy goodness, botanicals as promised and possible citrus zest in the aftertaste. Complex and delicious. Love Belgian blonds but this is converting me to IPAs!"
4286,Ant777uk,Houblon Chouffe,4.86,"Reviewing again because I am bored in this shit country that is not Ukraine.

This for me is probably the best beer ever that is commercilly available. 

I spend a lot of time drinking beer. The Belgians know how to brew. And the Americans know how to add hops. This is a perfection of both and commerciallly available, definitely, unlike Carlsberg, one of the best beers in the world."

It's insane how good this is and I wish they had it out west !!! And I wish they sold it year round. I love going back east during the fall so I can get this beer!! It's just so good, and the ABV is 8% I mean come on!!"

Not syrupy but rich enough and still drinkable enough. Perfect.

Done. Do it. So great."
4289,GeorgianBayPackr,Pumpkin Ale,3.97,"Pours a copper color with thick head that dissipates, leaving a nice lacing.

Enticing aroma though. Dark fruit, molasses, think RIS light.

Mouth medium, thinner than would be preferred, finish a lasting mild roast.

Overall, ages nicely. Would be interesting to compare with a fresh bottle."

Medium body, low carbonation, leans sweet.

Went well after dinner with some dark chocolate and Mexican chocolate cookie."

4298,LeBron_James,Aphrodisiaque / Aphrodite,4.15,"This is my new favourite stout among those that I can buy in my region. At $14 for 4 bottles it's so much better than I would have expected.
The look is pretty standard for a 7% ish abv stout. Dark black with brownish head that leaves a small amount of lacing.
The smell on this beer is great I didn't have a bottle opener when I tried it for the first time so I had to whack it on the counter and when some spilled there was this huge rush of vanilla, chocolate, and beautiful malt. 
The taste does not quite follow the nose. The complex profile on the nose is lessened significantly when tasting. It is still very cool and the added flavours of vanilla and chocolate are done well enough. The vanilla comes up front but is subtle and the sweetness is balanced well by the roasted malt. The chocolate follows into the aftertaste and is again balanced well by the bitter coffee notes of the roasted malt. 
The mouthfeel is pretty good. Medium-full bodied with medium-low carbonation. Maybe a little more carbonation would be nice, but I like it.

4300,Rug,The Dissident,4.27,"Bottled 7/25/23

I’ve only had variants of The Dissident to date, this is my first time with the base beer. The marionberry and raspberry variants were both really good though, so I have high hopes for the OG. Let’s pop it open and see what’s going on

Pours a cloudy brownish orange with a finger of loose off white head that fades to a thin ring and leaves minimal lacing

The nose is quite sharp, but in no way overbearing. I’m picking up on aromas of black cherry, brown sugar, cherry pit, tart plum, red wine vinegar, toffee, light molasses, and sweet vanilla

Things are a tad smoother in taste, though with a quick hit of sharpness up front. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting black cherry, lemon juice, red wine vinegar, dark bread, brown sugar, toffee, light raisin, and dry oak. The swallow brings notes of black cherry, jammy red wine, sharp oak, brown sugar, cherry pit, old leather, light raisin, and vanilla

A light medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a crisp beer. Finishes bone dry and drinks well below its abv

Yeah, the base beer is definitely the best of the 3 I’ve had so far. It drinks remarkably easy"
4301,StJamesGate,The Dissident,4.04,"2016 version.
Leggy white front over hazy garnet; pomegranate, wine barrel, cherry stone and light cheese on the nose; cherry juice, cider, tin, vanilla, winey wood, and cotton candy finish; tart, round, sticky. 

4 4.25 4 3.75 4

There’s a good oude bruin in there somewhere but it’s buried under a ton of cherry. 
That’s good news for anyone who can’t handle the tartness, but for anyone else, there’s something getting lost. (If it was a Flanders Red, maybe I could see this much fruit…)
There’s some wood and only the vaguest funk after 7 years, and the wine serves to double up those cherries. 

Deep and fun in its own way, but just too sweet."
4302,TheBricenator,The Dissident,4.34,"*2019 Reserve with Cherries, 10.5% ABV
Look: A fairly clear and light cherry red with a minimal head that suds up quickly and rapidly dissipates to only a ring of film encircling the beer and leaving no lacing behind
Aroma: I could smell it on the pour. Tart pie cherries, oak barrels, lactic acid notes, ripe dark (Bing, etc.) cherries, wood tannins reminiscent of a Cabernet Sauvignon or similar red wine, and wafts of some funky barnyard-like notes
Taste: Ripe dark cherries hit the palate first as layers of woody oak quickly join in the mingle with the cherry. For a split second those notes hold before the quickly building acidity crescendos and as it does, wet straw, some leather, and barnyard notes become evident and hold center stage until cherries reclaim the spotlight and lead to a very tart, spritzy, and acidic finish with zero detectable alcohol heat
Mouthfeel: Light but full, very clean throughout, looks low but drinks like it’s medium to highly carbonated, and wonderfully dry on the finish
Overall: Wow, this is straight up blowing my mind right now and in a very good way. My sister-in-law gifted this gem to me for my b-day and I’d only had it one other time in my life – 2008, when these folks first made it and my palate being much more developed now, I can appreciate how good it is. It’s like a fine, bold red wine meets tart and dark cherry juice, meets Orval – super complex, lots of cherry and oak, some funk, spritzy like a champagne (though not that much so), and absolutely no way to tell that it’s 10.5% ABV. Phenomenal and highly recommended for any Oud Bruin fan out there"
4303,siskiyoucellar,The Dissident,4.36,"This is a 2016. Five full years in the cellar have worked magic with this exceptional ale. Too bad I don’t have a fresh one right now to try it against - the difference is phenomenal. Super smooth and mellow, much less sour but a bit more funky, more juicy dark fruit."
4304,kitch,The Dissident,4.04,"A 1 pint 6 fl. oz. waxed bomber, 2015 Reserve, with a best after date of 30th October 2016. Poured into a Holy Mountain tulip glass.

Appearance: A mostly clear amber brown colour with a one finger beige head that had decent retention and left some nice lacing.

Aroma: Tart, cherry, vinous, light acetone, oak, caramel notes, and a touch of vinegar.

Taste: Lightly sour and tart, cherry, red grape, plum, vinous, oak, caramel, light boozy.

Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation.

Overall: ABV was higher than expected, although the waxed bottle probably should have hinted in that direction. There was a slight boozy feel, but despite that it was still smooth, enjoyable and easy to drink."
4305,Roguer,The Dissident,4.13,"Four year old bottle.

Nearly flat beer, murky brownish color.

Wonderful nose: moderately sour, with tons of oak, vinegar, tannins, lemon, and cherry.

Flavor follows, although it shows the age and oxidation much more than the nose (surprising, perhaps, given that part of the mystique around a wax cap is that it should help prevent oxidation). Flavor profile is otherwise the same as the nose, along with notes of peach and leather.

Unbelievably drinkable for the high ABV; it drinks like a sour at 50-75% of the ABV."

F - light mouthfeel with medium carbonation
O - complex and interesting beer, very good"
4307,MikeWard,The Dissident,4.21,"500ml bottle into a tulip. 2019 reserve.

Looks interesting in the glass. Deep, deep, hazy amber body with good carbonation replenishing a creamy, foamy slightly off white head. This head persists throughout, impressive given the abv. Layers of lacing.

Aroma of tart cherry, a little wine, some wood. Manages to smell sour.

On tasting, the sour and tart notes bounce off each other, making for a pleasing blend. Cherries are evident, but not strong or luscious. A little apple at times. It's warm, but the abv seems less than advertised.

Mouth between medium and full. Finish is a mouth puckering tart and sour mix, with a cherry presence.

Overall, one of the better sours I've had. Sour and tart mix sits very nicely on this palate."
4308,LeBron_James,The Dissident,4.5,"Pours a lightish red colour with a medium tan head and left quite a bit of lacing on my glass.

Smells of cherry, oak barrel, some light ethanol, and kind of like a sour vinegar smell.

Taste follows the nose but is even better. Lots of tart cherry and general dark fruit character. Booziness is less pronounced. There's this nice light funk present from start to finish that's more toned down than the brett version but quite pleasant. Alcohol still comes through more than I'd like but It's not terrible. The tartness balances the sweetness and the malt character really ties everything together

Mouthfeel is medium-full with lots of grippy tannins. 

Edit: I came back to this a year after my first taste and, now that my palette has developed a bit, I love this one more than ever. Absolute must try! I'm surprised that I think this was worth the money since it's on the pricier side, but this is definitely going in my regular rotation."

Light bodied with moderate carbonation and a dry finish... Very nice and highly drinkable.... I would gladly enjoy a couple of these anytime I had a chance....
4312,neenerzig,IPA,4.19,"Poured out of a 12 oz. can into one of my pint glasses, this beer pours a clear, medium to dark golden color. Has a white head that's about an inch thick when first poured that settles eventually to very thick layer of surface foam, a thick ring lining the inside of the glass, and excellent lacing. Aromas of some bready malts w/ a bit of caramel, along w/ piney, floral, and citrus hop notes. Flavors of the aforementioned bready, slightly zest, malts w/ a nice bit of caramel sweetness gives way to the also aforementioned piney, floral, and citrus hop that provide the perfect amount of bitterness, While there is a good amount of malts, the hops certainly dominate the flavor profile here. Which is as it should be. Has a crisp, slightly oily, smooth, medium to full bodied mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Has a clean finish and a nice after taste. Easy to drink in the good way a well crafted IPA ought to be.

Thank you @jzeilinger"
4315,Smakawhat,IPA,3.82,"Poured from the can into a Spiegelau IPA glass. Canned August 2nd 2022. Pushing it here for freshness but at least it was in the cold case.

Beautiful looking IPA. Deep amber bodied, with crystal copper colors and light appearances of carbonation. Off white head, definitely near the khaki yellow colored realm with simple classic three to four finger height. Lots of staying power, barely budging at all with massive retention. Just a great looking bold ipa.

Unfortunately hints of classic faded hops on the nose, with a soft caramel dominating and leafy touches of herbs, if a bit small on the nose. Still there's a nice floral pungency here, if understated.

Palate seems fairly old school. Touches of leafy sage like herbal hops, with a big emphasis on tea green flavors. Finish with soft caramel and more leafy like tea flavors and mild senses of bitterness. Mild touches of pine and earth in the finish.

Decent, but I think I might have missed the boat on this one. This definitely needs a revisit from me in the fresh future cause there is some quality in here."

Chestnut brown with a half cm, bubbly head that settles as a thin & patchy surface lacing. Rich & complex smelling, there's a sweet malt base with darker fruits on top; prunes, figs & dates with some sugars & faint toffee. The taste is similarly sweet with a malty backbone, a slightly effervescent feel that has the prunes & figs from the nose alongside the toffee & bread malts & caramel with sugars, a hint of spice & yeast to finish. It's rich, balanced & well-carbonated with a good balance between the malts & the darker fruit sweetness & most of the alcohol hidden too."
4318,JonnoWillsteed,Abbaye Des Rocs [Brasserie Des Rocs Brune],4.12,"L- Deep chestnut, and has poured beyond hazy, this has small chunks floating around despite the bottle being rested for days and poured reeeally slowly - so it seems pretty major sediment is inevitable/by design. Pours with 5mm off white head, half of which still exists when I finish the glass 15mins later.
S- Milder than anticipated, some caramel and a sense of richness. I thought I got a hint of mild/sour cherry on an early sniff, but never managed to get it again.
T- There is a small dose of sourness on the front here, then the flavour opens out immediately - boom! It's big, pungent and deep. It has a sweet note (in parallel with it's overall richness), something I rarely favour but here it's balanced by the sour. It's deep well-roasted pungency make this a super winter-warmer type of beer. ps Late on I suddenly get a 'Hang on, is that a blackcurrent note coming in!?'... maybe, fleeting.
F- It's quite a mouthful, pungent, intense, more suited to colder months as a slow-sippin' winter warmer beer. All rather wonderful.
O- I think this is absolutely superb. How they balance the sweet + sour is very clever, it's so fine-tuned. Overall the whole hangs together really well; there isn't anything at all that I note that's 'wrong', or out of balance. 
Updated lable on bottle: Now entirely modern, almost a bit 'urban/gritty', a stencil/graffiti design in white black and purple.

4324,LiquidAmber,Gumballhead,4.15,"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a slightly hazy, light to medium golden amber with a two finger white head with good retention and solid lacing. Aroma of wheat, citrus hops, lemon and grapefruit. Flavor is wheat malt, citrus hops, lemon, yuzu and a touch of grapefruit; moderately bitter in the finish. Medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess. Although a weizen fan, I've usually been underwhelmed by American wheat ales. This one changes my mind. Although the wheat base is clear, its body and bittering a closer to a pale ale, and I really like the lemony hop varieties they are using. It seems like a natural thing to do considering he common addition of lemon wedges to wheat ales, and herbal hop flavors are much more interesting than a fruit wedge. The flavor is quite bright and refreshing, tasting great throughout the taste and finish. This would become a regular summer ale for me if it was available in the Northwest. I've been intrigued by the name for years and still don't know what that story is, but glad I got a chance to try it. Everything I've had from 2 Floyds has been excellent; they seem to be a world class brewery and unusual in that some of their beers have been in constant production for quite while; the industry seems to have moved on to taste of the day brewing.

Location: Munster, IN
Style: Pale Wheat Ale
A.B.V. 5.6%
Date: 15 Nov 2023
I am drinking Gumballhead today using a Weizen Glass. I served it at 42 degrees. The pour created a foamy, creamy, two-fingered, bright white head with above-average retention. The color is straw yellow with golden hues charting around S.R.M. 4. The beer is crystal clear. The dissipation left loads of lacing on the glass. The appearance is above average for this style. 
The first aromas are wheat, light citrus, light hops, and biscuity. Swirling the glass a few more times, I smell banana, yeast, grapefruit, melon, peaches, and grass. 
The flavors are wheat, lightly toasted malts, grapefruit, floral, peaches, biscuity, citrus, and grass. 
The mouthfeel is creamy, finishing smooth. The body is medium-light with medium carbonation. 
I tried to track this beer down for a while but got it after Christmas. This is one of the most refreshing Pale Wheat beers that I have consumed thus far. The hop presence gives the beer balance and depth. I seriously wish I lived closer to get a case of this for summer camping."

An easy drinking beer. Very smooth with an earthy taste mixed with an IPA style backbone. Piney, hoppy aftertaste. ABV is not noticeable.

Thin to medium consistently. Mild carbonation.

4335,JZH1000,Maudite,3.99,"12oz bottle best by February 2nd 2026

On the pour 3 fingers of fluffy off white head formed on top of a dark reddish brown, and hazy body. Over a couple minutes the head fades to a 0.5cm covering. Sporadic lacing forms.

Aroma is a bit hollow on the first impression. There is a strange almost metallic or mineralic earthiness, before a sweet caramel malt comes though and some nice Belgian yeast spiciness. There is a bit of a funk.

Flavor is very nice with a slight bitterness along with a bready pumpernickel maltiness. The spicy yeast comes in strong with cloves vanilla and cinnamon, not to mention the actual spices that were used during brewing. Then a nice fade into a mellow, sweet, and almost mulled malty finish that is slightly chocolate. The bitterness fades fast.

The feel on this beer is full, but dry, and surprisingly drinkable for the abv. The 8% still makes itself known, but in a friendly relaxing way. Super smooth and cozy. It reminds me of the holidays.

Overall this was a nice surprise. Easy drinking and mellow for this style of beer. Full flavor and cozy comforting maltiness, but no clear alcohol burn make this very nice as a beer after a long day at work."

Pours a finger of fizzy white head into my teardrop glass. Retention is average. Lacing is pretty good. Body is deep gold - nearly orange, pretty cloudy, with a good amount of nucleation when held to the light. Looks fine.

Nose has plenty of clove and banana, some bread hiding underneath, no pepper. Definitely a perceived sweetness, and it leans towards the richer, fuller side of the spectrum - almost hef territory. Smells good.

Clove is very present on the flavor. Banana, some bread. Vey yeasty, almost musty. The beer certainly isn’t as bright as most saisons. Tastes decent.

Carbonation is medium, not very high for a saison, but I don’t mind too much. Medium bodied, that malt certainly has some weight to it. Definitely some sweetness in the middle of the palate, finishes dry. Bitterness is on the lower side, but adequate. Drinks a lot heavier than most saisons, not as crisp, I guess it makes sense for a beer pushing 7%, but still. Mouthfeel is nice enough.

Drinkability is fine.

Overall not really what I want out of a saison. Not sure if it’s quite off-style, but it’s certainly more unusual."
4338,Grax,Saison Dupont,3.73,"Fruity, malty head, rather faint, some bananas and clove. Body has a spicy, herbaceous kick, followed by cloves, banana, and hefeweisen-esque sweetness. Waiting in the mouth, it develops a more creamy texture and some bitterness. Enjoyable and solid beer."
4339,Caoimhin,Saison Dupont,4.26,"Look - cloudy, effervescent, light lacing

Smell - funky wild yeast

4340,HipCzech,Saison Dupont,4.14,"Serving: 750 ml bottle (“bottled on 01 24 23”) poured into a 14 oz Rastal Teku glass.

Appearance: Hazy golden yellow with a rocky head of sudsy white bubbles and clumpy lace.

Smell: Straw, hay, black pepper, cloves and slight banana on the nose.

Taste: Straw, hop and yeast spice continue atop a clean malt base with subtle grain sweetness, refined bitterness and a crisp, dry finish.

Mouthfeel: Light body filled out by lively carbonation.

Overall: At once refreshing and drinkable while also deeply complex and characterful."
4341,Wattie83,Saison Dupont,4.44,"11.2 oz bottle poured into a chalice glass. Hazy blonde color with big white head that lasts for a while. Smell is a bit funky, hay, green apple, spicy hop. Taste is tart, fruity (apples again, pear), clove, musty. Feel is light, well carbonated, and dry in the finish. The tartness really hits in the back of your tongue. Overall, outstanding beer that is loaded with character and just hits the spot."
4342,AnyBeerULike,Saison Dupont,3.92,"Pours a slightly cloudy dark golden color. White fluffy head formation with good retention. Spicy, banana on the nose. Fruity, banana, clover taste. High carbonation mouthfeel. Great rendition of the style!"
4343,JonnoWillsteed,Obsidian Stout,4.12,"L- Pours black with a fat cocoa brown head.
S- Clear cocoa and a hint of coffee.
T- Punchy yet dry. Makes me spontaneously sneeze! :) Mercifully there is no wall of lactose coming in - which I'm so tired of in other many heftier stouts these days. Deeply roasty-toasty, charring, some more coffee notes. It's punchy yet very elegantly put together. 
F- It remains slightly to the dryer side, and I like it for that. Pretty full-on despite not having mega ABV%; ideal for slow sipping.
O- Lovely, well put together, elegant. For those who wish for a little more hop-punch that a typical Stout, whilst not getting at all shouty or out of balance. I'd happily drink it again.

4344,Franziskaner,Obsidian Stout,3.81,"Black in color with no light penetration. There’s a half inch inch of creamy brown on top. Moderate, soapy lacing is present. The aroma is of sweet black malt and black licorice. I’m tasting plum and raisins. The mouth is dry and dense."
4345,Kevin_5280,Obsidian Stout,4.39,"Poured from a 12-oz bottle to a pint glass.

Look: pours black like Guinness, about a half inch tan head. 

Smell: Coffee and chocolate more than anything else.

Taste: Follows the nose; lots of chocolate and coffee up front, with some hoppy bitterness afterwards. A really nice balance overall.

Feel: More carbonation than I expected, but a ""full"" mouthfeel overall.

Overall: A really good stout, nice to sip on a cold day. The higher abv gives it a ""warming"" sense, especially after a couple."
4346,Grax,Obsidian Stout,4.71,"Aroma is extremely enticing roasted malt and espresso with cacao, and the body delivers on that promise. A roasted punch loaded with espresso, strong cacao, very bitter and even a slight minty twinge to it on the back end. Probably the best straightforward stout I've had."
4347,2Amazing,Obsidian Stout,5,"I like dark beers. I tried Coors Light...... once. Budwieser. Shitz. And the cheap ones make me ill. For me the yummy beers are dark, darker and darkest. Obsidian Stout tastes great and is definitely not less filling. I'm a one and done beer drinker so this one is perfect for me. If this beer isn't sold in Germany, it should be. I would take this beer over any Hefeweizen any day.

I noticed the label on the bottle I have is different from the label on the above photo however, the name is the same: Deshits, its dark and smelly too. It definitely tastes better than the Deshits name would suggest. I really like this beer."
4348,davidward,Obsidian Stout,4,"A very good traditional style stout. Pours a dark hue. It has robust, rich flavors of dark chocolate, roasted malt and licorice. I was fortunate to have it at the brewery itself."
4349,BeerGeekExtraordinaire,Obsidian Stout,4,"Rated the same way I do Untappd. 

Poured into a tulip glass. 

Very dark in color. Tan head 

Coffee and subtle chocolate aroma. 

It's an ""old school"" stout. No big adjuncts. Big roasty character with espresso notes. But it doesn't finish with the really assertive coffee bitterness. It finishes a bit more smooth. I think maybe there are some chocolate notes that are helping accomplish that. Quite enjoyable. I tried it with some gouda cheese and it worked really well."
4350,BEER-NICK,Obsidian Stout,4.5,Great beer!
4351,MaddDoGG5150,Obsidian Stout,3.97,"Appearance: Pours a black cola color with brown hues. A small, khaki colored foam head. Lacks retention.

Aroma: Roasted malts, peanut shells, and bread. 

Taste: Roasted malts and a nice bitter hoppy bite up front, coffee, molasses, and a little bit of chocolate in the middle. Slightly biscuity and fades into a milder bitterness that lingers around in the finish. 

Overall: this is a pretty decent stout. The taste is surprisingly complex for the rather simple aroma."
4352,Sigmund,Double IPA,3.5,"Shared bottle at local tasting, thanks to gunnar. ABV is 8.5%. Golden colour, huge white head. Sweetish aroma of malts and orange marmalade. Distinctly hoppy flavour throughout, very bitter finish. Maybe not very complex, but good."
4353,VoodooBear,Double IPA,3.62,"Presentation: 12 oz. can, served in a Samuel Adams pint glass.

Appearance: One finger head that sticks around for a while and leaves some good lacing. Cloudy, dark gold color.

Smell: Dank, musky hop aroma, some fresh citrus peel with faint malt and grain notes in the background.

Taste: Bitter, but not overwhelmingly so. It has more of a juicy, fruity, sweet citrus character which is nice. A faint, piney aftertaste remains.

Mouthfeel: Smooth and medium bodied with medium high carbonation.

Overall: Nothing new or groundbreaking here, which is fine. A solid DIPA and a damn good beer."
4354,jacobdunne,Double IPA,4.45,There’s a simultaneous malt & fruity kick on each sip. The piney aftertaste is blatant and incredible. Yummy beer!
4355,HorseheadsHophead,Double IPA,4.25,"L: Hazy orange with a rocky white head. Medium-plus retention. A thin film hangs out forever. Rings of lacing are left behind.

S: Huge yellow grapefruit and tangerine aromas; spraying oils, juicy flesh, and bitter pith. Some ripe mango and pineapple, honey and caramel, and massive pine sap and dankness.

T: Orange creamsicle, yellow grapefruit peel, honey, toasted white bread, overripe mango, pine resin finish. Moderately sweet, although the finish grows crisp. Moderate lingering bitterness.

F: Medium-plus, well-carbonated, smooth, creamy, and well-rounded. Finishes slightly sticky and resinous, but fairly clean for the style.

O: A superb example of West Coast Double IPA. A delicious hoppy offering."

Enjoyed at the end of 2022
Bottle no. 143884

Pours a wonderful caramel-burgundy with a thick layer of cocoa colored foam on top. The aroma is fantastic, with layers of stone fruit, plummy jammy raisin with hints of dark chocolate, leather, and tobacco on the end. The sip follows, creamy, with a lingering finish. Subtly sweet, with an effervescence that keeps it lively. A delightful sipper. Utterly fantastic."
4359,REVZEB,Vintage Ale,4.66,"Had 2010 bottle that has been cellared 12 years. At last I finally got to try this one, only took coming to London itself! Pours dark brown and murky with a short lived tan cap. Nose has a sherry note to it, the wife say cognac, either way this sweeter booziness is met with caramel, oxidized apricot, date, barley, and leather. Taste adds a bevy of dark fruit, golden raisin and a kiss of fresh cut hay on the end with the old yeast. So luxuriously smooth, sneaky light, quenching, and dry with a whisper of resin. This one is special for its style. Paired wonderfully with a pub sunday roast"
4360,MadMadMike,Vintage Ale,4.21,"2019 vint, bottle 06240. 
Poured at fridge temp into a snifter. 
There’s a casual head that lasts only a little while. Color is dark amber.
Smell is sweet malt, stone fruit, light caramel.
Taste is cherry-ish, sweet toffee. Hops are evident, but balance well within the overall profile. No real bitterness to be found.
Feel is light carbonation, smooth.
Overall, despite being bottle conditioned, I can’t imagine that anything else would develop by cellaring this beauty any longer. It’s packaging, presentation, look, feel and taste are spot-on right now."
4361,robotic_being,Vintage Ale,4.21,2016 Vintage drank in 2022. Amazingly rich flavor and solid carbonation. Complex and delicious!
4362,ChrisCage,Vintage Ale,4.5,"2021 Vintage, bottle #139563....

A- Pours a lovely orange hued dark bronze color, is semi opaque, and the head, which is about two fingers thick, shows a shade of creamy white with toffee infusion. The carbonation appears to be somewhat mellow, with only a few columns slumbering there way upward, with the lacing showing rather well and stickily. I am being painted a grouping of cave art like animals around the inside of the glass....very nice looking overall!

S- Heavy malt profile here, with plenty of caramel/toffee sweetness, dark fruit flesh, such as plum and fig richness, various citrus nuances (tangerine, blood orange, grapefruit, pomello), and a sweet alcoholic nature, of rum soaked raisins. The finish has some interesting fruity bitter hops, which would explain what I read about the experimental CF182 variety being used here....I even detect some pineapple tropical like aromas on the end!

T- Very well balanced overall, with a wonderful blend of toffee/caramel malt sweetness, rummy raisin/plum/fig richness, slight orchard fruitiness. After I get through all of this, my palate is hit once again by a second round of malt bomb....full of sweet cooked brown sugar, dark toffee, molasses, sugarcane, and dulce de leche. The finish showcases some very British flavors found in traditional pale ales.....zesty citrus peel, tropical fruitiness and dry leafy herbal tones, quenching the palate and leading me on to want more!

M/O- I,ve enjoyed aged vintages from Fullers before and this is the first time I've had one right after release....I have to say that I am impressed with the overall flavors and richness for something so ""fresh"". The carbonation is smooth and allows the full flavors to release onto the palate gently, while the body is somewhere in the medium-full range. The alcohol is incredibly well hidden and soft for an 8.5% brew, but I don't believe this would be something with a high drinkability factor....one is plenty in a sitting. I appreciate the usage of experimental hops and the attempt to create something unique, which I think fits the bill here.....overall this is an exceptional English style Pale Ale, and would become a great Old Ale after several years of aging!"
4363,RaulMondesi,Vintage Ale,4.18,"This one isn’t hog wild - and it isn’t supposed to be. But what I feel, what it does to me is remind me of a gentle moment. A moment with her; not the one that was meant for me, but one that still gave me that night and made me feel. I’ll always remember you, baby, even if you aren’t in my trophy case.

Be well, my children."
4364,Alieniloquium,Vintage Ale,3.39,"500 mL bottle. Vintage 2020. Pours murky amber. Smells of... cardboard right off the bat. Spicy hops with some berry fruitiness behind it. Deep caramel undertones. Tastes of sweet caramel with a combination of spicy and, again, berry fruity hops. Cardboard isn't as noticeable here, as it's got a pronounced hop bitterness. Still has a little bit, though. Medium heavy, fairly sweet. Not boozy, but hits hard after a few sips. I picked this up because I haven't seen one in a long time. My memory of this is fonder than the current experience."

4367,Sabtos,Vintage Ale,4.24,"Beautifully clear copper-red under a well-retaining khaki head that slowly settles to an unevenly bubbly yet flat collar.

While it may be mildly unfair for me to rate this 2010 bottle straight up, it's clearly intended for extensive aging, which I don't feel caused it much detriment anyway.

That said, it exhibits distinct characteristics of grape and prune, and as such lands well within the intended range of emulating wine. These characteristics are accented by softly light notes of pumpernickel and melba toast before exhaling floral tobacco.

The body is smoothly slick with a lightly soft carbonation that fines out into a faintly tingling, slightly numbing, semi-dry finish. Over time, that leafy, floral tobacco verges into cigar skin to delicately dry the palate out further."
4368,jjamadorphd,Big Black Voodoo Daddy,4.48,"I was expecting to get a very booze-forward stout, but instead I ended up drinking a well-balanced, and at times almost something akin to a dessert beer. Great dark looking beer, the smell was malty and sweet to match the taste. Mouthfeel was medium-bodied but smooth and overall this ended up being something very good, after letting it sit a year (I should mention...)"
4369,StonedTrippin,Big Black Voodoo Daddy,4.24,"easily the best beer ive had from these guys so far, this one from the can, a sturdy and complex imperial stout with a lot of layers to it and no barrel ageing despite it having some definite woodiness and maturity to it, impressive in its quality, hopefully a sign of things to come from these guys, who have been totally hit or miss for me so far. black indeed in the glass, viscous and sticky looking, and without much head, but this doesnt need more bubbles and its not all that sweet as these go. its a treat for the senses, notes of licorice, raisin, and smoke in the aroma, fudge brownie, espresso, and butter roasty notes in the flavor, cigar, black pepper, toffee, brown sugar, and light vanilla weave in and out as well, and this ends up being quite complex as they go, and exceedingly well refined for its size, it almost makes me wonder how some of their other, seemingly easier to make styles, can be so pedestrian or even off. nice chocolate wrinkle to this, both milk and dark and very organic seeming, perhaps also some rye spice or something in the mash, this has more earthy intensity to it than a lot of these, and there is some mellowing oak character as well but without being barrel aged which is cool. black fig, black coffee, and smoke to close, smooth and long in body and aftertaste, it hides its strength pretty well, and on the whole this is really pretty great. i wish these guys well in boise!"
4370,BuxMontBeerLover,Big Black Voodoo Daddy,4.24,"Purchased at Wegmans, Warrington, PA. 4pk/12oz cans.

As expected, this brew pours a jet, midnight, no moon black. A small, quickly fading beige head.

Aromas of sweet chocolate and malts.

An excellent imperial stout. A delicious and rich tasting brew with flavors of sweet chocolate, roasted malts, caramel, vanilla and a slightly bitter aftertaste. The ABV is well hidden but needs to be respected at 12%. A sipper and a one a night type of brew for me.

Very creamy, smooth mouthfeel with mild carbonation.

Overall, a great brew. As we head into Fall, this is the perfect beer to relax with, sip and savor. My first beer from Voodoo Brewing from my home state and I’m impressed. Would certainly seek out and purchase again…cheers!"
4371,tradershmulie,Big Black Voodoo Daddy,4.66,"Wow. 

Absolutely one of the most insane heads I've seen on a really cold stout. The head of three fingers just sat there. Bubbly beautiful light brown. The beer a much darker brown, but not too dark. 

Not much on the nose.

Great beer."

Candi sugar sweetness infused with cardamom and ginger; honey and sweet barley; light graininess; well-hidden booziness; slight note of pear and orange; yeasty. Heavy body; thick and sticky; coats the palate.

This is a phenomenal holiday beer, rich and flavorful. I suspect a different glass and a bit of warmth on the beer may open the aroma some. Regardless, a fine sweet, spicy, estery, boozy holiday delight.

Appearance: Hazy brown colored body with a white head which comes off very foamy with an initial rise of over one fingers length off the body.

Smell: bland aroma of caramel and malt. It's almost the fermentation smell when you visit a brewery. Not the most pleasant but the worst. 

Taste: Complex toffee and vanilla with a mild cinnamon notes. Very addicting taste. Think of barley and honey meshed to with the above to make an addicting brew which is hard to keep down. 

Mouth: medium to strong carbonation. Depends how long you let it sit for. Softens a bit after you let it settle. Sticky body which stays with you but not as super potent.

Inviting aromas of Belgian yeast, dark bread crust, banana, grape, nutmeg, coriander, and just a whiff of that 12% alcohol.

Medium to full mouthfeel. Soft and delightful.

Sweet bread and ""Belgiany"" taste with bread, herbs and spices, maybe brown sugar, tannin, and a warming alcohol bite that keeps it mildly dry at the finish. I am drinking it in May but this is something I would enjoy as much on a cold winter night."

Aroma of green apple and coriander. Expressive yeast.
Taste is a combination of flavors - dark fruit and green apple, toasted malt, and fruity hops (tangerine and lime). The malts hold the hops in the aftertaste.
Medium plus mouth feel. Has a certain stickiness, along with a sour cleansing bite). The head is forever, very supportive carbonation.

4388,Gatch,Ayinger Weizenbock,4.83,"Very excited to try this beer, which is one of the last Ayinger beers I haven't enjoyed. When the waiter dropped the daily specials menu on the table, I was pumped to see this vom fass. 0,33l pour “fassausschank” at the Ayinger Bräustüberl for €4,30. Here it’s listed as 7,0 Vol% and described as “top-fermented Weizenstarkbier.” ‘Tis the season. Pours a gorgeous cloudy golden-yellow with a massive, fluffy head. Nose is holiday spices, yeast, faint barn, and otherwise similar to a strong Hefe. Wow, the flavor is off the charts. Like a boozier quality Hefe with plenty of spiced yeast and fruit. So creamy and rich yet insanely drinkable. Smooth, fresh, approachable. What a beer. This brewery continues to astound and impress. Wow.

After enjoying lunch at the Braustuberl the day after Thanksgiving 2023, I walked down to the brewery and snagged a 0,33l bottle dated 16.11.23 (a week old!) at the Ayinger Getrankemarkt for the outrageous price of 0,85 euro! This is a Hefe on steroids. Pours a thick, opaque golden-orange. My palate isn't sophisticated enough to discern the complexity of this beer, but all I know is that it's world-class. Likely the greatest example of the style that I've come across. Candied fruits, freshly ground aromatic spices, sugary booze. There's so much more here but I fail to find words. It goes down like a beer have its strength. Wow. Just wow. Ayinger is the best brewery in Germany. I'm sticking with that statement."

Nose: Bread, clove.

Mouthfeel: Medium, appropriate for style, adequate carbonation.

Attack: Malt depth, clove, dried stone fruit — maybe apricot, alcohol evident but not overpowering. The flavor even deepens further as it warms, and a little banana emerges.

Finish: A little bitterness — just enough for the style, alcohol warming.

Overall: A fine example of this style, and a very nice pairing for the chicken curry we’re enjoying with it."

4391,Rug,Ayinger Weizenbock,4.07,"Well the back label unfortunately fell off of this one, so the bottling date is unknown. At least it’s a Weizenbock so even if it’s older it’s probably holding up pretty well. It’s always fun to try this style since you rarely see them, and this is one of the classic examples. Let’s crack it open

Pours a cloudy orange gold with 2 fingers of creamy off white head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing

The nose here is very bright, yet gentle at the same time. I’m picking up on aromas of orange zest, sweet homey, bready malt, overripe banana, clove, toasted grain, floral hops, toffee, and bubblegum

In taste it seems more raw and unrefined, leaning hard into the phenols. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting bready malt, sweet honey, clove, burnt sugar, bubblegum, earthy wheat, peppery hops, and light banana. The swallow brings notes of clove, banana bread, sweet honey, toffee, orange zest, black pepper, light toast, and earthy wheat

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a creamy beer. Finishes neutral and balanced

It’s not the best example of the style, but still damn good. Worth trying if you’re into Weizenbocks"

Overall: Only my second of the style, but clearly a fantastic Weizenbock. Nice orange citrus and wheat flavors with just enough bread spice and bubblegum in the yeast to invite another sip. Relatively clean and dry. Extremely flavorful and drinkable. Nice orange citrus, bubblegum, yeast. This one is perfection. 
Updated Rating 2023: More smooth, melded, malty flavors. Sweet. (Updated Rating: 4.10)"

Taste is rich, creamy and sweet. Notes of banana, banana candy, citrus, white bread, cloves and yeast. 

Mouthfeel is thick, smooth and well carbonated.

Overall, an outstanding Weizenbock. ticks all the boxes."
4396,leaddog,Abbaye Des Rocs Grand Cru Belgian Special Brown,3.39,"9.5% on the bottle. 

Upon opening up this bottle, it gushed and lost nearly half the bottle. Not sure as to quality control with this one. 

Appearance - Pours a copper brown with a finger of bubbly white head. 

Smell - fruity esters of raisin, plum, and fig, low spicy hops, toffee malts, caramel, and earthy yeast. 

Taste - fruity esters of raisin, plum, and fig upfront but not potent enough for the style. The hint of spicy hops come through next. The toffee malts, caramel, and earthy yeast round out the brew. The flavours are not that potent which is very dissapointing.

Mouthfeel - Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Finishes a tad thin. 

Overall - A disappointing brew that started off on the wrong foot. Nearly loosing half the beer due to gushing is a terrible sign of this brewery's quality control. Perhaps this was an off-bottle."
4397,Sigmund,Abbaye Des Rocs Grand Cru Belgian Special Brown,3.71,"1.5 liter magnum bottle, RBESG 2005 Grand Tasting. ABV was 10%. Intense oaky and malty aroma. Flavour is also intensely oaky and moderately sweet. I probably drank it too warm, will need to rerate when available at cellar temperature. As it was, it’s not my definite favourite, but obviously a well crafted beer."
4398,JonnoWillsteed,Abbaye Des Rocs Grand Cru Belgian Special Brown,4.12,"Lable has changed, it's now more text + subtle pared back indigo blue graphics on white than that pictured in the headers. ABV is marked as 9.5% instead of the 9.0% in the headers.
Front lable reads: 'Brasserie Des Rocs, Grand Cru, Belgian Special Brown Ale'.
L- Pours very rich intense chestnut brown, clear, though I see now some minor sediment was left in the bottle. 3mm pale tan head.
S- Pungent deep roasted fruits. Reminds me of British Xmas pudding. This is a good sign IME touch wood.
T- The Smell follows into the Taste, plus a little more somewhat dry and toasty edge on top. Perhaps that's what differentiates this from a Belgian tripel, which at this ABV% I'd expect to be much richer.
F- Pungent, quite a hefty feel. Somewhat dry for a 9.5% though, I notice in the subtle little lick of hoppy zing I get on my tongue/palate as I swallow. I think it's cleverly balanced. 
O- Nice. It has a power and one that is quite reined in for 9.5% Nothing leaps out and beats you over the head. Nothing at all strikes me as at all out of balance. Very drinkable and I'd happily drink it again. This style would work best for me in colder months.... visions of kicking back and slow-sipping a couple of these in front of a log fire that maybe one day I'll own :)

4399,aleigator,Abbaye Des Rocs Grand Cru Belgian Special Brown,3.56,"Pours a hazelnut brown color with a huge, stable eggshell colored head.

Smells of milk chocolate, green peppers, allspice and anise. Quite forward on the spices, this manages to establish a balancing herbal hop presence on the nose, providing an intriguing depth.

Has a soft, medium bodied mouthfeel with a fitting, lighter effervescence during its finish.

Has a soft, almost aqueous beginning, followed up by bakers chocolate, cardamom and glazed toffee, together with a light note of dried leaves. Those produce a pleasant dryness, feathering the overall malt sweetness in this a bit, allowing for spicy licorice and a whiff of milk chocolate to cut through. Finishes with even more spicy, chewy licorice and sweeter turning chocolate among rock sugar and very light noble hops.

Quite pleasant with a great mouthfeel to it, this provides a classic belgian sweetness with a satisfying depth to it."

Sweet caramel, toffee, yeasty Belgian spices, raisin, brown sugar, and a bit of booziness on the nose.
Taste follows - delicious caramel, Belgian spice, toffee, dark fruits, a touch of booze on a backbone of malty sweetness.
Medium bodied but briskly carbonated leading to a creamy deliciously sweet finish, 
The floating debris was a bit unnerving but else this was fantastic."

The flavour follows the nose. Sweet with dark and dried fruit notes and strong malt notes innen the back with nice notes off caramel, dark bread and cocoa . It then gets more hints off spices in the flavour before finishing with some slight bitter notes balanced nicely with the malt background. Nice strenght and lenght in the aftertaste.

Pours a hazy strawberry red color with a fairly large fizzy pink head that dissipates quickly down to nothing. Carbonation appears huge. Aromas of berry jam, pale malts, subtle funk, tart red fruits including of course cherry but also strawberry. There’s a uniqueness to the aroma that differentiates it’s from most lambic, perhaps a product of the blending as it appears this is not 100% lambic but a blend with some other base beer. Regardless i really did the aroma. Taste is much more sour than the aroma implied. Balanced by the big berry notes. some oak, only funk is the burnt plastic kind there’s almost no pungent character which I prefer. Mouthfeel is a bit harsh, it’s just so heavily carbonated it’s almost hard to drink without belching or getting hiccups. Never had that happen with a beer before. This also somewhat limits it’s drinkability. Overall, quite a nice beer, but lacking when compared to some of the greatest Belgium lambic.

Nose sour cherry, red wine, red wine vinegar, and oak. Taste is relatively moderate on the sour scale, balanced by a bit of sweet cherry. There a bit of underlying bitterness mid-palate, and the oak shines through as well on the finish. Very refreshing, very enjoyable."

S: Crystal malts, bitter toffee, resin, pine, umami richness. 

T: Dank, resinous and weedy. Mouth coating bitterness, tangy caramel. Super throwback taste vibes, and I love it. 

M: Full and smooth. Carbonation is mild but spot on for the taste. Bitterness lingers long, especially at the side and bottom of the tongue. 

O: This is a West Coast time machine in a glass. There's no tropical fruit bowl, haze or cryohop in sight. This is a bitter beer stripped back to its fundamentals and 100% awesome as a result.

4412,tedeum,Racer 5,1.41,"I rated this great West Coast IPA years ago with a rating over 4.4 under a now lost username. I have some bad news about my favorite Northern California IPA.
Bear Republic Brewing Co. of Cloverdale, California was acquired by Drake's Brewing Co. of San Leandro, California early in 2023. Newspaper stories of the time stated that Drake's would be brewing Racer 5 again from their brewery in San Leandro. Drake's acquired all of the Bear Republic intellectual property including recipes, trademarks and packaging rights.
Well, that was the story, at least.
I was a purchaser of Racer 5 in 12-pack bottles. The cardboard boxes stated that it was brewed in Sonoma County. On June 12 of 2023 I purchased what I believed to be Bear Republic Racer 5 IPA. This cardboard box claimed Racer 5 was brewed in San Jose with a bottling date of May 11, 2023. The brew contained in these bottles was not the same Racer 5 that I dearly loved. The substantial layer of brewer's yeast at the bottom of each bottle was gone, meaning that this brew was no longer a genuine bottle-conditioned IPA. The head was gone. Carbonation was nearly flat. The full-bodied ""IPA"" was now thin and watered down like any cheap canned ""IPA."" Odd smell and off-taste. The complex hops profile was absent and now tasted suspiciously of Citra or Galaxy. I made a call to Drake's and they told me that Racer 5 was now brewed by Gordon Biersch of San Jose. They assured me that when Drake's started production of Racer 5 the boxes would be marked as brewed in San Leandro.
That's the miserable end of Racer 5 for me. I will watch for future production of Racer 5 from San Leandro should that actually happen. Sorry to be the bearer (no pun intended) of bad news."
4413,MeanMotaScootah,Racer 5,3.65,"Aroma was malty and slightly piney, medium carb, two finger head. Taste - very malty, bready and thick with butterscotch notes. Lots of sticky piney hop bittering. Not sure how this differs from a New England IPA but nonetheless it ain't no West Coast IPA despite the fact it's brewed on the West Coast. So I guess for the style is right on. This is a classic IPA from Bear Republic so definitely a must try if you're an IPA connoissieur."
4414,nizzle8287,Racer 5,5,"Pours a delightful hazy orange with a voluminous off-white head that lasts, giving epic lacing.
Smell is sweet caramel, oranges, apricots, and slight honeydew.
Taste follows the smell nicely with no off flavors. A bit less honeydew in the taste, and a bit more apricot and orange. Sweet, or perhaps semi-sweet... Malt-forward, but still quite hoppy with a lasting bitter finish.
Feel is very smooth and full-bodied; carbonation is moderate and just right for this style. ABV is there, but not pressing.
Overall, an under-rated, old-school, west-coast IPA that is a must try for all die-hard IPA lovers."
4415,JZH1000,Racer 5,3.86,"Poured from an unfortunately undated 16oz can

On the first pour an insane four finger head formed. Pretty good retention too, as it took me 6ish minutes to pour the whole pint into a Spieglau IPA glass. After pouring I had a stiff rocky white sudsy head that left foamy lacing. Body is a hazy golden yellow.

Aroma comes off as sweet, in a big beer sense, but is immediately followed by big resiny hops with rhindy citrus notes in the back. Like if pine sap was lemon scented? Super hoppy but in a fresh herbal way. A touch of ""ale"" character in the way back.

Flavor is smooth and drinkable with a wave of bitterness. Tasting notes mostly follow the aroma, but the sweetness dissapears completely, due to the bitterness. Full flavor implies a maltiness, but the hops cover up any true malt character, as typical for the style. Lemony pine resin with a dry malt insinuating finish is the main experience.

Feel is drinkable verging on dangerous for the ABV. Very easy to drink and quite smooth, although the finish is quite dry and bitter. The dryness begins verging on astringency, and I'm unsure if that is due to hopping rates, or something else. Very full with a medium long finish.

Overall this is a decent legacy IPA. It's super drinkable, very ""beery"" and pretty enjoyable. Bright herbal citric and overall hoppy, this is what I thought an IPA tasted like when my mom explained hops to me as a kid, and I still didn't appreciate beer. Classic old school IPA, this is what a WCIPA should be IMO."
4416,LucidoMMA,Racer 5,3.79,"Pours a golden color with a finger soapy head.

4417,TooManyGlasses,Racer 5,4.49,"Been some time since had a Racer 5 - ?San Francisco 2017??
Pours a bright very slightly hazed golden with solid two fingers of tight bubbly just off white head.
Aroma of bready malt, floral with touch of pine and big swath of orange, tangerine and tropical fruit - underwhelming at first but popped as warmed just a touch (this is on me!).
Tastes an explosion of hops - citrus, a bit of pine, fruity with notes of mango, tangerine; certainly a floral presence and a bright spicy bitterness that coats the palate balanced by bready caramel malt sweetness.
Medium full mouthfeel with a coating bittersweetness that lingers nicely.
This is a classic for a reason and on a short list of ""desert island"" beers."
4418,TurboMon_911,Racer 5,4.25,"Canned Aug/28/22. Poured a semi-lucid golden straw color, with an off white pillowy 2 fingers high head, that leaves a fair amount of lacing, into a Samuel Smith Imperial pint glass."
4419,J_Brew_99,Racer 5,4.85,"Overall, this is the epitome of a classic west coast style IPA. Not overly hoppy, medium to heavy body, and the notes are more floral than bitter. Doesn't taste like a 7% abv beer and would recommend checking out!"
4420,brureview,Racer 5,4.35,"I haven’t tasted this beer in a long time. Bear Republic didn’t distribute in my area for a while.
Great beer! If an award was given for balance in an IPA, it should be given to Racer 5.
Light clear, golden amber color. Floral, piney aroma. Silky MF. Piney, spicy taste. Not too hoppy.

Medium body with moderate carbonation, foamy mouthfeel and finish"
4423,Whyteboar,Red's Rye IPA,4.57,"Astounded that I have not reviewed this yet. It is the single beer that I have never fell out of favor with. Others come and go as tastes change but this one always hits the sweet spot for me.
Pours a lovely burnished red and sports a manilla colored head for a little while.
The aroma is hoppy and malty and just an ideal combination of these.
The taste is where this really shines. Crisp is the word- such a balanced layering of flavors from spices to caramel to citrus and a refreshing bitterness to finish the sip. 
The feel is ideal for the style, I am not sure it can be improved.
OA, it’s always on draft around W Michigan which is good as they seldom bottle or can it as it looses flavor quickly. Or so they say. I’d rather drink an older container of this than not drink it at all.
Really good beer!"

On the one hand, it looked great and tasted great, but on the other, it's scent was somewhat meh to me and the mouthfeel was super carbonated. It was so carbonated that it essentially detracted from the overall experience, even after I let it warm a bit. Overall, it's still a good beer, just not one that ""tingled"" my toes..."

L: beautiful brown color, nice foam.
S: nutty, sweet.
T: sweet nutty taste. A bit like sweet wines. Caramelized malt.

4429,KomodoDragon,Trappist Dubbel,4.14,"beautiful copper color, so darn clean. small head, efficient lacing. 

So many rich scents, banana, clove, toast, caramel, herbal hops.

Many rich flavors. robust sweet caramel malt. Breadiness, some fruit, dried figs or even apricots. Hefty carbonation hides the transition flavors to the finish, which is long and lingering, accompanied with some more sticky sweetness. Almost port like sweetness. 

Nice and complex, and super well crafted. A lot going on, and more to explore with each sip."
4430,mactrail,Trappist Dubbel,4.29,Very frothy ruby-brown brew with beige foam in the big Duvel tulip. Aroma of dark fruit and raisins in the nose. Rich and lively on the tongue. The taste is warm and dark with a woody fragrance. Deeply malty with a delicious roasted flavor enhanced by the yeast. The sweet candy note is restrained but essential along with the dates and figs. A great historic brew to sip and savor. These Belgian brews are seeming like bargains given the quality and the silly prices of even average U.S. craft brews. From the 330 ml bottle purchased on the West Coast. Apparently bottled Feb 08 2023.
4431,nasal,Trappist Dubbel,4.29,"Fantastic rich brown beer. Raisiny. Not one of my favorite beers of all-time, but a fantastic beer. Funky flavors come out when it warms up, so don't drink this straight from the fridge."

4434,Snowcrash000,London Porter,4.17,"Pours a deep, dark mahogany coloration with a ruby sheen when held up the light and a medium, creamy head. Smells of bready, roasted malt and chocolate, with just a hint of herbal hops as well. Taste is a great balance of roasted, slightly caramelly malt, milk chocolate, much lighter dark/red fruit, with notes of raisin and cranberry and just a hint of coffee, licorice and earthy, herbal hops. Finishes with a medium bitterness and some roasted malt, chocolate and licorice lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation.

This makes for a very nice English Porter with distinct notes of roasted malt and chocolate and a great balance of sweet, roasted and bitter notes, with the roasted and bitter notes clearly dominating, just like I like it. Hints of drak/red fruit, coffee and licorice add a certain depth while earthy, herbal hops provide that certain bitterness to this. It's just a very well-balanced, easy drinking yet flavorfull example of the style with a good body and mouthfeel for the style as well."

Feel is smooth and easy drinking. Medium-light mouthful with nice carbonation that remains present yet soft. Overall, I am enjoying this beer a lot.

4440,damndirtyape,Blushing Monk,3.74,"12oz bottle served in a tulip glass. Bottled on 11/24/20 17202. I just bought this and I can see why it got lost on the shelves. It's a white date stamp on a pale off-white label. Not real smart. Let's hope I'm not about to regret my life choices with a really old beer. 

Appearance: Hazy/murky copper-red color, with a thin white head that died back. A few islands of lacing here and there. Sadly, not the best looking beer. 

Smell: Definite raspberry note. A little bit of underlying yeastiness and some funk as well. Starting to wonder if 2 years after bottling this is taking on some lambic character. 

Taste: So not a lambic - it's not that tart/sour. Definite raspberry note, with some underlying aspects of a Belgian tripel (herbal leafy hop note, some muted Belgian yeast character). I feel like the Belgian character may be somewhat lost here. 

Mouthfeel: Good thickness, quite sticky and somewhat juice-like. Light carbonation. Still - it held its carbonation this long. 

Overall / Drinkability: For a beer that is over 2 years old....it's still got some of it's original character, but the Belgian character is mostly swamped out from the Raspberry that still dominates this far on. So for an unexpected cellared beer, it's okay. I will see if I can score a fresh bottle and try it again - but note to the brewer: Use a laser / ink system that puts a black date stamp onto a white label."

4444,Whyteboar,Blushing Monk,4.39,"Bottled on 11/23/2020, drank on 5/3/2022, so may need to revisit this when I try a fresh one. But for those of you curious about how it held up, read on-
Poured reddish amber, deeply hued, and sported a manila colored 1 cm head for a minute or two, leaving behind a thin ring which left regular lacing.
The aroma is still all about the raspberries. But there is a secondary note in there that reminds me, of all things, angel food cake. Hmmmm.
The flavor starts out strong with raspberry but later mellows to a semi sweet malty ale that is sheer pleasure to drink. The angel food cake shows up in the flavor as well, very curious and very tasty.
The feel took me back a bit, far more viscous than expected, but that's likely on me. This is a fruited ""Strong"" Belgian ale and a little viscosity isn't misplaced. Just unexpected. Maybe fresh the carbonation balances it out more.

4447,Cwrw,La Trappe Quadrupel (Koningshoeven / Dominus),4.14,"Pours out into my goblet a cloudy burnt orange with an enormous off white foaming head. One of the least dark quads I've had. A topping of head sticks around and leaves some lacing on the glass. Looks great.

Sugary hits up front on the aroma, a candied sweetness combined with orange and banana and a yeasty funk. Nice. Honey, dates, a bit of molasses, maybe some roasted almonds along with caramel and vanilla. The nutty almond aroma increases as the beer warms in the glass, but it's the yeasty spiciness that keeps me coming back. 

Taste is more of the same, plenty of sweet almond and orange and banana. The finish has a tinge of alcohol, but it ends mainly sweet as you might expect. Sugary, almost rum-like in flavour in the middle. Horehound, honey, caramel and a nice roasted malty profile. A touch of cinnamon and spiciness from the yeast. A very sweet aftertaste. Delicious.

Mouthfeel is velvety and moderately carbonated. Dangerously quaffable at this percentage. While not, in my opinion, comparable to some of the other Trappist Quads, this is still an amazing beer."
4448,BillyNoonan,La Trappe Quadrupel (Koningshoeven / Dominus),4,"Pours murky amber with tan-white cap. Instant banana and malt on nose. Taste is dark and dreamy, punchy and heat of alcohol, sweetness of raisin soaked in rum and molasses. Lethally drinkable. Shortcut to smashed!"
4449,Profundobaso,La Trappe Quadrupel (Koningshoeven / Dominus),3.93,"Look - 330ml bottle poured into a 250ml chalice. ruby amber in color, with a large foamy head that mostly dissipates, leaving behind little to moderate lacing. lightly cloudy.

Smell - familiar phenols from the style, accompanied by dried fruits (raisins), almonds, and caramel.

Taste - vanilla hits the palate first, with a fair bit of sweetness and caramel notes. finish is slightly spicy and warming.

Feel - medium bodied, average carbonation, and a relatively strong one at 10% ABV. alcohol is well masked but detectable from the warmness.

Overall - a solid heavy hitter that is scarily easy to drink. flavor wise I actually prefer some of the lower ABV offerings, but this one still gets most things right."

It decided to foam at opening, but not disastrously. Very pretty in the glass, very smooth going down. This could be a dangerous ""I'm thirsty"" beer...."
4453,JohnniEMc,La Trappe Quadrupel (Koningshoeven / Dominus),4.19,"Served in a clear pint glass, filled with almost no off-white head, from a tap it came. It's brightly copper-amber and just slightly cloudy. It provides that Belgian smell of yeast and malt, with a little hops added. It's banana-like sweet and unfortunately, a bit of banana-like stickiness comes with it. But, not so much more than others within the style, even the great ones. To its credit, there is also much more than the banana hit. The notes described almond and vanilla presence and vanilla is a definite. There's also some cinnamon, or maybe clove reference that, with the ABV, provides a nice bite. Overall, this drinks mostly sweet and spicy. The aforementioned stickiness is much better than it being too thin. There's no glass lacing and little alcohol hit, which is only an asset to the overall taste. This hits all the right notes for a Belgian Quad, so those that love them will love this one."

Pours a medium reddish amber, a little cloudy, with a one and a half inch foamy head with very good retention and a decent amount of foamy lacing. Aromas of caramel, malt, banana, spices, grapes, Candi sugar, a bit of a sweet aroma as it warms. Mostly similar flavors- caramel, malt, spices, grapes, Candi sugar, some plums, a light, earthy hop bitterness midway through the finish. Smooth, semi- dry, a very good medium body, well carbonated.

This is lighter than typical for the style, but matches up well to any Quad. The grapes and caramel are the most prominent. Very enjoyable."

Dark body, red wine when held up to the light. Small off white head shrinks to a ring, specks of lacing. Some cherry notes on the nose, but aroma seems a little off. Sour cherry taste with some woody notes. Tart & sour finish. Abv felt. Would almost certainly improve with age, best by March 2032."
4456,beerwithmeIRL,Goudenband,4.67,"375ml Paper Wrapped Bottle - Pours a dark ruby/deep brown with 1 finger foam head that dissipates rapidly. On the nose, notes of dark fruit, dried fruit and a hint of vinegar. Taste-wise, there is a high level of complexity with some really intense flavours. The notes present in the eroma are magnified and a hint of spice and caramrl is also evident. Beautiful sweetness with a very tiny touch of tart. Incredible beer."
4457,Darkmagus82,Goudenband,4.35,"Poured from a bottle into a snifter
Appearance – The beer pours a dark ruby brown red color with a small head of tan foam. The head fades rather fast, leaving a touch of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – The aroma of the brew is rather strong of dark fruit smells of plum and prune, mixed with a touch of caramel apple and some cherry. Other aromas of candied sugar and yeast are there as well, mixing in with some notes of roasted ready malts and brownies. A hint of cola and spice are there as well, creating a nice inviting aroma overall.
Taste – Thes taste starts out with a nice cherry and plum sweetness with some brown bread and candied sugar flavors. There are nice roasty notes that get stronger toward the middle of the taste profile, with them later fading a touch toward the end. At the same time the dark fruit are joined by even more flavors, with some raisin and apple coming along. All throughout there is also some yeasty flavors and some light notes of sourness, being of a tart raspberry and vinegar flavor. A bit of coriander and some oak develop as well, and with a tiny touch of char at the end, one is left with a dark fruited, very lightly soured and nicely balanced taste to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is light and thinner with a carbonation level that is high. For the style and the mix of flavors the feel is great and it makes for one dangerously easy sipper.
Overall – A very nice and tasty lightly sour Belgium ale. One I will certainly seek out again."
4458,stortore,Goudenband,4.23,"750 ml bottle into a tulip glass. 2016 edition, had 11/17/21.

Pours an opaque, dark ruby, with a two inch foamy head with very good retention and a good amount of foamy lacing. Aromas of cherries, caramel, malt, oak, some raspberries, light apple. Smells lightly sour. Tastes lightly sour and tart. Flavors of cherries, malt, caramel, oak, light apple, a hint of chocolate. Smooth, a very good medium body, well carbonated. 

Above average for the style. It’s a little lighter overall than others, but also not as cherry focused. Lots of caramel and oak among other aromas and flavors. Very easy to drink, too. Really enjoyable."
4459,neenerzig,Goudenband,4.4,"Having this beer on draft at Lizardville in Bedford, OH. Served to me in a tulip glass, this beer draws a very dark copper/amber color with A slightly off-white had that’s about an inch thick on first drawn and served. Head eventually settles to a medium sized ring lining the inside of the glass with some very small spots of surface foam. Barely any lacing to speak of. Aromas of some toasted, bready malts, notes of vinegar and lactate along with some fruity esters. A very similar flavor profile, with a toasted, bready malt presence to start off with that has hints of molasses and brown sugar sweetness. This is followed by some guide notes of apple, cherry, and dates along with a bit of lactate and vinegar that give it the nice sour note that blends so well with the molasses and brown sugar presence. Rounded out with a bit of a woody flavor. Although all of the different flavors are pretty subtle overall, this beer has a pretty complex flavor profile that I’m enjoying quite a bit. Has a somewhat crisp, also smooth, just slightly prickly, light to medium bodied mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Has a nice, long finish and all the different flavors linger nicely on my palate for a long time after each sip.

4460,GuyFawkes,Goudenband,4.42,"Had this on draft 9/1/22 @ the Hopleaf. 

Mostly see-through brown/orange appearance. 

Dark cherry, lemon & mild vinegar notes in the nose. 

Medium thin mouthfeel. 

Dark cherry & lemon flavors up front; artisanal vinegar & honey notes on the finish. 

Elegant; so easy to drink for a ""sour"" beer. A stunner."

Ruby brown colored body, with reddish backlit highlights. Thin light tan head, which sticks around. Lacing sticks on all non-drinking sides.
Aroma of red wine with earthy, dark fruit.
Taste is woody, but also sweet from the fruit - apple, cherry, and raspberry. Has the caramel also. Aftertaste trails off quickly.
Medium mouth feel, and slightly smooth and syrupy. Carbonation is not a big deal here.
Tastes like a cross between a merlot and cherry cola. This aroma and taste expression is not often found. Slightly different flavor nuances are discovered with each sip. Really a treat. Very good paired with blue cheese."
4462,GreesyFizeek,Goudenband,3.31,"On tap at Brewery Ommegang in Cooperstown, NY.

This one pours a dark-ish murky brown color, with a small head, and not much lacing.

This smells like damp wood, cherry juice, green apple, pear, and red wine vinegar.

This is simultaneously too sweet and too vinegary for me - it's kind of a cloying medicinal sweetness for me, and when mixed with the old stale vinegar aspects, it definitely clashes. There's some nice woodiness and cherry skin, but it just doesn't work out for me. I know it's a classic beer, and maybe I'm missing out on something here, but it's just a contradictory set of flavors for me.

This is medium bodied, with a lower level of carbonation, and a soft finish. It's not particularly sour, by any means.

I wanted to like this one a lot more, but maybe it's just not for me."
4463,stevoj,Imperial Stout,4.46,"Draft at BitterCreek. I thought I had hit the highlights, but then this..... F’ing WOW! Inky black , small silky head. Blah, blah, blah. Aroma is a malted chocolate bar, roasty, sweet. Taste gets better, chocolate, sweet roast grains. And smooth....Velvet, dayglo bullfighter on velvet. Hits every mark. I’m melting into my bar stool. Incredible."
4464,rodbeermunch,Imperial Stout,3.83,"This is a review of the 2013 vintage, consumed on Halloween 2017. 

Pours black but with a full sized 1"" beige colored head. Dense. Aroma was light, sweet whiskey alongside a lesser amount of roasted malt, we're talking like a 60/40 split in the nose (similar to that on the label). 

Taste was good and relatively easy going for something with a hefty amount of roasted malt, bitterness and whiskey barrel influence alongside an 11% mouth feel of alcohol that isn't anywhere near that perceptible. The yeast is far more influential taste wise, dark fruit bitterness on it, makes you think this is a quad and imperial stout blend. And I guess that would be the least desireable aspect of the beer, the bitterness from multiple sources (roasted malt, hops, yeast) that isn't fully met by the partial aging in whiskey barrels. That yeast also seems to contribute to the 'thin' notion that isn't really borne out by the hefty amount of malt going on here. I liked it, but less than your average person."
4465,macrosmatic,Imperial Stout,3.88,"Reviewed from (long-standing) notes. 2014 vintage bottle, consumed 5/16/16. Poured from a 750 mL bottle into a J. Wakefield Brewing OG teku glass.

A: Very dark brown and nearly opaque. Low visible carbonation, but a big three-finger tan head with great retention.

S: Whiskey, chocolate, vanilla, and oak. Deep moist tobacco, cacao nibs, and toffee.

T: Chocolate and roasted malts. A big punch of whiskey with some alcohol sweetness and heat. Vanilla, oak tannins, and mild barrel char. Some bitterness (roasted malts – a bit of hops? Can’t pick out specific flavors) after the swallow with fading malt and ethanol sweetness.

M: The body is fairly thin, and I think this detracts from the beer pretty significantly. Whiskey flavors are pretty dominant, and it does drink a bit “hot” but not insanely so. Low carbonation sensation.

O: The whiskey presence toes the line, but I think stops just short of being over the top. Aside from the thin body, there aren’t really flaws here…but not much to set it apart or prevent it from being forgettable. Decent, but nothing I’d go seeking out in a world crowded with barrel-aged stout offerings."
4466,HopsAreDaMan,Imperial Stout,4,"Had the 2015 version 12 oz bottle in a side-by-side with a few other imperial stouts. Although it was very good, it was not at the level of a barrel-aged RIS, so I was a bit disappointed by this beer. For the price (about $4 a bottle) I judge there are many other better imperial stouts out there."
4467,Tony210,Imperial Stout,4.44,"2014 vintage - had been in my cellar for 3+ years... Best by date is 10/2016, so I am a year late...

Pours very dark, gave me 3 fingers of foam, which was delicious (vigorous pour)! Great carbonation. Big whiskey and chocolate aromas, coffee in the background with the roasted malts. Pretty complex brew, rich and creamy, quite sweet, like s sweet milk stout, big whiskey presence, gobs of chocolate, sweet vanilla, some dark fruits, fig, prune. Viscous and sticky, fairly full bodied. Overall a nicely done brew - I am curious how it would have tasted a year or two ago.

4468,spaser,Imperial Stout,4.63,"2014 vintage, drank November 2017.

Barrel character is very apparent. Strong vanilla, and malt notes, weaker hints of chocolate, tobacco, smoke, and a touch of spiciness. To me this beer epitomizes what a barrel aged stout should taste like."
4469,Lone_Freighter,Imperial Stout,4,"This was poured into a snifter. The appearance was a dark brown close to black color with a soft and somewhat refined bubbly off white to slight tan slim head. This head died within about less than forty seconds. The lacing was there in a slightly weird messy way, but it was there. The smell started off with a boozy roasty coffee cocoa sort of blend. As it warmed, a light plum entered in. The taste was mainly boozy and sweet but did have a decent roasty quality about it. On the palate, this one sat about a medium on the body with more of a sipper aspect to it. The carbonation was slightly there but allowed a decent harshness to pervade. Overall, I say this was a good Imperial Stout it draws out all of the aspects as any Imperial Stout should. This would make a great night capper."
4470,brureview,Cadillac Mountain Stout,4.25,"I haven’t had this beers for years.

4472,cag_3939,Cadillac Mountain Stout,4.53,"Came upon this when ordering from Craft Beer Cellar. I love complex coffee-forward beers so this sounded like a good choice. I had to drink from the can so I won’t be able to comment on the color, head or lacing.
Even from the can I can smell a roast coffee, dark cherry and cocoa.
The taste is much complex than what I got from the smell. A combination of dark chocolate and roast coffee, toast, leather and a bit of ash as it wamrs.
Mouthfeel is of a medium body with moderate carbonation that is extremely smooth.
I will definitely be ordering this again. Listed as a Irish Dry Stout I can see why it’s rated"
4473,Rug,Cadillac Mountain Stout,4.26,"Time to knock out another style topper! Here we have the highest rated Irish Dry Stout on BA, and one that has apparently held similar titles for a long time per the notes ""Cadillac Mtn. Stout was selected World Champion Dry Stout 1995 and the best hard-to-find beer in America by Men’s Journal."" Cool shit. Let's see if it can live up to the expectations I've built up in my head after having this marked as a ""want"" for 3 years

Pours a muddy medium brown with a finger of tan head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing

As expected, the roast is very evident in the nose, but it is nicely balanced as well. I'm picking up on aromas of acidic coffee, dark toast, charred malt, toffee, sweet honey, herbal hops, and cocoa powder

It's also quite smooth in taste for the amount of roasted malt that's present. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting dark chocolate, medium roast coffee, burnt toast, caramel, herbal hops, and dark cherry. The swallow brings notes of acidic coffee, cocoa powder, earthy hops, dark toast, toffee, light raisin, and a touch of char

A medium body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a roasty and slick beer. Finishes mostly dry and surprisingly refreshing

Yeah, this shit is awesome. Super easy drinking even for a style where drinkability is pretty important. Definitely deserving of its ranking. I think I'll have to stock up on more now that I found it"
4474,Steviek247,Cadillac Mountain Stout,4.3,Lovely beer. Drank it at the brewery which was a great place in the woods. Not much head but lovely taste. Quite a coffee vibe going on.

Aroma: Herbal and earthy. Tropical fruits. Slightly bready

Taste: Bready up front, tropical fruits in the middle, and apricot with some subtle but notable hoppy bitterness that appears at the back end. Finish is pretty clean.

Overall: I really like this one. The aroma was good, and the flavors were quite pleasing. It’s an all around quality beer that I look forward to buying again."
4486,Darkmagus82,Hopocalypse,4.12,"Poured from a can into a pint glass
Appearance – The beer pours a super hazy golden orange with a one finger head of white foam. The head has a good level of retention, fading over time to leave a light level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – The aroma of the brew is rather heavy of an herbal and earthy hop smell mixed with a grainy and bready aroma. Other aromas of tropical fruits are there as well, with smells of tangerine, papaya, mango, and guava. Light aromas of a bit of mustiness and vegetal notes are there as well, giving a slightly more dank aroma overall. 
Taste – The taste begins with a thick bready flavor mixed with a bit of the tropical fruits that were in the nose. Right from the start there is a decent showing of an earthy hop accented by some lighter herbal and grapefruit hops. As the taste advances the tropical fruit sweetness increases a bit with the bulk of the increase being a mix of guava and tangerine. All the while the hop get even heavier in earthy flavors being accompanied by an oddly pleasant, somewhat vegetal taste. With a touch of alcohol and a bit of peach and apricot becoming noticeable at the end, one is left with a interesting, dank, and rather pleasantly satisfying hazy like IPA Taste to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is heavier with a carbonation level that is average. For the interesting flavor profile and more dank nature of the brew the feel is great and makes for a nice full bodied and flavorful sipper.
Overall – A rather nice, non-traditionally flavor hopped IPA. Very fun! It reminds me of Deschutes Hop Henge. That was a uniquely hopped beer that I very much enjoyed. So is this."

It pours a little hazy (about 50%) with soda pop bubbles (mostly biggish). The aroma is strong - skunky hops to ya. The taste is especially bitter but not dry, there is plenty of malt there too. It finishes heavy - not good for milder food but should stand up to other flavor bombs.

Highly recommended. This is the best of the three or four I've tried from Drakes."

Aroma: Citrus fruits, some dank, some fir and pine notes, blueberries, freshly baked bread lingering in the background
Taste: Follows the nose but much more pronounced. Citrus, fir needles (orange), and dank up front, followed by hints of blueberry. Good maltiness holds it all together. Good bite and medium dryness on the finish
Mouthfeel: Medium carbonation, silky and smooth overall – really good and honestly less carbonated-tasting than I expected, especially given the freshness
Overall: This is tasty stuff. This used to be a go-to for me for some time but then I got away from it so glad I was able to be reacquainted as this is really good. A well-made and great, balanced WCIPA that is readily available fresh in these parts.

Classic west coast. Grapefruit, orange pith, pine tree finish. Still some of that garlic and weedy notes at the end.

4499,woodychandler,Workhorse IPA,4.16,"Once more, the Tavour service comes through for The CANQuest (tm) is a big way! I may not be buying many bottled beers through them, but you CAN bet your bottom dollar that I am snapping up CANs as they become available. 

From the CAN: ""Huge hop flavor and aroma in a balanced Northwest-style IPA.""

I Crack!ed open the vent & CANmenced a slow, gentle Glug into the awaiting glass. I was overjoyed when it created two-plus fingers of dense, foamy, rocky, tawny head all on its own without any bidding. Color was solid Amber (SRM = > 7, < 9) with NE-quality clarity. Nose was utterly resinous with pine & now my hophead mouth was watering! Think of it - no haze, no tropical fruit, no B.S.! Mouthfeel was medium. The taste was so full of pine that I thought that I was holding the knob end of George Brett's bat! Mmmm. This was exactly the sort of thing that I had been jonesing for! It had a light woodiness and a little bit of a peach flavor to accompany the intense pine with a bit of biscuitiness. Mmmm, I was really pleasantly surprised since I thought that this type of beer was either impossible or illegal to produce currently. I jest, of course, but this was a welcome throwback to the sorts of beers that originally got my attention & made me realize that I am a self-described, self-avowed hophead. Finish was dry, bitter and just the way that I like them. YMMV."
4500,LoganLevi88,Workhorse IPA,4.46,"The problem with some WC Style IPA’s is that the brewer puts the abv above the flavor. Not on this beer though. This is a well balanced ipa, throughly impressed.

Pours black with two fingers of khaki foam. Great retention. Head is more fluffy and taller out of the can vs nitro. Aroma is heavy roasty and toasty malts with mild caramel and earthy behind. Nice roastiness that gives it depth, but not harshness. Nitro smells a touch thin vs the can. Flavor profile is roasty and toasty malts with caramel, chocolate and bready, earthy malts. Nice malt presence and oomph without being overly heavy. Mouth feel is medium in thickness with a creamy, decadent texture. The texture on nitro is even more decadent and creamy, effectively the difference between a cozy comforter and a pair of thick fuzzy wool socks on a bitter cold winter night. Overall, really lovely stout. Nothing overly complex or heavy - it's sippable, but forgiving if those sips turn into gulps.

4504,JerzDevl2000,Zonker Stout,4.18,"This was another beer that I picked up at the Whole Foods in Jackson, Wyoming when I was out that way not too long ago. Don’t have this style much but when you come across something this highly rated, it’s worth a go!

Indeed, this lived up to its lofty rating a land description as this was dark, varied, and well-balanced. Plenty of mocha head topped the liquid out although the spotty lacing left behind should have been more extensive. That was the only underwhelming aspect of this brew as the roasted, rough nose was enough to draw me in. Lots of barley and dark chocolate in it as the taste contained hints of milk chocolate, raisin, currant, and licorice. Nuanced, varied, and a bit mysterious, this was dark without being burnt, full-flavored without being rich, and full bodied without being strong. Certainly, that was no easy feat!

The carbonation was light as the flavors lingered and this was nicely roasted without being thin or sweet like espresso and coffee. I wouldn’t change the amount of alcohol in this as it was spot on, and the aftertaste was neither dry nor overtly strong. No date was written anywhere as it was a treat to see a map of the Snake River on the can once I peeled the label off. This held up well and was a clear-cut winner for it’s style as it deserved it’s rating on here. Indeed, I was glad to put this river through my liver!"
4505,mpruden,Zonker Stout,4.73,"Poured from a 12-oz can into a tulip glass.

Appearance: Very dark brown, nearly black, with a dark tan head so large that it required the beer to be poured in two stages; the head lingered long and left plenty of lacing.

Nose: Dark roast, chocolate, mixed with sweet

Mouthfeel: Wonderfully thick

Attack: Follows the nose; remarkable balance of dark roast bitter, chocolate, and coffee

Finish: Continues the attack, slight hop bitterness.

This is the ur-craft beer for me — the one that was my real introduction to craft beer many years ago, at the brewery in Jackson, Wyoming. It’s still one of my favorite beers ever — I’m ashamed that I’m just now getting around to rating it — and I bring home multiple sixes of it each summer vacation after we backpack in the Wyoming mountains. I’m not going to pretend to be unbiased; still, other reviewers seem to agree it deserves a very high rating."

Black colored body, with thin mahogany back lit edge. One finger of dark tan head. Left lacing on non-drinking side of the glass.
Aroma of dark roasted malts which express caramel, toffee, and molasses. Some chocolate and minor coffee notes.
Taste is slightly sweet with a later bit of bitterness. Dark roasted malts exude cocoa, coffee, and caramel/molasses. Avoids char, is still very dark in flavors. Has a touch of dark fruit hops.
Medium mouth feel. Silky texture. Very dry finish. Leaves some numbness on the tongue. Very good carbonation.
Classic stout that does the job with malts and no added adjuncts."
4507,StonedTrippin,Zonker Stout,4.24,"cant believe i have not rated this one until now, one of their classics and one of the best straight up stouts in the region, absolutely famous for a reason, no frills, old school extraordinarily well crafted, somehow still flies under the radar. black and shiny and frothy from the tap, looks gorgeously refined and silky, good body but not overly viscous for what it is. the nose is earthy and dry, no attempt at too much middle malt richness, dark chocolate, an almost irish thing to the yeast, some toasted breadiness, fresh ground coffee, and minerals, just a little alcohol, more at temperature, maybe oats or dark wheat in the mash here too, more nuance than most on the grain side without any real sweetness. the flavor has some charcoal character, an almost oak aged decadence and smoothness, but is yet still dry. more coffee, dark chocolate, light raisin, and mocha character, along with a silky texture than hangs around just long enough on the swallow and isnt quite neutral on the ferment, right on. subtle almost rye spice to this too, just a little more going on than in most of these, but all real subtle. they really dont make beer like this anymore, nowadays this would have vanilla and milk sugar in it, be 9% abv, and be bastardized beyond recognition. credit to snake river for a world class beer and for not feeling the need to make it trendy. if you built it they will come. it doesnt get much better than this in the style. i would love to try the nitro edition..."

4509,jkblr,Zonker Stout,4.3,"12oz can stamped 03/02/21 poured into a tulip pint glass at fridge temp 6% ABV. The beer pours dense, black in color with generous and lasting mocha colored head. The head recedes slowly to a one inch cap and leaves a web of lacing covering the glass. The aroma is mild featuring dark cocoa & slight ash with a nutty, earthy undertone. The taste is more dark chocolate with a caramel balance not found in the aroma. Mild bitterness. The mouthfeel is silky & medium bodied with less than medium carbonation and a mostly dry finish. Overall, excellent. This is a superb example of a disappearing style. Export stouts, done well, offer the character of the imperials with much better drinkability. Would definitely acquire and drink again."
4510,Jugs_McGhee,Zonker Stout,4.02,"CAN: 12 fl oz pull-tab with an understated label. Nabbed as part of a sixer from a Total Wine & More in Colorado - I think for $9.99 USD plus tax?

""Export Style Stout."" Currently ranked #1 on the top Stout - Foreign / Export list with a 93 overall score.

6% ABV.

Served cold into an oversized pint nonic snifter hybrid glass thingamajigger (I don't know what to call this glassware but it's fancy).

APPEARANCE: Pours a gorgeous gilded tan head replete with loads of creamy softness. Robust...its starting ~6-7cm head height sticks around for a good 8 minutes or so, and rich thick lacing coats the sides of the glass as the head slowly recedes. Body colour is a true to style opaque black. No yeast/lees are visible within.

Looks as an export stout ought to. I guess the head could be still more gilded and could have more of an imperial stout-like golden sheen to better effect, if we're really picking nits. I see nothing wrong with this appearance and it looks rather good.

AROMA: Roasted barley is immediately obvious, buoyed by chocolate malt, dark malt sweetness, and burnt sugars. Hints of something from the licorice/fennel/aniseed family of herbs...I guess fennel. Burnt blackstrap molasses. Buried scintillae of caramelized sugars.

Seems perfectly attenuated for the style, with a big roasty bitterness balanced by specialty chocolate malts. Seems like a carafa-driven export stout that's impeccably balanced judging by the aroma.

I don't get any coffee-like aromatics, dark fruit, vanilla/vanillin, or actual chocolate (i.e. the chocolate aroma is solely chocolate malt-derived).

Aromatic intensity is average.

TASTE & TEXTURE: Big, roasty, and dry, with a nice undertone of burnt sugars and earthy fennel-like spice. No hop flavours are obvious...maybe some preservative-only herbal hop varietals. Chocolate malt joins with its dark malt backbone to give it some balancing sweetness without usurping the roast at the beer's heart. And the roast is lovely...this beer is chock full of carafa goodness, pleasing the roasted barley lover in all of us.

Has a subtle dryness and coarseness that helps coax out depth of flavour from the carafa/roasted barley without detracting from the gooeyness on the back end that complements the smooth chocolate flavours. Rich without tasting too sweet; robust without being too boozy or harsh. A flirtation with silky softness towards the back end helps surface a brief hint of fudge and chocolate syrup before the roast banishes that sweetness back under its depths.

Carbonation is perfect. Medium to full-bodied, which is apt for the style and this beer's flavour profile.

OVERALL: This is an impeccably balanced export stout with no flaws and few shortcomings...I will say the subtle coffee-like flavour carafa tends to impart is absent here to its slight detriment, and I can't help but imagine some vanillin or vanilla bean flavours would liven it up. But while I can imagine it better with subtle tweaks, I can't find any faults or flaws; it's tremendously well brewed.

Rivals Guinness' export stouts, which is no small feat in my book.

Name: Ola Dubh
Brewery: Harviestoun Brewery
Location: Scotland
Style: English Stout
ABV: 8%
Date: 09/2014
I am drinking Ola Dubh today using a pint glass. I served it at 48 degrees. I did not know this beer was almost ten years old and only at 8%. This has me slightly concerned. The last beer I drank this old was a high-ABV BBA Stout. Prying the cap off, I hear this delightful hiss. Carbonation still exists, which is a good sign. The pour created an airy, creamy, three-fingered, light tan head with above-average retention. The color is dark brown, nearly black, charting around SRM 38. The somewhat slow dissipation left no lacing on the glass. This style's overall appearance is above average, especially being this old. 
The initial aromas are scotch, peat, char oak, and dark roasted malts. There are no off-flavors from what I can smell; this is another good sign. Swirling the glass a few times, I smell herbal, light floral esters( hard to pin down precisely what), robust coffee, light solvent(maybe alcohol), and dark chocolate. The beer smells like an Irish stout but has more depth. I am enjoying the aromas; they are intriguing. 
I am surprised by this beer. The unique flavor compounds tantalize my palate. I am not tasting any of the flavors. This beer is akin to an Irish stout. I taste these huge, malty flavors that are slightly charred: chocolate, toasted grains, caramel, and bready. The beer has an earthy, herbal, and floral dry hop profile. The scotch barrel aging comes through as a complement to the beer. I taste light peat, oak barrels, scotch, and sea air.
The mouthfeel is medium, dry, and slightly astringent. The body is medium, and the carbonation is low. 
These types of beers are why I have this fascination. I love this beer. The harmony and balance is ideal."

Well, I wanted to move up sequentially after trying the 12 and work my way up to the 40, but I ended up finding this one before the 14 & 16. Oh well. I found the 12 a bit strange but overall enjoyable. Let’s crack this one open and see what it’s all about

Pours completely pitch black with a finger of dark tan head that slowly fades to a ring and leaves decent lacing

The fruit really carries this in the nose, and feels like one of those beers that’s intentionally slightly oxidized. I’m picking up on aromas of raisins, dark chocolate, black cherry, light roast coffee, sherry, sweet toffee, earthy whiskey, and light molasses

Wow, this takes a pretty different approach in taste. It still has fruity notes but the roasted malt dominates. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting medium roast coffee, toasted malt, licorice, raisin, earthy whiskey, light vanilla, and toffee. The swallow brings notes of peat smoke, raisin, toasted malt, molasses, black cherry, oak, and light sherry

A medium full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a silky beer. Finishes neutral but a tad boozy

Once again, this is pretty strange, but a really fun kind of strange. I hope to keep trying the others"
4521,Snowcrash000,Ola Dubh Special Reserve 18,4.21,"Pours a pitch-black coloration with a medium, frothy, lasting head. Smells of caramel, slightly roasted malt and strong dark/red fruit notes of plum, fig and red currant, as well as hints of vanilla and musty oak. Taste is an excellent balance of caramel, slightly roasted malt and strong notes of dark fruit and red berries, with notes of plum, fig, red currant and cranberry, as well as hints of honey, vanilla, licorice and musty oak. Finishes with a light sweetness and some plum, red currant and honey lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel with a rich body and light/medium carbonation.

I think that the Sherry casks used for Highland Park are really coming through here quite strongly with some rather distinct dark fruit and red berry notes that certainly lend a certain richness and complexity to this along with lighter honey, vanilla, licorice and oak accents. While I would have wished for a bit more thick mouthfeel here, there's still a good body to this, especially considering the ABV. I would love to try this at full cask strength, but it still makes for a rather complex and well-balanced brew that's a joy to drink."

T- sweet and chocolatey up front, followed by a bright fruity note that adds fresh berries and some ashy malt. The finish gives honey and chocolate, with a linger of caramel and berries, just a hint of peat sticks around on the linger with more charred malt

M- medium body with moderate carbonation leads to a creamy mouthfeel that continues into a silky, velvety finish

4524,DokiDokiLitFam,Ola Dubh Special Reserve 18,3.86,"Pours out a dark brown with a finger of khaki head. I thought this was a stout for a second, seeing the color of this pour. 

Nose is a roasty, acrid, spicy maltiness. Underneath is some toffee and very faint whiffs of dark fruit. Sometimes I get a hint of sweetness on the nose, but in other instances I get nothing but the burnt smelling malt. Almost like burnt toast.

Taste is a little more inviting. That dark bitter malt shows up immediately, but then gives way to the whiskey and mild hints of butterscotch. The roasty bitterness more or less persists throughout the entirety of the tasting. There is some bakers chocolate as well but that burnt toast flavor dominates.

Mouthfeel is standard. Medium bodied with low carbonation. Smooth and easy drinking. 

Overall this is not what I expected. This is a very different Old Ale. I'm not sure where all that bitterness comes from but it feels like I'm drinking an RIS. It honestly feels like it has as much bitterness as an Old Rasputin, but without the stout character. Strange."

Looks pretty good in the glass. Nasty looking jet black body with a persistent tan head which produces a little lacing.

Smells a bit like a well liquored up Olde Englishe fruit cake.

On tasting, the whisky aspect dominates, making it seem farm stronger than the 8abv listed on the can. Quite rich, very warming.

Mouth above medium, finish whisky.

Overall, way too boozy for this palate. I let it warm to see if any other flavors would appear. They did not."
4526,thehyperduck,Ola Dubh Special Reserve 18,4.4,"330 mL bottle from the LCBO; best before Sept 2023 and served barely chilled. I've enjoyed the 12y several times, and the 21y once (half a decade ago), so I was immediately pumped when I stumbled across this variant.

Pours an opaque brownish-black colour, with nearly an inch of foamy, frothy tan-coloured head gathering atop. It rises and falls within a matter of minutes, swiftly reduced to a sudsy collar and some bubbly patches on the surface - lookin' good, with sticky spots of lacing left behind as you swirl and/or sip it. Smells rich and luxurious - I'm getting fudge, molasses and caramel blended together with whisky, raisin, oak and vanilla; subtle hints of peat smoke and coffee, too. I could've easily kept sniffing this for ten minutes - it's just that mouth-watering.

So good. Rich dark chocolate, overripe plum and fudge flavours, with toffee, molasses and dark, dried fruit flavours reminiscent of raisin and date. The whisky comes through more on the back end, lending a touch of peat smokiness, oak, vanilla and sherry before a mildly warming aftertaste, with fudge, molasses and raisin lingering on. Medium-full in body, with low carbonation that weakly nudges the surface of the palate; feels silky-smooth, but perhaps a touch thinner than I'd prefer from this sort of beer. Even still, I enjoyed it so much that I almost forgot I was reviewing it at times, and nearly ran out liquid before I'd finished - a sure sign of an impressive ale.

Final Grade: 4.4, a fantastic A grade. Ola Dubh Special Reserve 18 might just be my favourite edition so far, though I suppose I'd need to try the 12, 18 and 21 side-by-side to know for sure. It'd certainly be an expensive comparative ranking... but oh man, would my taste buds be overloaded by the end of the night. Satisfied, too - these remain some of my absolutely favourite Scottish beers, and I will continue to encourage BAs to purchase them on sight. Don't let the price tags deter you, they're worth it."

4529,AlfromPA,Black Butte Porter,3.9,"An outstanding porter; one certainly cannot fault it for lacking flavor. It has fine body, a very dark color, and wonderful aroma.

Thick fizzy tan head simmering down to a thin glaze with slightly more pronounced ring. Smells of bread, coffee, and dark chocolate.

T= The taste is more robust than the smell. Here the smoke is balance nicely with malt, coffee notes, and hops. A salty aftertaste lingers. Delicious!

Taste is mroe sweet chocolate, light roast, earthy coffee, definitely unique and like lightly sweetened coffee/or heavy black tea. 

Mouthfeel is lower carbonation, moderate sweetness, lower bitterness; some see this as a sweeter beer but feel the bitterness is just very light. 

Overall uniquely English Porter - lighter perceived bitterness allows for sweeter presence at this abv - want this on cask."
4541,Ernald_Elbertson,Taddy Porter,3.41,"English Porters aren't the most common style in the States, and I guess I'm not that surprised based on this. 

While it looks very pretty with a big creamy head and dark ruby coloration, it doesn't impress so much with the aroma and flavor. Mild coffee aroma with a hint of sweet chocolate. Slightly roasty, but not dominating. Generally just pretty light on flavor, dry and a bit watery. I've had plenty of better Porters in the same ABV range that brought a lot more flavor and intrigue to the table. I'd even prefer a Dark Mild at this point, the flavors are similar but those are made for sessions. 

Feel saves it a bit, pretty nice mouthfeel, creamy and soft, especially right after pouring. Overall I really expected more based on the ratings here. It's nothing offensive, but I would probably never buy again."

This style is one of my least favorites but when I drink a world-class example, I immediately know. And this is quickly evident upon taking a few gulps. Perfectly balanced malt bill and yeast qualities without being overly spiced. Creamy, smooth, satisfying. What a beer!"
4551,Vlad11,Ayinger Bräuweisse,4.33,"very interesting. feels the typical wheat taste is more subtle, refined, it has almost champagne like quality, reminds of saison, or even NE ipa (nelson hops). taste is pears, green apples, vanilla, a hint of cloves and banana. slightly bitter and dry end. medium body at max. different and very nice"
4552,cjgiant,Ayinger Bräuweisse,4.3,"On tap:
Cloudy to a high degree, but not perfectly blocking all light. Lovely uniform white cap promotes a lot of initial lacing. Feel is a bit light and bubbly and not quite as smooth as I expected. Taste is a dialed down version of the nose, which is heavy on a mix of not too ripe banana and spice. As I sip, I appreciate the balance in the more and more, as it is pretty even-keeled while still exhibiting the qualities the style is known for."
4553,ATL6245,Ayinger Bräuweisse,4.62,"Appearance: Cloudy straw yellow. White creamy, mousse-like head with good retention.

Aroma: Banana, clove and grassy/herbal notes.

Flavor and aftertaste: Yeasty flavors. Spicy hops. Restrained bitterness.

Mouthfeel: Medium to light bodied. Soft feel. Moderate carbonation. Dry finish.

Overall: Excellent hefeweizen. Has all the expected hallmarks of a German made hefe. Detected a grassy, herbal note that I have not in most German made versions, which added to the interest. Short drying finish. Well crafted."
4554,solok,Terrible,4.69,"Deep, dark color. Limited head sticks around. Smells like gingerbread. Flavor also has some molasses, like pfeffernüsse. Nice little ethanol burn balances it out. Spice flavor reminiscent of Christmas ales. Port-like consistency. Light effervescence."
4555,Whyteboar,Terrible,4.45,"My bottle was “best before 1/18/2018” so I am not going to write much of a review until I get a fresher one to get a better idea of what they intended.
But even almost 7 years after the best by date, this is still seriously good."
4556,Grax,Terrible,4.41,"The aroma gives off a thick and pungent smell reminiscent of molasses, cherry, and some spice. The flavor is strong and follows the smell very well, with cherry-esque malt, molasses, and some spice punctuating the body. It's creamy and smooth. Overall, a very flavorful and smooth beer, very enjoyable to drink."
4557,RamonaBeer,Terrible,5,A delightful beer that I really enjoyed - and will get again!
4558,DFred,Terrible,4.25,"Dark brown pour and light brown head, it presents itself beautifully in the glass. The aroma is a mix of yeast, dark fruits, and spices, with a strong caramel and candied sugar scent. The taste follows the aroma, with strong figs and dates, caramel, and candied sugar. The beer is full-bodied yet highly carbonated, making it smooth and easy to drink. Despite its high alcohol content, it is well-balanced and the alcohol warmth is pleasant. The complexity of flavors and excellent mouthfeel make this a truly wonderful beer. It is a measuring stick for other Quads."
4559,scott451,Terrible,4.16,"Poured a 341ml bottle into a chalice. A one finger fine tan head on black. Excellent head retention and some thin lacing.
Subtle spice and esters in the nose.
Dark fruit. Chocolate. A extremely mild hop finish.
Very smooth. Medium body. low carbonation.
An awesome quad. Somewhat subdued but well worth a try."
4560,AlexandraDen,Terrible,4.19,"These days I dont have much time to write reviews, but still want to put up some thoughts. Tons of people do in depth on look, smell, etc... Others do nice long proce. I think I might try to do nice, concise, in between reviews without reiterating what others say.

Didn't know this was a Quad! I think the 10.5% is a nice middle line for Quads (many often much higher). 

A nice deep brown colour with ruby shade, with a lighter, washed out brown frothy head just around a finger with greath thickness and retention. Floral smells sure but malty sweetness, sweet bread, raisin and mild spice notes on the nose.

A lovely mix of flavours somewhere between malt, sweet bread, and others. Opens with a great wooden flavour, kind of like oak but a little more mustiness to it. A big of dark chocolate but not particularly strong, did note some dried fruits, almost like cranberry-raisin mix. Yeasty flavours but not chewy like other quads or even other tripels. Spice is there but muted. Slight medicinal aspects on the finish with brown sugar, but not in the sweet way, more like the way where the sweetness ends and the mild brown sugar flavours lie on the tongue after a minute. 

Good carbonation, higher than expected, dense tiny bubbles. Smooths out over time, body is medium and not too thick whatsoever. Lighter bodied than you'd think, more carbonation than you'd think as well. Very unique little balance. Alcohol is well hidden... When it's cold. As it warms, even just a little, you feel it a bit more on the exhale. Not overwhelming, and it opens up the flavour to be a little sweeter, a little bit more sweetness, a little more spice and fruit like mild cinnamon and plum/raisin, and rum like notes. Great, unique Quadrupel. It's not a malt bomb, it's not dessert like or super sweet, it's not super thick, and there's some mild balancing bitterness here. Very interesting!"
4561,Broman,Terrible,4.42,"Poured from a bottle

Appearance - Grand frothy light brown head sits atop a dark pop body. When held to the light the body has a red mahogany color to it with nice clarity. Head stays with the beer throughout the enjoyment of it and nice even lacing lines the glass. 

Aroma - Citrus fruits and sweet floral. Great Quadruple smell.

Taste - No alcohol on the tongue, Belgian yeast and subdued sweet fruits, complex smooth and enjoyable, slight malty/ brown sugary thickness lingers in the back of the throat

Mouthfeel - Lighter than expected, mild carbonation 

Overall - Absolutely enjoyable beer to drink. Checks all the boxes in my opinion of a great Quadruple."
4562,hman43,Terrible,4.2,"Look: It pours dark brown with a light brown colored head. It has excellent head retention. 

Smell: It has a strong fruity aroma up front with plums and prunes. There are some perfumy and rose like nots with very low spice. 

Taste: It has strong fruitness in the flavor with plums and prunes. The fruity impression makes it sweet overall. There are some caramel notes with rose like and wine like qualities. 

Feel: It has a medium full body with strong, but pleasant alcohol warming. 

Overall, strong alcohol and complex flavors makes this a wonderful, yes strong beer."
4563,Sigmund,Avec Les Bons Voeux,3.93,"750 ml corked & caged bottle, from Vinmonopolet, Nettbutikken. ABV is 9.5%. Slightly hazy golden colour, huge white head. Aroma of spicy Belgian ale yeast, white kandij sugar syrup and spicy hops. The same spicy notes in the flavour, also sufficient malts, hints of yellow plums, not too sweet, bitter finish. Refreshing for its strength."
4564,Ushouldbeworkinh,Avec Les Bons Voeux,3.75,"Nice saison. Farmhouse flavour, malty, spicy. Had no clue it was so strong, really hides it with the dry finish. Feels close to Westlake triple honestly"
4565,Lucular,Avec Les Bons Voeux,4.06,"10 oz snifter draft pour at Frisco Taphouse in Crofton, MD. The description is pretty accurate - notes of banana, lemon, clove, and Belgian yeast esters. Fairly sweet and also boozy. I agree that this is edging towards being a tripel - which is not really what I want when I drink a saison. I like saisons to be more on the delicate side, and this is definitely not a delicate beer. Still a good beer, just...well, I am tempted to say it's not true to style, but this is Brasserie Dupont we're talking about. So, I won't say it."
4566,Wattie83,Avec Les Bons Voeux,4.35,"Poured from 750 Ml bottle to a chalice glass. Poured beautiful gold color with a white head on top that didn't go away. Lively body with carbonation throughout. Smell was grainy, apples and cinnamon, funky, earthy tones. Taste starts a bit sweet with bread and grain. Then the earthy funk kicks in with yeast and straw/grassy flavors. Finish is rather dry and the funk lingers. Feel is light and bubbly as the carbonation keeps it alive. A crisp dry finish is the perfect end. Overall, this is great sipper with a lot of interesting flavor. I'd buy this again for sure."
4567,HattedClassic,Avec Les Bons Voeux,4.43,"The beer pours a voluminous white and fluffy head that takes a while to dissipate while the beer itself is a clear metallic amber color that looks very good.

The smell is delicious. It has a mix of fruity notes and light bread notes mixed with an earthy bitterness from the hops.

The taste is fantastic. The Belgian spice notes dominate the taste at first, but the apple and pear notes come in rather quickly without displacing the yeast notes. There is also a light caramel taste to it as well. While the beer starts sweet, it starts to become more bitter than sweet quickly. The earthy bitter hop notes come out towards the finish to round out the beer.

The feel is amazing! It starts off with a bit of stickiness before becoming fairly dry! The carbonation is tingling while the texture is fluffy smooth with a medium body to it.

Overall, this is a fantastic beer worth getting and having if available."
4568,MikeWard,Avec Les Bons Voeux,4.19,The progression from refreshingly sweet to drying and somewhat bitter is very enjoyable
4569,AzfromOz,Avec Les Bons Voeux,4.49,"Purchased from the international Beer Collector Christmas sale in November 2021 and drunk in July 2022.

The beer comes in a sturdy-looking, green, corked bottle. There's a satisfying pop and hiss as the cork is pryed loose followed by a whiff of ""smoke"" and an immediate orchard fruit scent at the neck of the bottle.

On the nose, as previewed at the opening, there's peach and apricot, spicy yeast, vanilla and pepper. Wow, I've not even had it in my mouth and I can tell it's going to be something complex and special.

In the mouth, spicy Belgian yeast dominates at first, but the orchard fruits quickly announce their presence. There also the vanilla from the nose and bitter orange peel and candied lemon. At the swallow there is substantial, earthy bitterness that's quite sharp and not at all what I was expecting. The finish is dry but the bitterness lingers long after the swallow. 

Mouthfeel is luxurious. It's smooth and counteracts the lingering bitterness well. There's quite a bit of carbonation, but the sweetness, bitterness and bubbles all work together seemlessly. A follow-up mouthfeel demands attention.

Overall, this is a magnificent beer. There's complexity that isn't always evident in saisons or farmhouse ales, which takes the beer beyond the standard Belgian yeast, lemon candy and pepper/herbal profile that those styles can fall back on. I can't remember a better saison or farmhouse ale and in fact can't remember too many better beers full stop.

Cheers!"

4579,colts9016,Oud Beersel Oude Kriek Vieille,4.25,"Review 1538
My continuation for trying a bunch of different beers. This beer is a fruit lambic I picked up a month or so back. The beer is 46 degrees and served in a tulip glass. The pour of the beer created a two-fingered pinkish head with excellent retention. The head did not leave any lacing on the glass as it slowly dissipated. The head is creamy and foamy and settling to the bottom of the liquid. The color of the beer is 0reddish-purple with clarity. 

The first aromas in the beer are cherries, lightly toasted malts, and sour lemons. Nosing further, I detect a touch of horse blanket, wet grass, toasted crackers, oak, and hay. 

The flavors in the beer are cherries, fruity sweetness, oak, leather, a touch of farmyard funk, sourness like lemons, toasted crackers, hay, and lightly toasted malts. 

The mouthfeel of the beer is tannic, tart, and carbonated. 

The body of the beer is light, high carbonation, and medium finish. 

The beer has a beautiful tartness and finished crisp. The fruit comes through but is not overpowering. The touch of farmyard funk is pleasant and gives the beer uniqueness. Solid fruit lambic, I enjoyed it."
4580,MonDak_Joe1953,Oud Beersel Oude Kriek Vieille,4.4,"750ml green bottle. Caged and corked bottle. Label lists ABV% as 6, for ""Belgian Cherry Ale"".
Dark reddish brown colored body. Slightly pink, beige colored head, which persists as a thin bubble cap. Just a few small spots of lacing left behind.
Aroma has cherry and oak/leather farmyard funk.
Taste is a balance of cherry sweet and tart. The funk is more in the later portion, and shows oak, lemon, and leather. The more tart cherry and oak revisit in the aftertaste.
Medium mouth feel, with a dry finish. Good carbonation.
Sublime and balanced use of the cherry with the base lambic. All works together and nothing out of place."

O: A big drinkable and flavorful Imperial Stout. Overall quite good."
4584,Sabtos,Fayston Maple Imperial Stout,4.15,"Glossy mahogany with a dense, creamy tan head of moderate height, slowly settling to a bubbly collar.

Smell is roastier, more savory and chocolatey of nutty cacao with only a hint of maple drizzled coffee bean.

Taste, too, contains plenty of roasty, peanutty malt, quite enough to even recall Hoppin Frog qualities. Only a mild, faint hint of maple blossoms in the finish, bringing with it a touch of banana skin, which I also remember detecting in the coffee version I had years ago. 

The fluffy medium body finishes absolutely paper dry."
4585,SmashAdams,Fayston Maple Imperial Stout,4.25,It's nice to see a big stout that's not barrel aged. This is a pretty easy drinker considering the 10.1% ABV and that's probably because of the light sweetness coming through from the maple. Very tasting but not overpowering. yb
4586,Prospero,Hel & Verdoemenis,4.42,"Classic russian imperial stout notes of medium-roast coffee or smooth espresso, slight bitterness like bittersweet chocolate (but not astringent) and light tannic properties from the bourbon barrel aging.

Taste is really complex with layers of flavors each coming at a different point, small notes of dark fruit & tobacco at the end but not prominent.

Was a jet black pour, like smooth, dark crude oil. Had a short, frothy, rich mocha-hued head. Lacing left behind was solid! Nose was a mix of dark choco, cocoa, espresso, raisins and some currants. Body was medium to medium-plus, and it was quite smooth.

Taste had nice dark malts, with dark choco, more espresso and cocoa, and some roasty action. It was a touch dry, with some floral notes in the finish. Goes down soooo nicely - mmmmm!! Prosit!

It’s toasty but not overly, a tad chocolate from the chocolate malt, a barley thing going on. Then there is a bit of bitterness on the end from the saaz hop and some yeastiness and coffee flavor. Some subtle dark fruit and tobacco notes. Oil black and viscous looking with just a bit of beige foam around the rim. Smells like water and roasted malts. Dry.

Aromas of rich dark chocolate and coffee, no bitterness or acidity, and baked dried fruit cake; comforting.
Wow delicious - tastes like real hot chocolate (melted bars), dark and rich, with just the right amount of balancing bitterness and light acidity keeping the palate fresh and excited; light hints of dark fruit - cassis and blackberry; feel is soft and velvety, lingering for days on the tongue; low carbonation, medium-full body

Beautifully done, superbly balanced, delicious sophisticated flavour. So many imperial stouts are overly sweet, this keeps the sugar to minimum while still remaining rich and appropriately bitter."

4595,Fordcoyote15,Hel & Verdoemenis,4.74,"Look is nice but heavily carbonated.

Smell is stellar. It smells so fucking familiar but I cant put my finger on it. Im getting memory triggers to bells 35th anniversary expedition stout more than anything. I can definitely smell the against the grain bo & luke influence as well. 
Roasty, smokey, toasted grains, ash. Damn incredible aromas.

Taste is oh my God good. My tastes have matured greatly in the past few years and I once wouldn't have appreciated this as I do now. It's incredibly bitter from so many angles. Burnt toast and nightshift black coffee thats been on the burner for hours are forefront. Now lick the ashy crust of an oak smoked pork shoulder while chewing on some pure unsweetened cacao and you've 99% described this beer. Incredible. I would have drain poured this 5 or 10 years ago but these days the depth and richness of these dark flavors are hitting me like a drug. This is one of the best sippers I've had in years.

Feel is world class. I let it warm up to just about room temperature and its dense and oily as can be.

Overall. A $10 beer worth so much more if you appreciate the following: non adjunct beers, smoked beers/rauchbiers, and wrecking your palate for hours."

L: clear, ruby-colored liquid with vinous-violet highlights; little pop on the cork removal, little foam build on pour... the foam breaks down quick, leaving little collar; almost looks still

S: cherry hard candy perfumy aromatics, but not suggesting sweetness; that mixed with a barrel-funky champagne tone... fruit leather, earthy rain-soaked terrain, hint of fruit tart (pastry, dough), fringe of smoky phenolics

T: mmm, much fruitier than the aromas let on, cherry and red grape, some dark plum as well, lingering dried red fruit in the dry aftertaste, much more malt depth as well... the fruit portion of this is relatively bloated, leaving the dying vitality of the lambic a touch buried; the expressions at this age are mature but still have character

F: nearly still as far as carbonation... smudgy light-medium body, subtle acidic singe at the back of the palate... a sipper; too easy

O: this may have lost a good portion of its zest and zip, but it's still a lovely, demure drop; basically drinks like an acidic, near smoky, moderately bright-fruity, medium-bodied wine; lacking the boozy cut of a standard-strength vino... at this stage, it's still tasty, but it doesn't compare to the standard Mariage Parfait in flavor impact, and I had a 2014 bottle of that recently (2228)"

On tasting, cherries much stronger than suggested by the nose. Tart without being drying, fairly sour, a touch of wood.

Nose is oak, must, wine lees, cherry and cherry wood, mild lactic notes. Much of the fruit has sapped out of this over the years - there's an initial hit of sourness at the start, but tannic oak takes over rather quickly and sticks through to the finish. What is there of the fruit registers as sour cherry (I'd also buy raspberry), but it's far in the background. Feel is great - so very smooth and drinkable, the only thing keeping me from drinking quarts of the stuff is price. Would like to have fresh version to drink alongside to see how much the fruit is meant to shine."
4601,Sheppard,Boon Oude Kriek Mariage Parfait,4.03,"2011 vintage bottle. 2033 best before date so guessing this is a 2013 release. 

Pours a kind of deep purple with red hues. Kind of in that Coca Cola/Dr Pepper meets Dimetapp grape vein in color. That classic musty cherry character on the nose. Even after all of this time, it's incredibly fruit forward. The cherry character is sweeter than I anticipated. Having this, I'm wanting to get some Intense Red some time soon. This has moderate levels of acidity and funk. Overall, it's pleasant to drink, but I feel like there's less lambic character than I would like."

Malty sweet aroma with notes of honey, sweet yellow fruits and yeast. Encouraging to taste.

4608,elnachooo,Moinette Blond,3.75,"Cerveza de color ámbar, con un dedo espumoso de retención media. De cuerpo y carbonatación media. Aroma a levadura, banana y caramelo. En boca tiene un poco mas de amargor pero bien matizada con un final dulce."
4609,JonnoWillsteed,Moinette Blond,4.18,"Blind-tasted except for the beer's name and brewery/country, zero reviews below read (yet!)…
L- Dark golden with a hint of amber. Pours with moderate haze; some encrusted sediment left in the bottle. 2Cm pillowy off-white head.
S- Aromatic leathery timber. Ie. Belgian estery yeast notes. 
T- The smell follows through directly into the taste. The estery notes are now clear - they often remind me of the smell of sweets called Pear Drops we enjoyed as children. Plenty of bright hops into the finish to balance thing out too.
F- It's a good solid beer. The estery notes are really prominent; it would be a great case study if you wanted to demo such to someone unfamiliar with them. 
O- I like it. Mega-esters popping right on your palate. Bright, interesting and balanced flavour. Solid and meaty and yet not even a hint my palate is going to get jaded by this. 60% gone now and the head is still right there holding up at 1Cm+. I reckon this is versatile too. Works great in winter (it's snowing out in London/UK today!), bright enough for a summer's eve. Robust enough to pair with solidly flavoured food incl spicy food.
Review/scoring all done, now the reveal, I get to read the bottle lables to see what I missed! ==> Bottle-conditioned, 8.5%ABV, it was politely discreet about the latter.
330ml bottle £4.15 BB: 10/23 Bought from BelgianBeerCompany, Stoke/UK as part of a large pick-your own consignment to London."
4610,Sigmund,Moinette Blond,3.81,"330 ml bottle, Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 8.5%. Hazy golden colour, moderate white head. Strong fruity and spicy aroma of Belgian ale yeast. Spicy and yeasty flavour, medium sweet, with notes of white kandij sugar and stewed fruits. Moderate hops."
4611,Guaro,Moinette Blond,3.79,"Gold-colored, veiled and with orange reflections. White foam with medium texture, compact and excellent grip. Perfume, bread, pear, citrus, candied sugar, ginger, spices and herbaceous. On the palate a light sweet entry, biscuit and yellow-fleshed fruit, the finish is dry with a bitter aftertaste with spicy and herbaceous notes. Hidden abv. Medium body and high carbonation."
4612,GingerFinn,Moinette Blond,4.02,"Delightful. My first strong Belgian pale I think. I usually go for Strong Dark, Dubbels, and Quads. This tastes similar, but a tad lighter with a touch more bitterness. Nicely sweet, and paired well with a roast duck dinner. It was better as it warmed up, I think I had it too cold initially. No hint of the 8.5%."
4613,thehyperduck,Moinette Blond,4.23,"330 mL bottle from the LCBO; best before Aug 2022 and served at cellar temperature.

Pours a bright, clear golden-yellow hue, producing just over a finger of foamy, sparkling white head. It withers away over the next several minutes, leaving behind a thin cap and wide, frothy collar, with a narrow band of lace also having been deposited. I'm getting orchard fruits and yeastiness on the nose - appleskin, clove and white pepper, with hints of banana, pear and candi sugar sweetness, all layered atop of a bready pale malt backdrop. Not bad at all.

A quality Belgian strong ale; the flavours follow the nose, with grainy, bready pale malts providing support for notes of apple, white grape, apricot and pear. Hints of lemony citrus and bubblegum crop up as well, with yeasty, spicy aspects of clove towards the finish, and just a tad of floral hops & earthiness into the aftertaste. Medium-full in body, with moderate carbonation levels that froth up in the mouth a little, gently tickling the tongue; feels smooth and velvety soft in the mouth. The 8.5% is a tad noticeable, but not in an intrusive way, as it blends into the profile quite effectively. If it weren't for the small serving size, this might be a much more dangerous beer, particularly given the ease with which I tossed it back.

Final Grade: 4.23, an excellent A-. Moinette Blonde is a very solid BSPA that I enjoyed the hell out of. Now, I don't know if I'd put it on the same pedestal as Duvel, but in terms of quality it's at least in the vicinity of that ballpark. The stock around here is beginning to dwindle, but hopefully I'll manage to pick up another bottle or two for short term (less than 2 y) storage in the cellar. Highly recommended to any BA with an appreciation for Belgian pale ales."
4614,andaub,Moinette Blond,3.77,"This is a refreshing beer, you taste the belgium style, slight hops, light citrus malt aroma, smooth to the pallet, and a nice aftertaste. This is a great Belgium pale ale and probably one of the better ones I've had. Definitely a summer drink and dangerous for 8.5 ABV."
4615,Cramshawbar,Moinette Blond,3.95,"The look is lovely Belgian and the nose is equally good funky saison. But the taste is somewhat disappointing. It's a bit fizzy, haltingly dry and just an overall weaker sister of St. Feuillien Grand Cru, to which this seems to inspire but cannot reach. Really, you could do worse if nothing is available in its class. Otherwise....meh."
4616,JokersAce,Weissbier Hell,4.19,"Better than I thought it would be. Nice light yellow opaque color that's so cloudy it's strangely dark, white lacing. Nice breadiness here. Plentiful banana bread and a thick lively feel. It's like sipping on a banana bread milkshake. Definitely a nice spice character here with plenty of a clove characteristic and I think I can taste the alcohol in a spicy way, in addition to a sort of light citrus vanilla. There actually is noticeable yeast component here in the after sip, though not my favorite I suppose it's what creates the flavor profile of this style. Pretty good."

4618,AzfromOz,Weissbier Hell,4.3,"Drunk fresh at the beautiful, awe-inspiring source in September 2023.

L: Thick, mango-juice orange, with a bright white, initially large but quickly disappearing, head. Lots of carbonation.

S: Cloves, weisbier yeastiness, coriander and a slight cinnamon note. Very nice. 

T: Mirroring the nose, but with an added note of apricot and orchard fruit. Very refreshing

M: Soft and pillowy. 

O: Drunk fresh at the site, so gets extra marks for the ambience, but a delicious weisbier nonetheless.

Very pleasant. All the best attributes of hefeweizen are present. The best thing however is really short sharp finish, a bit bitter, which balances the sweetness. Arguably the best hefeweizen I tried."
4624,Gatch,Weissbier Hell,4.59,"Enjoying a half liter in their Braustuberl, which is pretty packed for a German holiday weekend but also surprisingly touristy. Much busier in the food and beer lines compared to Weihenstephaner and much larger outdoor seating area with a similar a la carte ordering system. This is I think the last major beer from them I haven’t tried so I was happy to order it. Super hazy, yeasty, and funky. Not too heavy on the banana and other typical Hefe flavors which is why I like this so much. This brewery is popular for a reason and their beer is seriously consistent."
4625,defunksta,Weissbier Hell,4.25,"Appearance: Pours a mostly clear, light golden color with a largewhite head. SRM of 8. (4.00)

Aroma: Strong aromas of orange citrus, bubblegum, light floral notes with her bready yeast. (4.00)

Flavor: Strong flavors of orange citrus, bubble gum, banana bread. Some yeast, clove, and spice and then dry on the end. A light bite on the finish, but overall smooth. (4.25)

Feel: Medium-bodied, strong carbonation. Bready, soft, and smooth. (4.50)

Compared to Ayinger Brauweisse 4/2023: Pours similar, similar head. Similar aromas with slightly more orange citrus and less cloves. More orange citrus and flower on the flavor. Slightly cleaner and smoother and less rich and spiced than Ayinger. Similar though.

Compared to Andechs Weissbier Dunkel 4/2023: Pours lighter, milder head. Stronger aromas. More bubblegum, rich bread and sweet banana. Less dry grains, brown bread. Sweeter. 

Compared to Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier 5/2023: Pours darker, similar head. Milder aromas. More sweet German bread malt/spice and banana bread. Less citrus, flower, and yeastiness. Slighter sweeter and more bready. 
11/2023: Slightly more bread and malty. Less yeast and flower crispness. Similar. 

Overall: An excellent Hefeweizen. Smooth bready malts with light orange citrus and flower with a classic yeasty finish. Some sweet banana bread. Slightly smoother and less rich than Ayinger. Incredibly smooth and complex, yet still all the things of a Hefeweizen. Very similar to Weihenstephaner which is the GOAT. Slightly more bready and smooth, but similar. (Rating: 4.25)"

4630,bluejacket74,White,4.27,"12 ounce bottle, thanks to Brutaltruth for this! Served in a Teku, the beer pours a slightly hazy pale gold color with about an inch frothy white head. Head retention and lacing are both pretty good. I like the aroma, the brew smells like coriander, orange peel, wheat/grainy malt and some bubblegum. Taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but with the addition of some banana. No one flavor overpowers the others. Mouthfeel/body is light, it's smooth and has a good amount of soft zippy carbonation. Refreshing and easy to drink! Thought this was a good overall brew, definitely worth trying!"
4631,TooManyGlasses,White,4.22,"8 ounce pour at Allagash in Portland, Maine - a must!
Hazy pale straw pour with solid finger bubbly white head.
Aroma is a bit fruity and spicy - orange, juicy fruit gum, a touch of clove.
Taste follows with crackery malt, orange, lemon drop, a bit of clove, and a touch peppery - sweet and spicy.
Medium mouthfeel - soft and smooth, nicely carbonated with a crisp finish."

Will convert anyone on the fence about beer, and will satisfy anyone who already knows what good beer tastes like. Literally perfect."

Best by 12/29/24

Cloudy copper brown pour with an ample khaki head. Foam is creamy and leaves a bit of lace. The nose is super malty and loaded with sweet indicating aromas of dried cherry, chocolate and dark sugars. The taste is more attenuated than the nose indicates but still malty, rich and a bit sweet, with candied sugars, chocolate malts, spices, and hints of herbal orange. Light medium in weight and pretty smooth, it has a light creaminess and becomes thicker feeling as it warms. Really enjoying this one."
4634,TheYeasticandoo,Abbey Ale,4.44,"Tastes like a nice Belgian Dubbel to me. I was hoping for stronger aroma, but the taste makes up for it. I was surprised to actually pick out a little licorice taste at first, but very subtle and blended in nicely as you go, along with the slight orange and the requisite fig and date flavor, which is what I love about Belgian Dubbels. Overall a very nice authentic tasting Dubbel Ale at a decent price. Well Done! Sign me up!"

f) Never cloying, sweet but cleans up nicely, lovely, lively tongue feel. 
o) Outstanding and next to Belgians"
4638,milkshakebeersucks,Abbey Ale,4.34,"Solid copper appearance with a large tan head and good lacing. Malty aroma serves as a backdrop for an array of dark, ripe fruit. Complex taste rolling out notes of ripe fruit, licorice, seasonal spices and caramel. Alcohol a bit more noticeable in the aftertaste. Medium-to-full bodied, moderately carbonated mouthfeel leading to a dry, spicy finish."
4639,Newtobeet345,Abbey Ale,4.39,"I love Belgian style beer and like golden monkey, Abbey Ale delivers

Color is ruby, with a great head upon the pour. I smelled figs and currant. The taste very much the same.

Had Neon Rainbows from the same producer and have learned if they do one great most are great. There a few exceptions"
4640,Scotchboy,Duchesse De Bourgogne,3.53,"Bottled in 2019, pours out an effervescent dull reddish-brown with ample off-khaki head. More sweet than most Flanders Reds I've had...certainly there is some vinegar-y tartness and impressions of lemon, but the caramel and dark sugary malt sweetness leads. Interesting."
4641,Larryken,Duchesse De Bourgogne,4.81,"Wonderful cherry aroma, smooth and well balanced flavor. I am a Rodenbach fan and this brew reminds me of Alexander. Very dark red color and this is a beer worth seeking out. Been enjoying on tap from my local."
4642,Shiredave,Duchesse De Bourgogne,4.3,"The Duchess is the refined Grand Dame of sours.
Dark and still with a faint wisps of foam.
Rich dark fruit aromas of cherries and pear mix with sour apple cider vinegar sharpness.
The flavor follows - tart and fruity with a malt depth underneath that carries the sour character giving it heft and balance.
Finish is dry and tart with lingering apple rind notes.
When ""fresh"" ie. properly conditioned this can be stellar."
4643,Bobbisu245,Duchesse De Bourgogne,2.18,"I wanted to love it. Love sours and all kinds of fruit beers but this was not my cup of tea. Looked wonderful but one whiff of the rotten apple smell put me off. Thought OK smell isn’t great but taste had to be better. NOPE! As bad as I didn’t like the smell I liked that more than the taste. To me tasted like what I would envision nail polish remover tasting like. Hubby didn’t agree with my acetone comparison, but he too thought that it was just not good."
4644,Drop_The_L,Duchesse De Bourgogne,4.74,"Opulent.

Bright acidity balanced with medium carbonation make this beautiful palette cleansing opener. Bright cherry and balsamic vinegar on the nose wish a dash of barnyard funk. Tart cherry notes evolve into a sweet (but not overly so) balsamic vinegar finish that just begs for another sip. Those who resist will enjoy the long, lavish finish. 
Enjoy with wild game or short ribs. 

Served in a Burgundy glass at around 50 degrees Fahrenheit."
4645,JohnniEMc,Duchesse De Bourgogne,4.6,"The brew is solid dark brown, more dull than shiny and opaque. A good deal of light is required to catch a reddish tint. This serving was drawn from a tap and presented in a clear pint glass. On top lays the most marginal of heads that's sort of biege. It brings those Belgian smells of yeast, malt, alcohol and some hops. The initial taste is a sweet and sour blast, more sweet until, as it finishes, a vinegar-like presence is detected. It's an enjoyable transition. Overall, this is malty big, with not much bite from the hops. That makes the sourness even more appreciated. There's much less alcohol to taste as there was in the aroma. Thankfully, the oak tannins don't turn this into something that tastes like a boilermaker. Even without a head, nor glass lacing, this looks good, especially since it went down so rich and smoothly. Perhaps it will take having a sweet tooth to love this one."
4646,Sigmund,Palate Wrecker,3.94,"Shared 12 fl. oz. bottle, kindly provided by abemorsten. ABV is 9.5%. Hazy orange colour, large white head. Strong aroma of orange marmalade and fruity and resinous American hops. The flavour is indeed a ""palate wrecker"" - that is why this beer was chosen as the last beer of the evening at our tasting. Extremely hoppy flavour, but still, in its own weird way, fairly ""well balanced"" - mainly because the malty sweetness seems just right. to stand up to the hoppiness. Grapefruit, resin / pine and spruce. Yes, it is a ""typically American double IPA"", and I’ve ""seen it before""- but still: Oh so GOOD! Halleluja!"

Smells strongly of high grade marijuana.

Taste is of grapefruit and great ganja. Booze is present but not overpowering. 

A delicious beer."
4649,Bluerabbitbell,Palate Wrecker,4.06,"Good solid imperial IPA. Not up there with the best, but nice and solid. In tap at Industry Public House on Leah's b-day weekend in Pittsburgh! Good ending for lunch!

4652,MNJR,Imperial Stout,5,"Rich and satisfying with the unmistakable Tadcaster magic that cannot be duplicated, ever. In the history of beer, with the physical, spiritual, and human limitations of the art form of making beer, nothing can ever be better than this, So... this is it, The Best. Try to outdo it, try and fail, maybe someday a stout beer can be better, maybe, but maybe not. Delicious flavors of earth, raisin, cocoa, fruit, vanilla, brown sugar, forest, mountains, and sea. Best stuff, best you can get. Lovely and remarkable in every way a beer can possibly be. 100%. Something has to be, and this is it."
4653,Tom-o-Bedlam,Imperial Stout,4.42,"Burnt coffee, bitter dark chocolate, toasted bready malt, and hops on the back end. 

Has the same undefinable funkiness that all Samuel Smith beers have (I’m drinking this one after having their Oatmeal Stout, Tadcaster, and Organic Chocolate Stout earlier this week). I guess it’s the well water. 

There’s something hard and mineral-y that undergirds the flavor and the feel. 

Good stuff."

4655,Siriusfisherman,Northern Hemisphere Harvest Wet Hop IPA,4.65,"What was once a relatively easy find, is now one of the rarest treats in the brewing industry. This ale is the pinnacle of the floral, pine/citrus hop character that old school Sierra Nevada IPAs exhibit. Notes of earthy pine resin, grapefruit and peach dominate with a drying burnt sugar, caramel malt backbone that balances out the bitterness. No one makes beer like this anymore, which makes it so special when you find it."

M: medium bodied and slightly crisp and refreshing.
O: nice feel and taste combo; pretty good overall.."
4657,JohnniEMc,Northern Hemisphere Harvest Wet Hop IPA,4.43,"It is a beautiful pour from a tap into a clear pint glass. Dark copper-amber in color, it also brings with it a modest and enduring light biege head. It's mildly aromatic, with solid earthy and malty notes. That also describes the flavor, which is malty enough to provide a little sweetness and a decent body. The hops add flavor without being overly bitter. This is truly a wet hopped IPA. Earthy throughout the drinking experience, even the finish doesn’t approach the expected IPA hoppy dryness. Not that this lacks a good bitter hop inclusion, it's there, just well balanced by a really good malt body."
4658,Specialmick,Northern Hemisphere Harvest Wet Hop IPA,3.76,"Look... brown, brown, brown, copper and with ample carbonation and a white head. transparent
Smell...nonexistent light hop citrus with some maltiness
Taste...Resinous , slick, peppery but none of the kind of fresh hop experience that lagunitas has with their wet hop. Good but for me very reminiscent of celebration in taste and color. 
Feel...a carbonation that dictates the bitterness in the back end very nice. much lacing
Overall...This is a nice beer but get a lot of the same notes from Celebration fresh hop and there are many sierra beverages i like a little more... they are a victim of all of their previous successes. 
Its good why not try it!!!"

LOOK is dark-amber with 1.5 fingers of tan head. Retention is average leaving a collar.
SMELL is slightly below medium in strength. The smell has stone fruit, malt, candied sugar, coriander, allspice and a bit of yeast. It smells fairly sweet.
TASTE is medium-hige in strength. The taste has the flavors in the smell, but it is far less sweet, and more balanced and dialed back than the aroma.
FEEL is moderately thick. It is moderately creamy, carbonation is just beluw medium, and astringency is low.
OVERALL, it is a Quad with an outstanding flavor."
4662,Saluki,The Sixth Glass Quadrupel Ale,4.01,"Held a slight head. Not the best looking beer, nice color but slightly cloudy. Has the basic flavors of a Belgian, just not as rich as the real thing. Can definitely taste the abv. Has a good after taste in the mouth, maybe that's the abv. Definitely improved after it warmed up a bit."
4663,solok,The Sixth Glass Quadrupel Ale,3.89,"Mahogany color, minimal head. Molasses scent and taste. Some spice and malt flavor. Quite boozy. Nice feel. Decent effervescence. Not bad, but a little muted for a quad, aside from the alcohol taste."

O - This is a really beautiful looking Quad!"
4665,tobelerone,The Sixth Glass Quadrupel Ale,3.78,"This is a nice enough American take on a Belgian quad but fails to bring the depth and profundity of the great classics of the style. All the basics are there but you’re left wanting a little more richness of flavor, more lingering booziness in the finish, fullness and creaminess rounding out the carbonation. Solid but a little unremarkable and a quad should, if nothing else, be remarkable. Big Boulevard booster here but this isn’t the one in their portfolio I’d return to very often."

F: Crisp, brisk, and lively medium-bodied with a firm middle and a gently creamy med-length lightly drying finish. Becomes softer with warming and is also slightly warming in the chest.

Aroma is a sweet malt with a dried fruit (fig, raisin) presence. Pleasant. 

Taste follows nose and the malt more fully expresses itself. Dark fruit returns and is complimented by yeast notes and a bit of light spice. The finish reveals a modest hop taste then dries up. 

Good strong carbonation and the mouthfeel is moderate. Drinks lighter than its ABV. No hint of the alcohol."

Pours into glass black and starlys that way with a fizzy Mocha head that goes away as quickly as it build. Not much barrel on the nose but it comes in nicely on the palate along with some delicious coffee and cocoa flavors. Chocolate and crystal type malts dance in there with no noticeable hops.
Worth seeking out."

Bourbon Barrel Peruvian Morning– Brewers Reserve poured an almost black/very dark brown with a thin tan head. The head dissipated rather quickly to a small and narrow collar of foam. The smell is dominated by coffee and bourbon from the oak barrels. The taste is of coffee and chocolate up front with hints of caramel and bourbon at the finish. Mouth feel is high-medium to full with moderate carbonation. There is a little warming from the bourbon at the finish.

Peruvian Morning is a complex flavorful American Imperial Stout that is very drinkable for its high ABV."
4675,bowzer4birdie,Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Peruvian Morning,4.19,Very chilled bottle poured into my GI snifter. As it warms over 45 minutes the coffee and barrel presence become more pronounced with the barrel having the upper hand. I expected a bit more from this one; still a very good beer.
4676,rex_4539,Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Peruvian Morning,4.52,"L: Very dark brown color, almost no head, not much lacing to speak of, light carbonation.

S: Chocolate, coffee.

T: Chocolate, coffee, sweet, alcohol. Very nice.

F: Full; bodied, full flavored.

O: A superb imperial stout, more on the dessert side."
4677,dcotom,Thumbprint Enigma,4.4,"Poured from 12-ounce bottle into a champagne flute. Deep, almost cola-colored body, with ruby highlights and a thick light-tan head that hung around seemingly forever before leaving scads of spotty lacing. Notes of Door County cherries, with a little vanilla and oaky tannin plus a generous helping of wild-ale ""funk."" The tart cherry really begins to pop through when the beer warms toward room temperature. The sourness is quite restrained, possibly due to its time in the oak tanks. Overall, beautiful, festive, easy drinking, and delicious."
4678,MonDak_Joe1953,Thumbprint Enigma,4.18,"12oz bottle. No dating information found, but the label name is 'Enigma 23'.
Brown colored body. Light tan head sticks around as an island and expanded ring. Leaves behind small lacing webs.
Aroma of cherries, oak, and woody yeast.
Taste is a sweet tart combination. Flavors of cherry, oak, vanilla, caramel, chocolate, and a little smoke. Woody yeast arrives late and lingers into the aftertaste.
Smooth and silky mouth feel. Dry finish. Good carbonation.
A layered beer with cherry upfront and yeast at the end, and all supported by the oak barrel. Vinous to a degree."
4679,Luscious_Malfoy,Thumbprint Enigma,4.03,"poured from a 12oz bottle into a tall new glarus pilsner glass. pours like coca cola out of the bottle but gathers in the glass a murky, dark brown with three fingers of sandy brown foam. the nose and taste is a somewhat muddled mix of oak, delicate and yeasty funk, faint black cherry and event hints of red grapes. however i get a slightly flanders-esque vinegar aroma and flavor that i just don’t care for as it’s very distracting. medium-full mouthfeel. pretty slick and smooth. as it warms though, i just get more of the vinegar. a little bit of an unusual flop from this place."
4680,DarkLordScott,Thumbprint Enigma,4.23,"Pours dark amber with a nice, dark head. Aroma is dark cherries and wild yeast (strange as that may sound). Taste is sour, but pleasantly so, with again dark cherries and a moderate to light body. Nicely different."
4681,Bouleboubier,Thumbprint Enigma,4.41,"(12 oz bottle, no date/code, 'Enigma 23'; purchased single last week from their Beer Depot... poured into my Chouffe tulip)

Dark, reddish-brown liquid, limited-to-no-clarity; tall rouge-tan foam stand, tight and creamy; a few lacy bands... very floral-forward aromas with cherry-vanilla ice cream at the base, and a nutty yeast accent; bits of chocolate chunk and wood speckled in... woody, almost nutty brown ale flavor sits in a thin layer between a cherry-flecked flowery top note and the tart cherry-soaked, but relatively dry, clearly oak-hewned, malt-rich base brown-ed ale, colored with soft touches of milk chocolate and cocoa snaps... I must reiterate this is not a sweet beer, though it's got all the desserty flavors just begging for decadent dulce... not so much bitter as it is more tart, stamping a stingy stripe across the middle of the tongue... brief bit of bouncy roundness to its body before it drops mad dry at the palate floor, airy aft, but leaving a woody-tannic warmth pasting the palate roof... this tastes and drinks beautifully, though looks a little suspect and has that superb cherry accent to it that doesn't feel quite right, but ultimately arguably for sure (mostly) tastes like a Flemish brown; this is a work of art, wish I knew and bought more (2198)"
4682,Mdog,Thumbprint Enigma,3.99,"Appearance: Dark Brown with a thin head.

Smell: Some wood first, then funky acidic, maybe a hint of cherry.

Taste: Tart beer, with some brown sugar and sour cherry in the background and finish.

Overall: Picked up a single at the brewery. I'm not usually a tart/sour beer guy but I'm willing to try and tick a style. It's an interesting beer but not one I'll revisit."
4683,minterro,Wee Heavy,4.35,"2022. Bought for ~13$ at Alesmith's brewery in San Diego, CA for a beer tasting with my buddy Ron. Just a few quick notes because during these tastings I don't spend too much time writing.

A&S: Not much head on this one. Brown black colored beer. The aroma is sweet with hints of oranges.

T&M: Very easy to drink. The taste is peet, black licorice, and butterfingers. Medium mouthfeel and carbonation.

Overall: I would recommend it."
4684,kitch,Wee Heavy,3.97,"A 1 pint 9.4 fl. oz. foiled and capped bottle, with no clear bottled on or best before date. Poured into a snifter glass.

Appearance: A cloudy amber copper orange colour with very thin beige head that dissipated quickly, while leaving some lacing.

Aroma: Dark fruit, prunes, caramel, toffee, booze, with a light roast and a hint of chocolate.

Taste: Sweet malt, light roast, caramel, toffee, dark fruit, prunes, brown sugar, with light notes of chocolate.

Mouthfeel: Medium to full bodied with light to moderate carbonation.

Overall: A nice sipper with good flavours."
4685,Sigmund,Wee Heavy,3.68,"750 ml bottle, kindly shared by abemorsten. ABV is 10%. Very dark ruby colour, nearly black. Low beige head. Aroma of malts, dark dried fruits / prunes and caramel, maybe a hint of smoke. Very rich and malty flavour, again with caramel and prunes, and maybe a hint of smoke. Powerful stuff."
4686,drdiesel9483,Wee Heavy,4.19,"Look - dark brown muddy color with a slight film rim
Smell - sweet caramel booze with some fig
Taste - a lot like the scent
Feel - a lot of body light carbonarion
Overall - great tasty beer. A lot like a barley wine"
4687,rodbeermunch,Wee Heavy,3.67,"Had this when I was visiting the old brewery. Pours a dark mahogany and chestnut brown almost leaning into black territory. We're talking ~ looks similar to an imperial porter at this point. Tan colored head, 3/5"". Good retention. Solid looking beer. The aroma is a mixture of earthy malt, toffee bitterness, booziness and mild smoked caramel sweetness. 

Taste is chewy but not thick. More of that brown and smoked malt (in a minor way, not rauchbier levels) aspect. Mingles some dark fruit like influence. Mouth feel then gives more nuanced complexity in that you start getting more of a nuttiness angle to compliment all the other stuff. Moderate heat, which means at a double digit abv, it hides the alcohol decently. Thinner body than the appearance and taste would seem to indicate normally. Carbonation on point. This seems like a good candidate for an evening around a fire, especially campfires."
4688,Darkmagus82,Ipswich Oatmeal Stout,4.09,"Poured from a can into a pint glass
Appearance – The beer pours a deep brown color with a small head of light brown head. The head has a decent level of retention, fading slowly over time and leaving a light level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – The aroma of the brew is strong of a roasted malt and oaty smell mixed with some coffee and a bit of brown sugar. Along with these smells comes notes of fudge and crème. Other light notes of brown bread and caramel are there as well, giving a dark and roasty smell overall.
Taste – The taste begins with a very roasty and toasty flavor mixed with lots of coffee and some nice oat flavors. Other flavors of toast and roast as well as some caramel and cocoa are there as well. There is a bit of a brownie like flavor as well as some notes of nuttiness. Toward the end the sweetness and roastiness increase a bit, leaving one with a rather dark and roasty taste to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is thick and chewy with a moderate carbonation. For the big rich flavors the feel is good and makes for a nice slow sipper.
Overall – A decent oatmeal stout nice for a cooler fall day. Rich in flavor and very representative of the style."
4689,jeffdr123,Ipswich Oatmeal Stout,4.15,"From a can from Beer of the Month. Pours a thick, dark brown with a sizeable head. You can smell the roasted malt, and the taste is even more dominant. Also a good bit of roasted chocolate. A very flavorful beer. I drank it side by side with a Samuel Smith Oatmeal Stout, which is smoother with a vanilla sweetness. But Ipswich held its own - and was its own version of stout."
4690,KenjiN,Ipswich Oatmeal Stout,5,"I gave a mixed review to a previous sample of this beer; it turns out that was an improperly-stored sample. This is my updated rave review for Ipswich Oatmeal Stout:

This brew is black and viscous, with an expansive, lingering tan head.

The aroma is rich and earthy. Something about the nose also makes me want to describe it as creamy. 

The texture of the brew is creamy, too. The carbonation level is perfect. 

The beer abounds in delicious semisweet chocolate flavors. The finish is long, with malt and hop flavors melding beautifully. 

This is a glorious beer, with some of the richness of an imperial stout but more drinkability. This is very possibly my favorite stout!"
4691,WoodBrew,Ipswich Oatmeal Stout,4,"I am trying this beer off the tapper at the brewery as part of the ""Classic"" four sample flight. It poured a dark opaque with nice tan cascading head that left a spotty lace. The scent had subtle malt and roast notes. The taste was nicely balanced and easy to drink. There was a subtle sweet roast and chocolate malt base with hints of coffee presence. The mouthfeel was smooth in body with good carbonation. Overall it was a great beer."
4692,brewme,Ipswich Oatmeal Stout,4.25,"Reminded of this beer by the How many Beers of Fame have you reviewed? post. I did not realize that I had not review this brew before. I have had this many times before, looking forward to trying again."
4693,milkshakebeersucks,Ipswich Oatmeal Stout,4.18,"Pitch black appearance with a large, mocha colored head and lots of lacing; a real treat for the eyes. Charred malt aroma, with notes of coffee, smoke and bittersweet chocolate. Roasted malts rule the taste, but sufficient hops help maintain a good balance. Smooth, full bodied mouthfeel that is nicely carbonated. Dry, bitter, lingering finish. Very enjoyable."
4694,tradershmulie,Ipswich Oatmeal Stout,4.02,"Very fine beer. 

Pours a very nice deep deep brown, almost black. Rich brown head. 

No noticeable smell. 

Very smooth taste - full bodied and slightly sweet."
4695,WildernessMonk,Porter,4.5,"Nice blend of coffee, chocolate and smokiness. Perfect brunch beer, nice and smooth."
4696,Pivopijak,Porter,3.94,"draught
Quite dark chestnut, with a little dark orange, for highlights. Moderate, but fairly sharp, dark roasted grain aroma. Pretty good level of dark roasted grain, in a medium light bodied brew, and it goes on to the finish."
4697,snaotheus,Porter,3.9,"2021-11-09
16oz can served in a tulip. Dated 09/28/21. Received from @WunderLlama as a retaliation been in NBS BIF #14.

Pours dark with a big, medium-density head, light carbonation. Smell is moderate chocolate and coffee and a lot of nuts. Yeasty, grainy, maybe some anise.

Taste is similar, though somewhat mild. Chocolate coffee and nuts, anise somewhat muted, mild to heavy roasty bitterness, some light woodiness, and some grainy sweetness.

Mouthfeel is medium to thick. Overall, a very solid porter."
4698,KP7,Porter,4.33,"I'm a big fan of this porter. A ton of roast bitterness, really on the border of too much but it keeps it just on this side of the line. A nice feel and body as well."
4699,Mcb99d,Porter,4.83,"Ok, so the beer I had was a coffee porter on nitro at the brewery but I could not find it on beer advocate. This beer is so ridiculously fantastic. Smooth, creamy, not overly carbonated, subtle notes of vanilla and chocolate. Idk, it’s just great."
4700,Jaystar,Porter,4.24,"Wicked! Much more lively than a typical porter. Enough hops to cut into the syrupy malts, which still dominate - as they should. Satisfyingly rich and dense with enough fizz to balance and cut that. Drinking one satisfies nicely - but not so heavy that more would be too rich - as can be the case for me with porters. Wicked!"
4701,VoxRationis,Porter,4.3,"Decanted into a 12 oz (355 ml) clear goblet from a 16 oz (473 ml) can; canned on 07/07/20.
A: Pours a very dark, clear brown color with a two finger, tan head, cap and ring retention and complex rings of lacing.
S: Aromas of molasses, cocoa, mocha, toffee, and macadamia nuts
T: Semisweet. Flavors mirror the nose, but much more birch beer and/or sarsaparilla. Solid but balanced bitterness.
M: Light to medium bodied with moderate effervescence
O: Mayflower has come up with a light but delicious Anglo-American Porter."
4702,jzeilinger,Raspberry,4.23,"On tap at the source.

A - Big, deep, raspberry colored pour with big, pink, dense creamy lacing.

S - Big pasty, sticky, twangy raspberry jam on the nose.

T - Follows the nose with a big, twangy raspberry jam with some puckering character and a lingering twangy raspberry jasmynness on the back side.

M - Medium body and slight puckering.

O - This is nicy done."
4703,Tree_powers,Raspberry,4.32,"Nose is a huge pile of fresh raspberries. Pallet is fresh raspberries with squeezed Lemmon. It is a fair bit sour and tart but also with a touch of sweet too.
Feel is sour and light to medium bodied.
It's delicious"
4704,brewandbbq,Raspberry,3.75,"Bottle from 2008.

Pours clear copper with a ruby hue. Zero head or retention. Funky in the nose with raspberries. A bit cheesy. Light bodied with a slickish mouthfeel. Raspberries on the palate with a mild acidity. Finishes tart."
4705,rodbeermunch,Raspberry,3.62,"So much of what the black rim nerd glass contingent in craft beer thinks is just not true. The story behind this beer will get around to explaining. Anyhoo, 10 years in the cellar, you decide to break it out during a softball game, because you're the whitest barely hispanic on your overwhelmingly brown latino team who absolutely love raspberries and the Donald. Yeah, that one. Actually 2010 bottle, so even older. 

Anyhoo, all geeked for it, it pours a ruddy brown with light red/pink notes to it. Claims of bullshit fill the air. I think we were up like 20-0 after 2 innings so this popped off celebration style. Didn't amass much of a head, but it was still carbonated. The aroma had a moderate amount of raspberry to it, but also pervasive sourness. 

The taste was enjoyable, its easy to hurr durr acidity warheads teeth enamel jokes, but this wasn't terrible. Yes, it was overly sour, but thankfully Michael crushed half the bottle. It seemed maltier than most lambics. I guess they're calling it a wild ale now. Makes sense. One dimensional, raspberry + sour power. But whatever."
4706,johnnnniee,Raspberry,3.77,"Bottle from brewandbbq, thanks for the opportunity! 
Lightly hazy golden with a red tint to it light smattering of bubbles light carbonation. Lemony tart acid with sweet and tart berry. Pretty nice."
4707,robotic_being,Raspberry,4.18,2018 vintage. Aged 3 years drank in 2021. Amazingly tart and juicy raspberry Lambic - sour. Well made and balanced.
4708,NCSapiens,Raspberry,4.02,"Really good sour raspberry flavor with a delicious malt aftertaste. Slightly too tart, but otherwise excellent."
4709,macrosmatic,Raspberry,3.93,"Reviewed from (long-standing) notes. 2012 vintage 750 mL bottle, stored appropriately, and opened on 1/21/18. Poured into an El Catador Barrel-Aged glass.

A: Hazy to murky copper-ish red, with quite a bit of visible carbonation. Forms a thin white head that doesn't stick around.

S: Big lactic sour, with a much milder acetic tang underneath. Big underripe raspberries and cherries and malic acid punch. Lactobacillus funk, cheese, and feet. Light cracker malts, and I think a touch of woody dryness. Maybe a touch of Brettanomyces funk and dryness, but it’s buried under all the lactic and fruity sourness. This isn’t quite nose-hair-searing, but it’s smells sour for sure.

T: Again, a big lactic sourness up front. Raspberry fruity accompanied by some serious malic acid. Lactobacillus funk again, maybe some Pediococcus on the palate. Cheese and barnyard and horsey. Some light cracker malts, then a sizeable punch of lemony citric acid near the swallow with more seriously tart raspberries.

M: Average body for most American sours. Carbonation sensation a bit towards the low end. Low alcohol flavors.

O: This was a pretty darn tasty fruited sour, even after extended years. The age seems to have rounded out some of the acidity, at least compared to some of the other Upland sours I’ve had. It’s not the most tasty or complex or nuanced raspberry sour you’ll ever have. But it’s enjoyable."
4710,KenjiN,Torpedo Extra IPA,3.18,"I sampled this even though I've generally moved away from IPAs in recent years. The beer looks good, albeit dark (coppery in color) for an IPA. It's got a lasting off-white head. The nose is redolent of piney hops -- and sweet malt; the scent pervades the vicinity. The body is heavier in body than I'd expect from a beer of this (7.2% ABV) strength; it's thick. Bitter hops strike the palate first, and are quickly followed by caramel-tasting malt. 

The malt base is extremely sweet -- too sweet for my taste -- and the bitterness is high. The two components don't meld.

I liked this beer when it first appeared -- it was a time when the beer-world needed an assertive, true IPA at a reasonable price. My palate has changed. Today, Torpedo reminds me why I rarely drink IPAs."
4711,Danmooney40,Torpedo Extra IPA,4.15,"The classic bitterness I look for in an IPA. One of my favorites.

Poured from a can into a 10 oz pub glass, medium amber color, slightly hazy, a 2 finger lingering caramel head"
4712,ResearchRado,Torpedo Extra IPA,3.81,"Appearance: 
Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Amber honey. No head. Some lacing. Clear but rich in color. 

Aroma: 
Apricot. 

Taste: 
Sort of faint berry, piney hops, a little bit of malt, a little dry, bitter aftertaste. 

Mouthfeel: 
Clean. Well carbonated. 

Overall: 
Really nicely balanced West Coast IPA. Slightly darker and slightly maltier than some in the style (as a compliment). Refined and Classic.
Hops are strong - made my nose run and sneeze."
4713,LeinenkugelDrinker,Torpedo Extra IPA,3.99,"Good strong taste, robust smell, a perfect beer to sip slowly and enjoy. One of my go to IPA’s. Really great name too. Another classic by Sierra Nevada."
4714,Sheppard,Torpedo Extra IPA,4.28,"Pours a bright orangey golden color. Lots of grapefruit on the nose. It's perfumey with grapefruit, grapefruit pith, earthy pine, black pepper. It's a really solid WCIPA."
4715,CraigMammalton,Torpedo Extra IPA,4.56,"Exactly what I want from a strong IPA. Strong, piney, bitter, and a nice dark opaque golden amber color. If you want an IPA that is pine bitterness forward with only a hint of bite, malt, and sweetness this is for you. Easy drinking, one of my favorites."
4716,paylstep,Black Chocolate Stout,4.23,"a style between a russian imperial stout and chocolate stout. Incredible balanced chocolate flavour. extremely drinkable for the most part. Very very chocolatey, it's silky but not a nitro stout. Hard to drink the whole thing as alc comes through heavily and ruins flavour in later stages. A favourite of mine!"
4717,kotocar,Black Chocolate Stout,4.75,"This might be my highest rated beer here but it’s not my favorite. It’s very well done though for the style. It pours dark, almost jet black, motor oil. Amazing how they can hide the 10% abv here. Well done. It tastes much less alcoholy. Taste is molasses, dark fruit, electronics, burnt dark chocolate, and graham cracker.

I like this beer for a cold winter night by a fireplace. It has less “flavors” and going on with it than Narhal, but tastes better. It’s not as sophisticated, but the fact that they can hide the abv so well, makes this so enjoyable."
4718,LunchMoney,Black Chocolate Stout,4.31,"A chocolate malt in a beer! Pours jet black. At first, I didn’t get a strong smell, but then got a strong sense of the chocolate flavor. It’s delicious. Very dark chocolate flavor goes well with the bitterness of a Russian imperial stout."
4719,UncleReemus78,Black Chocolate Stout,5,"This stout is probably the best stout out of many that I've tried. It has all the qualities that a stout should have and one thing about this beers chocolate flavor is it came from the special grains and not because they used real chocolate. Adjuncts ruin the natural flavor profiles of the grain, malt, and hops IMO. It's not easy to hide an ABV of 10% either and if I would have been blindfolded when I took the first drink I would have guessed a 6% ABV. I highly recommend this brew to anyone."
4720,beercam,Black Chocolate Stout,4.68,"Pretty remarkable brew. Exceptionally unique. A contender with Old Rasputin and Narwhal, but succeeds in different ways. 

I think its flavor and feel surpass category rivals. It has a deep piney woodsy smokey chocolate element that others fail to reach. Faint teriyaki in a welcomed way. Gentle intimation of candied cherry, vague, distant blueberry? Maple syrup oatmeal comes in softly. Leather, tobacco, but barely. Anyone complaining of harshness should probably stay away from beers this strong. 

Its availability and branding leave a bit to be desired. More information on the bottle itself may help. Super muted smells but aromatics upon the sip and finish redeem. 

Absolutely exquisite mastery overall for the style imo. The sooty, chocolately, oaky complexity provides satisfaction for days. The feel is silky, rich, dynamic. The fact it’s 10% is stupendous, a very nimble brew considering. A barrel-aged variant could be next level. Thank you BB for your decades of artistic quality."
4721,xxxcjbcxxx,Black Chocolate Stout,4.44,"Delish. Can't stop comparing to DuClaw's glitter unicorn w/e beer, so there's that, as far as visuals go. Also, can't notice much that it's 10% because it's so flavorful. Love how there's no actual chocolate in it but still reminiscent of it. Not dark chocolate--BLACK chocolate. :) 
(Did a quick search, it's Unicorn Farts, no wonder I didn't remember the name. It raised the standard visually for me, so as to why this component doesn't get a perfect score.)"
4722,Braunmeister_1943,Black Chocolate Stout,4.39,"A truly amazing RIS! Look, Smell, Taste and Feel are all outstanding! This comes as close to a perfect RIS! This and Bell’s Expedition Stout are the pinnacle of the style!"
4723,eak3,Black Chocolate Stout,4.71,"This is a super smooth imperial stout that does not taste like a 10%er. Chocolate upfront and a little bit of tang on the backend. Great pairing for chili, beef or any hearty fall/winter dish."
4724,GlenFarclas,Black Chocolate Stout,4.58,"Scored from memory - if one considers value there's no comparison (except, as noted below, maybe Narwhal). Will return when I crack into a 2023, also have a 2021 so I'll consider both."
4725,benandemmiboo,Black Chocolate Stout,4.69,"When you combine the taste, the impact, and the cost, only Sierra Nevada's Narwhal comes close. Though chocolate is in the name, there is no actual chocolate, with the taste coming from the malts. I love that it's not a dessert beer, that it's strong but easy to drink, and that I can get it for less than $2 per bottle when I buy a whole case. I continue to try new high ABV stouts from local MD breweries, etc, and some are marvelous, but they're never truly superior to Brooklyn's Black Chocolate -- and they're almost always at more than twice the price. And so, to drive home this point, how can someone enjoy a 10% ABV stout for less than $2 per bottle, and not want to get it again? A beer I must never forget when $20 bottles of Bourbon County stout come to town."
4726,Franziskaner,Black Chocolate Stout,4.04,"Black in color with a fingernail of brown around the rim and covering three quarters of the top. The aroma is of dark chocolate. I’m tasting bitter dark chocolate, dark malt, and some piney hops. The mouth is thick and sticky."
4727,KGT426,Black Chocolate Stout,4.75,Excellent Stout!
4728,Cathartes,Black Chocolate Stout,3.85,"Allowed to acclimate to room temperature for 18 minutes and poured into a snifter.

Pours an incredibly dark brown with equally dark brown hints around the edges, and a 1.5 finger dark tan head.

Initial aroma is a hint of black licorice, followed by Dutch processed cocoa powder, I think there's some raisin in there. I might get a tiny hint of smoke and oak, but I might be hallucinating.

Initial taste is bold and powerful, perhaps a small hint of licorice but otherwise just a big and slightly overwhelming experience to take a large sip. It's quickly followed by bitter Dutch cocoa taste across the middle, back, and sides of the tongue in the middle and aftertaste. I get some bitterness not from the chocolate but from the beer itself as well. Tasting it again after, I realize that in the initial taste it's the alcohol I'm tasting, followed by the licorice, then the cocoa and bitterness. As I get through it I taste a little raspberry, but only in the aftertaste, and only when sipping very small amounts, it's a much welcomed note with the chocolate. Additionally, as I get towards the end the alcohol becomes more noticable in both aroma and taste. At the end I thought the alcohol tasted similar to that of vodka burn and made me think of hass avocado skin and the color olive drab. I know that doesn't make sense, sorry.

The mouthfeel is nice, not exactly velvet smooth but it is definitely smooth. It glides over the tongue easily. Oily and slick, in a good way, if that makes sense.

This is something I could imagine myself sipping slowly with my legs crossed, wearing a nice jacket and having a discussion with someone in a nice living room.

May buy again but not terribly likely, overall a good beer that I enjoyed but did not adore and I think I'm satisfied with drinking once."
4729,tbumnnc,Three Philosophers,4.56,"Great melange of flavors - cherry, chocolate, plum and blueberry, SMOOTH and balanced."
4730,Saluki,Three Philosophers,4.09,"Drinking next to a Sixth. Similar color but clearer. Similar minimal head. Nice fruit flavor, the cherry, well balanced with the malts and abv. Quite delicious. No issue drinking the other three in the four pack."
4731,D-Dog81,Three Philosophers,4.8,"This beer is wonderful. I left it out of the fridge for a little bit so it would be at the 50 degrees serving temperature that they would recommend. I'm just slowly sipping on this one and don't want it to end! To me, the aroma is fantastic. Cherry, dark fruit, a hint of alcoholic sharpness, but not overpowering at all. Creamy slightly tanned colored head, nice lacing on the glass... Very much enjoyed in small sips. To me, worth the $18 I paid for a 4 pack of it. I'll hold onto the other 3 and enjoy them appropriately."
4732,DimlyLitQuonsetHut,Three Philosophers,3.63,"Not off putting but very heavy and sticky. Quite sweet. Lots of warm spices but nothing standing out. Muddled. Some acidity and sourness. Really not my thing, but for the right person this would be great."
4733,Howard_e2001,Three Philosophers,4.43,"Damn! That's good. On draft at Flying Saucer, Ft Worth. A lot of complexity. Nothing overpowering. Great balance. 
Great color. Light aroma. Light carbonation. I wonder what how it would present with a little more carbonation."
4734,BJB13,Three Philosophers,3.96,"12 ounce bottle poured into a snulip.
Best by: 8/30/28

L: Ruby brown, mostly clear, 2 finger ruddy tan head, foam is rocky and spongy and persistent.
S: Slightly mineral, light fruit aroma, both dark fruit and berries, chocolate malt, some alcohol.
T: Opens rich with a hint of chocolate and dark fruit malt sweetness, but is ultimately sharp, tart and bitter, well attenuated, finish is reminiscent of bitter baker’s chocolate.
F: Medium-ish body smooth and frothy, has a little heat
O: Decent sipper."
4735,NeilSilber1,Three Philosophers,4.53,Pours dark tan with light Belgium style carbonization. Malty sweat finish make this an amazing domestic Belgium style strong ale.
4736,whynot44,Three Philosophers,4.27,"Dark reddish mahogany color with a respectable tan head that hangs around and produces lots of nice lacing. 
The aroma is raisins, figs, brown sugar, caramel, earthy with some hints of cacao. 
The taste is all of that and more, lots of brown sugar and dark fruit, a bit of allspice, cherries and toffee, a hint of alcohol, just moderately sweet but luscious. 
The body is full, moderate soft carbonation, smooth and very drinkable. 
This is really a great take on a Belgian quadrupel, very tasty, complex and enjoyable, especially as an after dinner sipper or as a cold weather warmer, outstanding."
4737,MrOH,Hennepin,4.68,"This is another one of those beers that have been around and drinking here and there so long that I'm surprised I haven't reviewed it.
Pours a cloudy gold with a huge white head. Can't fit the 12oz bottle in a pint glass. Excellent retention, bands of lace
Aromas of green banana, ginger, white pepper, savory herbs, a bit of citrusy coriander.
Sweet bready malt flavor with an awesome herb and spice component; I get celery, flat-leaf parsley, coriander, ginger, white pepper, and a bit of clove along with some green banana and pear.
Light bodied, effervescent, fluffy and satisfying mouthfeel
Really set the standard for American brewed, clean saisons."
4738,harrypowers,Hennepin,4.35,"Pours a clear golden color with a runaway tall foamy head and heavy lacing.

Smells of yeast, banana, citrus and spice.

Tastes of sweet malt, Belgian yeast, orange, pear and apple with an alcohol warm peppery finish.

Medium light body with moderate carbonation. Slightly syrupy, smooth mouthfeel.

This is a very tasty, well-made brew."
4739,Neelbeer,Hennepin,4.25,"Look: huge head that receded quickly
Smell: Yeast, lemon, orange, little bit of banana, marshmallow maybe; touch of pear 
Taste: follows nose with the fruit flavors, especially lemon peel; celery taste (maybe what others are calling coriander), considerable bitterness, a hint of sweetness, I did get the ginger but it took me a while; a little funky; wintery spices, quite a luscious beer
Finishes dry but with a sweet tingle; pleasant carbonation, low viscosity but still creamy with the foam, and crisp
On the whole, I like the spices and flavors of this beer. A good, modern saison. I got this one from Whole Foods."
4740,AzfromOz,Hennepin,4.12,"Procured in a trade/proxy arrangement with @turkeysdrinkbeer in February 2022. Drink in October that year.

L: There are orange cordial vibes going on with the presentation of this beer, making my mouth water before I even contemplate putting my nose into the glass. There's no head bar a small rim around the edges. Sediment from the full-bottle pour hangs suspended in the beer, barely ruffled by the few large bubbles of carbonation that dart to the top of the glass. 

S: On the nose, there's a slight yeast note and an indefinable tanginess that hangs in the aroma. 

T: The taste has sweet orange, sherbety orange pith and yeast - that orange note probably accounting for the tanginess I picked up on the nose. The orange is followed by a musty, slightly aniseed note. It's probably the coriander and whatever bird-of-paradise grain is. Or perhaps it's the last vestiges of the yeast playing with those spices. Regardless, it's extremely tasty and definitely compels a second mouthful straight after the first. 

m: On the tongue, there's almost a sherbety quality to the beer, but it's followed by a spritzy snap after the swallow, and it dries things out quickly after that point. 4.25

O: This beer comes together extremely well. The taste is somewhat unique and the mouthfeel and nose only add to that impression. I wonder if I could drink more than one of these, though, as I can imagine palate fatigue setting in quickly with such a sweet, sherbety beer. It treads this side of the cloyingly sweet line well, but volume could push it over. Based on drinking one rather than several, however, it stands up very well. 

Cheers!"

4742,Fedorable,Hennepin,4.02,"Awesome saison that most people could pick up and enjoy. Love the color on this and the foam sticks around forever. Bright, orangey taste with a bit of ginger, some delightful malty sweetness. Smell is a bit off-putting: very sour and yeasty, a bit funky. But it's a very pleasing drink, would definitely get it again. Ommegang is consistently excellent"
4743,KT3418,Hennepin,4.13,"This was actually pretty close to excellent for me, great floral notes, grassy underpinnings and a good citrus finish. I liked this one more than I thought I would"
4744,Jonoesh5,Hennepin,4,"Expected a little more from this brew for the price and the rating. enjoyed the carbonation (akin to with a semisweet sparkling wine mouthfeel), but overall it tasted too much like booze and spices. I got mine from a 4-pack at a grocery, so maybe a draft experience would be different. Might seek out again."
4745,Cathartes,Rouge (Red),4.22,"11.2 oz bottle acclimated to 51°F and poured into a Chimay chalice.

Pours a murky brown, dark but pale in saturation. Produces a 1.5 finger, foamy, persistent khaki head, leaving moderate lacing.

Initial aroma is prunes, rum extract, and molasses. Further smells yield notes of dark brown bread and a hint of caramel.

Initial taste before swallowing is rich in dark malt and dark fruit.

After swallowing I'm first hit by powerful dark brown bready malt, then a note of sticky caramel, which is joined by some mild to moderate hops, which mellow, yielding a slightly metallic but pleasant and sweet caramel malty finish in the back of the mouth with a kiss of hops in the front. Notes of raisin found throughout.

Feel is really wonderful, the best way I can describe it is that it really is really like drinking liquid grain."
4746,Weisenbeer,Rouge (Red),4.32,Tastes like a delightful combination of a brown ale and sparkling champagne.... I should have known that once I popped the cork this Belgian beauty would be quite delicious ... I was not disappointed
4747,AdmiralOzone,Rouge (Red),4.33,"Pours murky brown with a tan head that leaves spotty lacing. Aroma is caramel malt, dark bread, yeast and stone fruit.

4748,MadMadMike,Rouge (Red),4.02,".33 L bottle. Best by 7/2027. Poured with gusto into a snifter, a fab beige cap forms atop hazy mahogany fluid.
Aroma is caramel malt, yeasty dough, figgy plum.
Flavor is right in the same pocket. There’s nutty goodness, date, an assertive hop pops joy. Well balanced. A bit chewy. The yeast note corrals everything together and keeps any overt sweetness at bay.
Mouthfeel is medium-full, and it has bouncy carbonation.
Overall, a fine, really easy drinking offering from the Cistercian Trappist Monks of Chimay."
4749,KleinSchwein,Rouge (Red),3.79,"Poured from a 330ml bottle .

Pours deep brown , thickly milky with a mocha head that leaves moderate lacing .
The smell is subtle , very yeasty and earthy and the taste follows on from this , the subtly surprising me as I expected it to become robust , it's still richly yeasty with hints of burnt caramel, wood , minerals and plum with a pleasant bitterness , the flavour sweetening as it warms .
The mouthfeel is voluptuous.
Overall it's heavy in a good way , rich but subtle in flavour. I prefer westmalle dubbel which matches this in style closely but I'd not say no to this at all . If I have this again I think I'll let it warm a while after pouring to begin tasting it , I like the sweetness and fruitiness that come as it warms ."

IBU: 69
Velvety, tan head. Thick and bold, black looking elixir. Soft, dark and caramelized, roasted grains, for the aroma. Slightly watered down, dark roasted grain and dark chocolate flavor that is OK."
4751,TheMatts,Chocolate Stout,4.69,"This beer is really good. Beautiful opaque look with a smaller dark khaki head. First sip and you already taste the chocolate. This isn’t your normal dark chocolate stout, this is a milk chocolate flavor and it is good. Probably higher on the calories so probably only have one, but if you get the chance to try it, do it."

4754,Alieniloquium,Chocolate Stout,3.53,On tap at Das Beer Garden. Black body with a nice creamy khaki head. Smells of cocoa and roasted malt. Tastes of cocoa and roar malt as well. Milk chocolate without the milk. Roasted malt and light bitterness in its stead. Medium body and very drinkable. Low carbonation. Hitting some of the old classics and this does not disappoint.
4755,Tsar_Riga,Don De Dieu,4.43,"A - Pours a mostly clear golden orange body, a short white head that fades to a thin ring, minimal small bubble lacing. Pretty.

S - Strong notes of spice and banana, esters that promise deliciousness. Malty bread with a bit of minerality, and some grape and apricot fruit notes.

T - Follows the nose, with spice bread and banana sweetness, fading toward bread with honey and floral accents in the middle, and just a hint of acidity and minerality in the finish.

M - Subtle carbonation, moderate weight that comes across a bit slick, easy drinking, no sign of the alcohol, with a close that is not the least taxing.

O - This is an example of what a good Tripel can be - dangerously drinkable, soft and lush, and always delicious. I love this one."
4756,ZebulonXZogg,Don De Dieu,3.61,"Pours a foggy golden color, white head lingers leaves some spotty lacing. Nise gets some citrus and candy. An Xmas gift from John & Lorene."
4757,JZH1000,Don De Dieu,3.72,"12oz bottle best by May 31st 2025

On the pour 1 finger of bright white head, with not the best retention forms on top of a deeply golden hazy body. There is some sediment floating around. 

Aroma comes off as a cross between a Witbier and a triple, with candied orange and wheat meeting you right up front followed by a fresh orange brightness. From there the malts and Belgian yeast really take over leaving you with a spicy slightly sweet dough like finish.

Flavor departs slightly from the witbier idea, with a more pronounced herbal bitterness that leads into a phenolic and citrus, but also a touch caramelly body of Belgian goodness. There is a touch of a funk, but the flavor is actually quite malty and sweet. A solid cross of bright citrus and sweet doughy dessert.

Feel is quite full and again a bit dessert. Despite that there is a dryness throughout even into the long finish. This beer comes off as more of a lazy sipper than anything else.

Overall, I enjoyed this beer, as it was unique and tasty, but it just wasn't mind-blowing I suppose. Good if you like witbiers and strong but slightly sweet Belgian pale ales."

4760,Wattie83,Don De Dieu,3.9,"Poured from 12oz bottle to a weizen glass. Look is clear solid gold color with a dense white head that lasted a long time. Clouds up quite a bit when you pour in the residue at the bottom of the bottle. Smell is wheat bread, apple, some spice. Taste is malt, wheat cracker, light clove, coriander, apple juice. Feel is medium bodied, solid carbonation. Overall, this is a good beer where the flavor outshines the aroma."

4765,RoyalT,Double Crooked Tree IPA,4.39,"Appearance – This, dirty pond brown had an appropriately moderate head.

Smell – The nose is powerful and equal parts toasted malt and heavy citrus hops with light lemon. This is a big balanced DIPA.

Taste – The monster hops step up at the taste but the heavy malts keep them in check. A sharp pine flavor shows up at the taste.

Mouthfeel – This full-bodied DIPA is moderately dry. I expected a super-dry finish but the caramel from the malts keeps it pretty even. There is absolutely no alcohol sting so beware of this 12.0 ABV heavy hitter.

Drinkability – This is dangerously easy to chug."
4766,Msp004,Double Crooked Tree IPA,4,"12 oz bottle from 2015 (don't know bottle date) .
Poured dark amber, minor head dissipated quickly with some lacing.

Nose of a convoluted battle between hop, malt, pine, caramel and ?!? teriyaki ?!?

Palate of hops and hops interlocked in a battle with malts, caramels and pine. Semi thick mouth feel with slight sting left on the tongue. Higher AVB not really noticeable on the mouth but definitely warms the central nervous system after several quaffs.

This one aged rather well becoming smoother. Just the teriyaki aroma on the nose I can't place my finger on and seemed a little off.

Enjoyable."
4767,mcgiants,60 Minute IPA,4.18,"Full pint can purchased as a single poured into an IPA glass.

4768,ResearchRado,60 Minute IPA,4.4,"Nice. Classic American IPA.

Poured from a can. Off-white pillowy head. Beautiful light golden color. Clear. 

Malty. Bitter hop undertones that don’t overpower but are obviously present. Faint sweetness from the malt that I prefer. 

Clean. Smooth. Rich. Hoppy."
4769,FreePal88,60 Minute IPA,4,"Well, obviously it's like 90 Minute IPA but with a lower power level (both in alcohol and taste). Mellow, earthy, vaguely herbal, vaguely piney, maybe a tiny bit of citrus (but what citrus there is immediately transmogrifies into those earthy notes). Malt-leaning for an IPA. A pretty dark, complex taste IMO."
4770,BGDrock,60 Minute IPA,4.28,"A muted gold/amber body, verging on clear; forms a thick, fluffy head like a cloud, sandy white like beach foam. Solid retention of several minutes.
A mélange of hop aromas - tropical fruit (mango), orange, pine, even some peach.
Right from the start there's a sense of pleasing balance across the board - sweet grain malt with deft resin hop bitterness, perky carbonation with a soft feel, quenching while also being worth slowing down to enjoy; medium carbonation, fine, with a medium body (might be some wheat in there to give it that lovely feel); over time, it is a touch sweet and some stickiness shows in the feel, and could use a touch more hop character.

This is a benchmark IPA, no doubt. I could drink this all day at a pub, it doesn't go out of it's way to be different, it just does what it is meant to do really well. Beautifully crafted."
4771,highdesertdrinker,60 Minute IPA,3.96,"Pours a nice medium gold with good head and lacing. The smell ain’t much out of a glass of draught and would maybe be better in a bottle or can. Some malt and grain with a hint of hop. Smells more like an aal. The taste is smooth, good malt, some grain, a little hop, pretty smooth and refreshing but nothing mind blowing but it’s tasty on tap and does the job. I’ve had better from these guys with Aprihop and Burton Baton to name two but a solid entry on the Buffalo Wild Wings menu, cheers!"
4772,brettsdailybeer,60 Minute IPA,2.74,"Seems like I'm a bit behind the curve on trying Dogfish Head's 60 Minute IPA, perhaps due to my location out west, where it doesn't garner as much buzz. Given the rapid evolution of IPAs, this one disappointingly misses the mark. Its aroma lacks the citrusy and hoppy notes that I appreciate in modern IPAs, and the flavor profile is similarly underwhelming. Despite its reputation as one of the trailblazers in the IPA world, it's evident that the style has far surpassed it over the past two decades. Man, that makes me feel ancient."

Cloudy, pale gold colored body. One finger of white head which retreats quickly to a few islands and a ring. Leaves behind thicker webs of lacing.
Aroma of pine resin and orange/grapefruit/pineapple hops.
Taste is juicy and bright. Flavors of orange marmalade, some grapefruit, and pineapple. Good amount of pine resin but the bitterness is balanced with the juicy sweetness.

4777,PathofChaos,Enjoy By IPA,4.53,"Appearance:
Translucent, pastel gold. Proffers up two fingers of finely minced froth that’s white as an untouched snowcap. Modest retention gives way to sudsy, webbed lacing.

Bouquet:
A mango, pineapple, peach smoothie rife with tangy Citra and bright, tangerine-sweet Amarillo, woven together with slender strands of earthy Mosaic.

Feel:
Full-bodied and thick with hop oils, the texture is given a much needed third dimension by a boisterous, peach fuzz carbonation.

Taste:
A huge chomp of just-ripe, yellow mango topped with shreds of candied orange peel. Then, lemony Citra and the tropic sweetness of Amarillo rise like flowers from the distinct, new earth flavor of Mosaic hops. Concludes on a long, low, afterburn of hop bitters and sauvignon blanc."

4779,UncleReemus78,Arrogant Bastard Ale,2.8,I think this would have been a great beer if they wouldn't have over hopped it. They missed the mark on the strong ale profile and landed on an overly bitter IPA. I can't rate this one very high. I'm gonna give it 2.5 out of 5 stars because the Brewers are confused on what a strong ale is and what it tastes like. My idea of a strong ale is St. Bernardus with an ABV of 10.2. When you compare the two and you will taste the difference. They should have named this beer Ignorant Bastard Ale.
4780,MichaelGrande,Arrogant Bastard Ale,4.3,"Surprisingly bracing/harsh initially, but in a good way. Slowly revealed layers of flavor - pine, caramel, citrus peel. Not feeling the alcohol burn that so many others described. Stood up straight, can take a punch, had some swagger. A substantial beer with a personality. We will meet again."
4781,mcgiants,Arrogant Bastard Ale,4.04,"16 oz can poured into an IPA Goblet type glass.

Really struggled at the store on what to get and settled on this. Got some Christmas stuff but wanted something else for today. I have had this before but it has been a while and I do not remember it being this dark. Really nice mix between a bronze ale and a black stout (color wise). Taste is definitely strong. Bitter... upfront as well as the aftertaste. Rye is prominent. Has a nice subtle smell which is boozier than the taste. Good beer. I am more IPA and/or Winter Warmer and/or Creamy Stout/Porter. This is different from all of that. Truly unique."
4782,QuietlyJudgingYou,Arrogant Bastard Ale,4.5,"Appearance: Pours a dark ruby color with a nice ring of some crackly tan foam. Sticky lacing.
Smell: Pine, bread, caramel, brown sugar. As it warms it has a really nice smell of honey.
Taste: Very bitter up front with some hefty notes of pine sap. Simple syrup, a little bit of caramel and a really nice rye bread/burnt toast flavor make up the body. I'm tasting something like almonds or pecan in here, not very strong but it reminds me of mixed nuts. A hint of something roasted towards the finish with a bitter and dry aftertaste. As the beer comes to room temp the flavors pop out a bit more.
Feel: Medium bodied, well carbonated, no alcohol warmth. 
Overall: Unique. It's very bitter, complex and full of flavor. Pretty damn good."
4783,FreePal88,Arrogant Bastard Ale,3.97,"Boozy, caramelish, a little chocolatey, and very bitter. Stout-like roasty warmth, IPA-like focus on hops. Good palate cleanser, but it draws attention to itself and somewhat overwhelms the flavor of anything you eat alongside it."
4784,brettsdailybeer,Arrogant Bastard Ale,4.23,"Arrogant Bastard Ale by Stone Brewing is more than just a beer; it's a standard-bearer in the craft beer scene and the flagship offering from the brewery. Its dark, almost mahogany hue is a visual treat, preparing you for the layered experience ahead. The aroma alone is a rich medley of malt sweetness intermingled with subtle hops, signaling that you're in for a balanced and complex sip. Take that sip, and your taste buds are met with a harmonious interplay of initial malt sweetness followed by a purposeful bitterness that adds depth without overpowering. In essence, it serves as a litmus test by which I measure the quality of all other ales.

In a beer landscape filled with mediocrity, Arrogant Bastard Ale breaks the mold by refusing to adhere to any one category. Its audacious character extends beyond its name, manifesting in a flavor profile that's robust, balanced, and deeply satisfying. It's a cornerstone in my ever-evolving understanding of what a truly great ale can be, elevating the standard to an all-new level. To say that it merely raises the bar would be an understatement; it is the bar."
4785,sjrider,Arrogant Bastard Ale,4.09,"Can pour - clear dark amber/mahogany with thick foamy beige head leaving significant lacing. Nose is roasty malt with hints of citrus and resin.

Nice for what it is."
4787,Khocolate,Arrogant Bastard Ale,2.56,"I mistakenly pick this Ale up from a Pick- Six and realized that it wasn’t a IPA which I am use to drinking. Needless to say, not impressed at all, the ale is overpowering with alcohol."
4788,BloodSoakedAleMug,Arrogant Bastard Ale,4.55,"Look: Pours a deep shade of amber with a generous, three finger head of beige foam that has excellent retention and laces the glass very well. No visible carbonation.

Aroma: Sticky toffee and caramel, bitter grapefruit peel, spruce needles and toasted orange peel. A touch of sweet/funky guava.

Taste: Upfront, treacle and sweet tamarind. Quickly transitions into moderately bitter notes of flambéed orange and grapefruit peel. Ends on rich notes of bitter tree resin and spicy spruce needles.

Feel: Full bodied and velvety. Very low carbonation. Silky smooth and creamy. Alcoholic heat profile is very mild, but somewhat detectable, I wouldn't call it boozy but you can definitely tell it's not a light weight beer.

Overall: I've had this beer many, many times but haven't had it in a while. It's much better than I remember. Would highly recommend to anyone who likes their west coast IPAs and hasn't tried it yet, or any veterans who may have not had it in a long time. Definitely a world class imperial IPA / ""strong ale""."
4789,Saaz83,Arrogant Bastard Ale,3.72,"Poured in standard pint glass. Nice ample, fine sustained head. Very bitter, slightly boozy when straight from the fridge. Did not enjoy, had to walk away. Allowed to warm slightly but still cool, had a more pleasurable experience. Prominent bitterness was accompanied by greater complexity of flavors including leather, wet tobacco, faint hint of dried fig. Well-suited for a cool Spring day post-yard work. 

A beer I would prefer not to eat a meal with, but rather enjoy on its own when in the mood for something strong and different. Never got to enjoy the barrel version. With its name; likely a victim of its own success, but as with a once fantastic bottle-conditioned bicycle beer, it happens. At least this beer still retains its general character and is not simply concerned with appeasing the easy-drinking masses. Still memorable for a first-timer. Not a go-to by any means, but will not hesitate to drink again on occasion."

4793,TheBrewsClues,Lagunitas Sucks,4.18,"The name sounds like its referring to the brewery, with a bit of self-deprecation, but it's really about 2020. But this beer is the opposite of 2020. It's a dry-hopped DIPA with an abundance of complex flavors stemming from the multitude of grains used in its brewing. Lagunitas really hit the right combination. For a dry-hopped brew, it is a nice crisp bitterness. Checks all the boxes of a solid DIPA with big flavor."
4794,RJLarse,Lagunitas Sucks,3.39,"Pours a gold color with a creamy white head. A little chill haze. It has a medicine taste, maybe because of the ABV? It's very hop forward but not my pint of beer. I like the regular IPA better. It does taste a little like the year 2020, so there's that."

4796,MetalHead7734,Samuel Adams Boston Lager,3.58,"This review is for the ""Remastered"" Boston Lager. Poured from a bottle into a pilsner glass.

Look: Thick off-white head and light caramel colored. Actually good head retention.

Smell: Malty with a moderate hop accent in the background. A light caramel note.

Taste: Starts with a strong caramel, malty note. The hops are nothing more than a light accent here. The finish starts malty but eventually some hop flavor creeps in which provides a pleasant zing at the tail end.

Feel: Just light enough to not be completely boring. Carbonation feels about right.

Overall: A perfectly fine brew, but a little boring. Fairly well balanced, if maybe a little under-hopped.The overall caramel character is nice. They've really dialed the hops down a couple points with this one. I can see this pairing well with some pizza or something. I cant say that I can really see there being a huge market for this in the current beer climate. This beer seems like more of a background player."
4797,Mvr6507,Samuel Adams Boston Lager,3.12,I've been a huge fan of Boston Lager for over 20 years. The last time I had it was before the Remaster and I have no idea why they needed to change it. It does not hit like it used to in terms of overall flavor. The bouquet of hops that used to hit the nose are no longer there. The former bite it had is now gone. It used to be the hallertau hop aroma was present but it's just not there. Such a strange transition from beer that was great.
4798,LanceBiggums,Samuel Adams Boston Lager,4,"Clear copper amber with a white head. Toffee, biscuit, and a hint of pepper on the nose. More hoppy on the flavour, with citrus and pepper notes, and a bit of caramel malt sweetness. Drinks a lot like an English ale, though the amber lager influence is apparent too. Overall surprisingly good for a beer brewed on this scale."
4799,dano213,Samuel Adams Boston Lager,3.56,"12oz bottle received as a gift. APR 2024 on the neck of the bottle; not sure what that means in terms of when this was bottled but I would guess that it's dated six months ahead. If so, that would mean that this was bottled in October, and this would be approximately two months old. It also says P 319 3 1952 22W which may mean that it was bottled on the 319th day of 2023; if so, that corresponds to November 15, which would make this beer 31 days old.

Look: It's a light amber color with light copper tones. The beer has lively carbonation and an off-white head that is sticking around for a while.

Smell: On the nose, I get notes of cola, bread crust, and caramel. There are some subtle dried fruit notes along with some grassy/herbal hop character. There is something that smells a little weird about the aroma, but I can't place it.

Taste: My initial reaction is that this beer is very drinkable. But after a few sips, I am getting the impression that it has too much sweetness and something is not right in terms of the beer's balance. Up front, the beer has notes of caramel and toffee and some chocolate as well. There is mild bitterness on the finish but I am still left with a cloying maltiness on my palate and the beer seems out of balance to me.

Feel: It's on the lighter side of medium bodied. It has a bit of creaminess and chewiness. The carbonation seems to be right.

Overall: I am curious to learn how this beer has been ""remastered."" For me, the beer lacks balance. This beer lacks the crisp, clean, snappiness that a Vienna Lager should have, which also allows it to be the sessionable beer that it should be."
4800,blkgeorge,Samuel Adams Boston Lager,3.88,Remastered version is cleaner and brighter tasting with the same flavor profile but without the prior heavy syrupy sweetness. It's better.
4801,MetalRugMan,Samuel Adams Boston Lager,4.4,"Great beer, the taste is perfect. this is a beer that I don't like sharing."
4802,LeinenkugelDrinker,Samuel Adams Boston Lager,3.25,"Everything about this beer is just a little better than average. It certainly is unique, but not overly great. Very drinkable. Smell is citrusy with hop notes, while taste is hoppy with citrus notes. Solid 3 and a quarter."
4803,Cholla,Samuel Adams Boston Lager,5,This is Boston Lager Remastered. I think I like the older version better. It’s not a bad beer. It’s easy to drink and very quaffable. So give it a try. You might like it. Cheers!
4804,Sluggo1987,Samuel Adams Boston Lager,2.83,"This is the new Remastered version

At first glance, it's obviously much lighter in color. It also has much less on the nose. The taste is aggresively hop-forward, almost as much as a Pale Ale, and has almost no maltiness to it. This gives way to bitterness from the hops and finishes slightly sour. This is not the Boston Lager I've enjoyed for almost 20 years. If I wanted hops and a lack of malt character, I would have bought a pale ale. Nothing gold can stay."
4805,dbl_delta,Samuel Adams Boston Lager,3.88,"Bottle into pint glass. Pours a deep honey color with a persistent off-white head. Decent lacing. Initial impression is roasted malts, light caramel, a bit of hops, and a slight spiciness. Mouthfeel is medium and quite smooth. Finish fades to slightly sweet maltiness. Overall, a very nicely done lager."
4806,waudozer,IPA,3.97,"It's just typical IPA but it hits all the basic notes, bitter, rich, toffee, tropical fruit hop notes, hint of saltiness

Pretty nice"
4807,jbolger,IPA,3.6,"Gets better as it warms, but overall very average. Noteworthy is the ratio of Gots to Wants. 3500 Got it but 250 Want it."
4808,Roxchambeau,IPA,3.75,"Pours exceptionally clear for the style with a solid 1 - 1.5 finger head. Little to no lacing. A few strands of carbonation in the glass. Looks slightly darker, but as clear as a pils or mainstream adjunct lager. Orange and some pine on the nose. light to medium body. Malt character more present than most IPAs. Easy drinking, especially cold (er). Perfect for the friend being introduced into craft brews or on a day when you don't want to think too much about what you're sipping on."
4809,colts9016,IPA,4.27,"1967
Name: IPA
Brewery: Lagunitas
Location: Petaluma
Style: IPA
ABV: 6.2%
Date: 11/06/23
I am drinking Lagunitas IPA today using a Tulip glass. I served it at 46 degrees. The pour created an airy, foamy, two-fingered, white head with average retention. The color is straw yellow, charting around SRM 6. The somewhat slow dissipation left some lacing on the glass. The beer's clarity is crystal, with a few carbonation bubbles. This style's overall appearance is above average. 
The initial aromas are grass, melon, grapefruit, herbal, and floral esters. The hops are aromatic and fragrant. Nosing the glass again, I smell bready hops, light-toasted malts, tropical fruit, and peaches. The IPA smells like a typical well-made beer of this style. 
The hops are bright and balanced. The flavors are peaches, tropical fruit, lemon rind, herbal, floral esters, melons, grapefruit, a hint of oranges, a touch of pine resin, and grass. The malts are firm, bready, lightly toasted, and soft cereal grains. 
The mouthfeel is astringent, finishing crisp and clean. The body is medium, as well as the carbonation. 
This is one of my go-to beers to drink when there is nothing other than BMCs in the case. The fresh beer displays the balance of the different hops used. The malt backbone is firm, giving the beer harmony. An excellent example of a well-made IPA."
4810,Greymane,IPA,4.01,This is my goto IPA in Southern France. I can at least get this one West Coast Style IPA in a half liter can at the local Monoprix or on draft at several local pubs.
4811,EXACTLY,IPA,5,I prefer the bottle. My favorite and go-to beer.
4812,Sparty1965,IPA,3.23,Very average.
4813,soma5,IPA,4.7,"This has been a go-to for many years. Once, it was on the hairy edge of too hoppy. Now it seems to be middle-of-the-road that way. Bottles are better than cans."
4814,natejpsixx,A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale,3.87,This is a good beer and something I would buy again but it's not a beer I would tell anyone they must try. It's real clean and straight forward. I like how it's not overpowered with citra hops or tons of fruit like a lot of IPA's.
4815,klarcbarr3,A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale,3.92,"L= A somewhat hazy yellow body, one finger white head which disappears quickly. some lacing remains throughout.
S= Lemony grapefruit piney hops. It's ok
T= Thanks, divine forces of the universe, for allowing a bit of sweetness to temper the lemon grapefruit pinecone sourness.
F= The watery/sticky balance is fine, but it makes my mouth pucker. 
O= I tried this brew several years ago in New Jersey, and found it to be amongst the best of IPAs' to that time in my beer tasting lifecycle. I still didn't really LIKE it, and I still hated IPAs. Since moving to Michigan, where you can rarely find a good stout, porter, or pumpkin beer (In the home state of FOUNDERS brewery, DOHHH!) , I have been forced to try some IPAs. I have surprisingly found a few good ones, and no longer hate IPAs. aLittle Sumpin' Sumpin' still reminds me why I hate(d) IPAs, and I would do well to avoid this beer in the future. My rating is overly complimentary at 3.92 because I intrinsically view the glass as half full, not half empty."
4816,BillAfromSoCal,A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale,3.73,"Other than the smooth feel, initially impressive head, and hints of wheat in the taste I find little to recommend this. The head is a solid 2 fingers, white, but comparatively short lived with little lacing. Not much smell at all. Not much distinctive flavor or bitterness, other than the wheat influence."
4817,Saluki,A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale,4.3,"From a can into a frozen stemless wine glass.

The first time was a let down, was expecting a little more. But after about 4 six packs over a year, the straight forwardness is appreciated, and this one gets chosen over the others on a regular basis. Enough good taste to cover the abv, and not trying to be edgy, fancy, fruity, fizzy or trendy. Went back again and liked it even better,"
4818,Mugman8,A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale,4.21,"Gold hue, not much of a head, some lace. Aroma is dank resin and hops. Taste is bold -- 50% wheat malt, 50% Washington State variety hops. Floral, not fruity with a slight bite, followed by a dry finish. A good one!"
4819,HorseheadsHophead,A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale,4.15,"Mostly clear, slightly hazy copper. White head. Good retention and lacing.

Mango, orange, grapefruit, pine.

Candied mango, papaya, grapefruit, orange zest, brown sugar, and pine."
4820,karlstratos,A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale,4.85,"Possibly my very favorite beer of all. I love everything about it, the refreshing taste, the smooth feel, the golden look. Cheers!"
4821,ramseye4,Centennial IPA,3.98,"A- phenomenal. Gorgeous amber hue, big fluffy head and great lacing.

S- orange hits up front. Pine, lemon zest, flowers, subtle bread 

T-more subdued than the aroma would indicate. Bready syrupy malt hits first, with some piney hops coming in second. It’s pretty good but not up to par with the aroma and appearance.

M-full bodied with decently bitter aftertaste 

O- it’s good. And for 17 dollars for 15 of them it’s a steal"
4822,whitro17,Centennial IPA,4.36,"Look - deep amber, off white head, decent lacing
Smell - piney, citrusy, floral
Taste - pine resin, tangerine, caramel malt
Feel - medium body, well carbonated, effervescent
Overall - I got pine over here - 7.2% ABV 65 IBU's and I'm choking on the splinters. Classic Centennial hops deliver with pine resin, floral and citrusy notes. Well balanced beer with a caramel malt sweetness and good bitterness on the finish. Solid brew and a great value on the 15 pack. Suggested pairing with Loser by Beck. Get crazy with the cheeze whiz."
4823,Manta200,Centennial IPA,3.96,"6-er from my trusted liquor store for just $8.99
This combo of hoppy and malty is quire nice, like it!"
4824,Tricolour_Absurd,Centennial IPA,4.82,"This is a beer I always buy if it’s under three months old, the beer gods smiled when Centennial was born, I got these only 40 days old…

nbsoc;
Aroma, complexity, hops and malt. This is IPA. They squeezed complexity out of one hop most breweries can’t squeeze out of three or four, BIG flavor riffs. Aroma and head die a little, but very slowly comparatively to many other ales, this is not a major detractor however as when this beer warms up in the glass the flavors open up, delivering astringent plant matter where originally there was only bitter pine and citrus, both immensely enjoyable. 

This beer would make Micheal Jackson happy, buy it at this price and be happy too!"
4825,guitarguyny,Centennial IPA,4.17,"What a value! Picked these up at my local Wally World for $20 for a 15pk! Caramel on the nose followed by some piney, caramel and malty goodness! Finish is a bit hoppy but not too hoppy! Great bargain!"
4826,rclangk,Centennial IPA,3.75,"Pours a reddish copper with a generous off-white head. Fragrance of pine and citrus. Tastes of pine, citrus, and caramel malt. Mildly bitter with a hint of sweetness.

Another fine product from Founders."
4827,Trainman4beer,Centennial IPA,4.59,"Slight reddish tinge to otherwise fairly clear brew. Slight pine (?spruce) note, as the hoppiness comes roaring through. An IPA lover's delight for sure."
4828,LBThiele3382,Centennial IPA,4.75,"Well, I'll be honest, this is my go-to IPA! Hoppy goodness with an outstanding malt-balance. Great amber color. Hoppy, yet sweet aroma. Bitter, yet sweet flavor. It's in my fridge at all times! Bonus alert: I get a 15-pack at the local for $16.99! Cha-ching! There is nothing I don't like about this beer!"
4829,nasal,Centennial IPA,4.16,"This is my everyday beer. It's the best at its price point, although, to be fair, there aren't many 7% beers under $20 for a fifteen-rack. It has some lovely complex sunny bitterness, with some unfortunate blandness in the aftertaste that would work well for someone new to hops, compared with some other heavy IPAs. Smooth for 7.2%, but it lacks some of the fruity and citric complexity of its baby cousin, the Founders All Day IPA. This is not a special occasion beer. It's just a solid everyday sipper."
4830,Stonesole,Centennial IPA,4.53,"Very close to a personal fave IPA standard set by Bell’s Two Hearted. It’s not quite Northern Midwest, but way good, especially at $18.50 a 15-pack… (!)"
4831,mhhsvt,Centennial IPA,4.22,If you’re new to the IPA-craft beer scene or not… this one is very good. Not to mention that it comes in a 15 pack and costs a bit less than 12 packs of other fine IPAs. The beer is outstanding! This is a win win!
4832,cbuzz24,120 Minute IPA,4.13,"When I started this beer, I wasn't fond of it. The smell was quite good, like a good wine. Dark fruits, very raisin like taste and I hate raisins. As the beer warmed, the flavors of dark, bitter chocolate began to come out. I allowed it to sit for a few more minutes, and man, now it is nice! As I sip it (an hour and a half in now, and almost done), the booziness has gone from up front and in your face to nearly nonexistent for me. I will be saving the other three bottles and aging them, will try another in about 6 months on the beach! This is the 2022 bottling at 17% abv."
4833,NickSMpls,120 Minute IPA,4.23,"Bottled 8/23/19. Amber pour, viscous with light head. Nose is a. It boozy, but otherwise unremarkable. First sip has a strong alcohol burn at first, but softens up to an impeccable smoothness and dominate hop flavor, to the nth degree. Long, long finish. Taste runs to dates / figs, perhaps some maple notes, with a bit of sweetness. Very intense. Otherwise, feel is very dense, no carbonation, everything is going into the concentrated tastes. Remarkable drinkable if you can handle the alcohol. 

Going on 4+ years and the beer is starting to lose its balanced, but still reflects its origins."
4834,stortore,120 Minute IPA,4.32,"12 ounce bottle into a tulip snifter. Bottled 3/30/17, had 5/3/22.

Pours a somewhat cloudy medium amber, with a quarter inch foamy head and some spotty cling. Aromas of caramel, malt, brown sugar, some pine, some raisins, light figs and dates. Pretty similar flavors- caramel, pine, malt, brown sugar, light raisins and dates. Tastes a little bit herbal, with a light hop bitterness and some alcohol warming as it warms. Smooth for the ABV, a very good medium body, appropriately carbonated. 

Wow, this really does age well. Lots of caramel, malt and pine. Need to buy this more often. Really enjoyable."
4835,acycler01,120 Minute IPA,4.81,"This beer is so unique that it’s hard to describe. 
It really is nothing short of incredible and worth every penny of the price I paid for it. If you’re lucky enough to find a four pack of this in the store, don’t even hesitate just buy it."
4836,Bluerabbitbell,120 Minute IPA,4.13,"5/20/23 Poured from a 12 oz bottle purchased at the Denny House, Waynesburg, PA....Gala night for The Way.

Pours a strange (not bad) deep amber orange color. Very little head or lacing.

Hints of sweetness with the very chewy beer. Pine and pineapple. Smooth, hoppy bite!

Special beer and a fun night!"
4837,ryan1788a5,120 Minute IPA,4,"12oz bottle poured into a snifter. 2017 vintage, 5 years old. 

A: The most vigorous pour I could muster did not turn up any head. Deep brown in color with good clarity. I half expected sediment, but there really isn't any. Not much in the way of lacing either. A few tiny specs.

S: A lot of raw honey, apricot, malty aromas of fig jam and a pop of berry. Highly estery with pineapple/tropical notes. Orange marmalade complete with peels. Earthy and leafy notes with that aged ""forest floor"" character. Treacle and a hint of toast/crust. 

T: Follows the nose. Lots of raw honey up front, figs and berries, richer malty notes of molasses and toasted crust and scones. Very tropical and estery- big notes of pineapple, starfruit, papaya. Orange marmalade. Hit of warming alcohol. Downright spicy with herbal oiliness. Earthy and leafy. Dose of ""musty book"" and nutty sherry oxidation. Aggressive spicy/oily hop finish with trailing alcohol heat and figgy malt. 

M: very thick with a ton of coating residual sugar. It is syrupy in texture. Good pressing sense of weight. Carbonation is fading, but there's still some fine pricking around the tip of the tongue. Gritty hop astringency. 

O: This beer becomes very interesting with age. It might be an acquired taste for those who prefer IPAs fresh, though. It becomes a three way brawl between a brawny malt character, aggressively estery alcohol, and a good dose of oily/spicy hops. Age has deepened that malt into a lot of fruity complexity, brought out more earthy ""forest floor"" hop notes, and a lot of musty and sherry-like oxidation. It's also hot and a bit much when fresh though. Something like 1-3 years of age may be the sweet spot for me I think, but it comes down to preferences. It certainly isn't bad now."
4838,eatsluggs,120 Minute IPA,4.29,"Well, well, 15$ for this one. Had to try it. Nice experience after a hard day of work. But no sir, it ain't for me. 
Tastes like a bitter honey syrup. Low to no carbonation. 
Definitely worth to try. Once!!!"
4839,WIllBonds,120 Minute IPA,3.99,"Yea, this IPA is an icon. However, not the most drinkable IPA for the masses. Your wife nor girlfriend will like this beer! I have heard the term Robitussin voiced. However, you, as a beer drinker, must try it at least once. I’ve tried it several times.Heavy and alcoholic are the first terms that come to mind. Refreshing, no. Tasty, yes. Everyday, no."
4840,izraelc,120 Minute IPA,4,Pours a cloudy copper. Thin foam. Very chunky. Cider aroma. Huge malt and hop flavor simultaneously. Very heavy. Sweet alcohol cider finish. Not really you typical IPA and not something I would drink regularly. Definitely worth a try though.
4841,Drinking_Mantis,120 Minute IPA,2.9,"the 90min IPA tastes so much better than the 60min that I assumed the 120min would be amazing. perhaps I have an unrefined pallet, but it tastes like a poorly made overly alcoholic mixed drink I would have made in college circa 2006. worth a try but I won't be having this ever again."
4842,ReverendSoup,120 Minute IPA,4.1,"Got a couple of bottles of this as an x-mas gift. Bottle's a year or two old, this is the 2021 release. Poured into pint glass.
Pours a dark, rich copper tone. The short off-white head dissipates quickly, but leaves a nice ring and dense lacing. Smells a little like apple cider. I take a sip. Malt! Malt, and it's punching me in the face. Much maltier than it is hoppy- a logical progression from the 90 Minute IPA, which holds the two in balance. I wasn't sure I liked it until I kept drinking and decided I definitely do. Very sweet. Brings a caramel apple to mind, and then you get piney notes on the back end to remind you you're drinking an IPA. A little alcoholic, which works here. I wouldn't mind it being more bitter. Perfectly carbonated with a full body. 
It's a strange IPA. A prior reviewer said it reminded them of a barleywine, which does track. Another reviewer said it's not an IPA, and I'm not sure I'm equipped to argue with them. I'm not sure what it is, though, other than Very Good. While I do appreciate a beer that is what it says it is, I can also respect a beer that dares to push limits, especially when it's this good."
4843,atigerlife,120 Minute IPA,4.18,"First, this bottle is very old. Not sure how old, but could possibly be around a dozen years old. Still have another bottle. So, with that preface...

Pours a dark copper, like dark apple cider. Opaque. Small brown head that dissipated quickly leaving a collar.

Aroma of malt, dark fruit, mild alcohol, dark sugar, spice and somewhat herbal.

Taste is dark fruit, alcohol [but not overpowering], apples, prunes, caramel, bread, bitter orange, dates and pine.

Mouthfeel is medium bodied and cleansing. Nicely smooth in the mouth.

Overall, very interesting. Hides the alcohol well and rather complex flavor notes."
4844,pulse,120 Minute IPA,4.28,"As per plan, this is the Xmas celebration beer, the last holdout from the Extreme box, bottled on 9/13/19. A little over three years old, it pours a deep coppery color into the tulip with lots of head that fades off rapidly into a partial top cloud and ring. It has a sweet, syrupy, and malty smell. It does taste sweet, more sweet than bitter. The bitterness is slighty, lingering around a slight alcohol taste. I think it's like butterscotch and caramel up front. It's a little fruity, definitely along the barleywine track. Fairly thick, syrupy, easy to drink but warming. Moderately carbonated and somewhat dry. Very interesting.

I would love to do a vertical taste test. The last time I had this was in... 2019! At a tasting event that also served Utopias. It's powerful. I'm really out of the race at this point."
4845,FRANKHAZE,120 Minute IPA,1,"This is in no way an ""ipa"". It's false advertisement and a horrible beer product for $11-12 per bottle. It's all hype/gimmick. It's not satisfying at all. It's over the top in the worst way. Should be discontinued."
4846,jmvogel512,120 Minute IPA,4.73,The 2022 version is the best iteration of this beer that I've had. The hops and malt are in perfect balance for an imperial IPA.
4847,Franziskaner,Samuel Adams Octoberfest,3.65,Dark amber in color with a fingernail of khaki brown on top. There’s an aroma of caramelized bready malt. I’m tasting toffee and marzipan. The mouth is crisp and approachable.
4848,MetalHead7734,Samuel Adams Octoberfest,4.4,"Look: Moderate light tan head. Caramel or dark honey colored.

Smell: Caramel. Rich malt aroma.

Taste: Caramel sweetness that fades into rich maltyness. A small amount of citrus if you can find it. Finishes with more caramel.

Feel: Perfect.

Overall: One of my favorite beers. Perfectly balanced."
4849,47fvckegotism,Samuel Adams Octoberfest,3.34,Bready smell with light taste of floral and the smallest hint of bittersweet flavor
4850,DarkPassport,Samuel Adams Octoberfest,4.31,"Appearance: On tap into pint glass. Beautiful clear mahogany amber with almost no head and no lacing. The color was brilliant but the lack of foam was unfortunate. 

Aroma: Light malt notes. Toffee and caramel. Musk and oak.

Taste: Malt forward. Caramel that isn't too sweet. Toffee isn't as present on the tongue as it is on the nose. Lightly toasted bread.

Feel: Smooth. Carbonation is on the low side which seems to suit this beer just fine, surprisingly.

Overall: Fairly complex for the style without trying to be over-the-top. It's easy to see why this beer sets the American Oktoberfest bar."
4851,Brendan-T-Walsh,Samuel Adams Octoberfest,2.26,"Very poor experience. A 12-pack case over a month of reluctant drinking in late September.

The look and smell were promising, but the (very American) Marzen feels loaded with syrup. Sad!"
4852,Mainehawk,Samuel Adams Octoberfest,3.17,"Served from the can into a pint glass. Bright red amber color with a slight head which lingered. Light legs which cleared rapidly, Light carbonation. Full malty favor and lightly hopped. No after taste to my palate. Easy drinking. The bottle format seems to have a better head. Good Marzen but not spectacular."
4853,Rodya-CA,Samuel Adams Octoberfest,3.84,On Draft
4854,FreePal88,Samuel Adams Octoberfest,3,"Not hard to drink, but vaguely chemical-ish and artificial. Feels like a focus group of people who don't drink beer came up with an ""autumnal"" flavor for a beer. I dunno, every other marzen I've had so far has been better."
4855,LeinenkugelDrinker,Samuel Adams Octoberfest,4.35,Perhaps the greatest beer ever made. Definitely the best East Coast brew. Flavor is malty and smooth. Excellent feel. The smell is a bit underpowered though. Love these beers.
4856,Dylan184183,Samuel Adams Octoberfest,4.68,"Tasted great, a little pricey, but man it made me gassy later. Great color, and a great seasonal beer. Had a nice head when poured into a glass. Good beer for October."
4857,HaydenPlanetierrium,Samuel Adams Octoberfest,1.77,"Had two tonight to make sure the first bottle wasn’t as bad as I thought. It was, though, absolute ditchwater. 

Color is a mottled amber, somewhere between gold and red. It just looks brownish and uneven. Very little head, even with an aggressive pour, like it’s under carbonated .

What little smell I can glean seems unpleasant.

Tastes terrible. Vaguely beerish at best and certainly not like a Marzen.

Mouthfeel isn’t awful but isn’t great either.

Best to just skip this mess. What are they doing?"
4858,MrPhantasia,Dirty Bastard,4.5,Affordable despite the excellent taste and high ABV. An excellent full-bodied experience. Pleasantly bitter with an excellent easily drinkable mouthfeel.
4859,LesDewitt4beer,Dirty Bastard,4.43,"12 oz bottle filled 6/14/23 into a 12 oz goblet.
L: SRM 25 Pours an earthy dark ruby & brown with a thin smooth light tan head that has a slight orange hue, low steady fine carbonation bubbles, head recedes to thick edge foam, random sticky lacing.
S: Rich caramel malts, pecan, bourbon barrel notes, dates, raisins, a hint of brown bread, molasses, lightly sweet smelling.
T: Lightly nutty barrel notes, fairly sweet caramel malts, dried fruits, dark fruits, late-arriving citrus zest, light cocoa, peat, brown bread crust. Has a long lingering spicy & zesty finish.
F: Soft, easy-going medium to medium-heavy feel that is wet and dynamic. Has a long drying finish and becomes smoother overall with warming.
O: Very easy drinking Scotch Ale. Has sort of a mulled halo with sweeping barrel notes that are lovely and are not overpowering. Incredibly balanced tastes and a beautiful bouquet. Not overly complex. It is outstanding in its style."
4860,JozyMozy,Dirty Bastard,4.15,"Absolutely gorgeous pour, dark red with a couple of fingers of a light caramel head. 

Aroma is a little peat-y, slightly sweet, a hint of alcohol at the end. 

Taste is malty sweet to begin, but finishes with a pleasant bitterness. 

Mouthfeel is smooth, good carbonation. 

Overall this is a very smooth, interesting beer, but at a very sneaky 8.5 ABV, maybe one that I should enjoy with more moderation than most."
4861,nasal,Dirty Bastard,4.28,"Not as sweet as Robert the Bruce. This is much more hop-forward and less malty and sweet. It's so hoppy that it's dry. When it warms, a subtle funky peaty smoky flavor comes out. Nothing like Speculoos cookies and Boston brown bread. It's more like scotch. Really special and complex beer. I'd pick Robert the Bruce as a cheerful treat on a holiday, and Dirty Bastard for a contemplative and quiet winter night alone. It's one to savor."
4862,tyden46,Dirty Bastard,4,Strong dark fruit flavors with roasted bitterness.
4863,calvin_os,Dirty Bastard,3.73,"Interesting flavor, but I might be a wee lad. Wonder how this'd pair with a glass of Scotch whisky; I think it'd go well, probably."
4864,frogfarmer38,Dirty Bastard,2.93,"real thick hazy caramel color with some stained fizz, head all plump like a biscuit. it doesn't smell like much to me right now, but my nose is a tad stuffy. tastes like... the left side of a boot sole? you can really see what they mean by Dirty Bastard, it's heavy and strong and it hits you hard with those delayed hops but i dunno... founders historically hasnt done a lot for me and i cant say that the dirty bastard changed my mind. reminds me of a post christmas december evening, right when its really starting to snow and you get home from work after dark and youre a little glum from the holiday season being over, and then you notice that the wet snow has soaked into your parka. i would say that Wet Snow in Clothes is the best descriptor for this one (not entirely bad)"
4865,kotocar,Dirty Bastard,4.5,"I’m reviewing this for the style of dark thick string beer which this is. It’s resinous and sticky and thick and taste like caramel raisins. If I wanted to sip a darker thick boy of a beer slowly this is great. 

I usually like to throw back beers though so I probably won’t be drinking this one too often. But it’s a great beer I’d have at a restaurant if I only wanted to order one. This would pair well with a juicy steak."
4866,cwm51662,Dirty Bastard,3.79,"Early rating was a bit rough. A much better beer non-refrigerated. I do get some of the peat-y taste, more of the alcohol at the bottom. Refriged, it had like zero smell or body. I'm enjoying it much better, getting more of the taste, at room temp."
4867,mpruden,Dirty Bastard,4.04,"On tap at the brewery.

Appearance: Medium dark brown, very small light tan head that lingered, leaving some lacing.

Nose: A little peat, a bit of cooked sugar sweetness.

Mouthfeel: Smooth, medium heavy, adequate carbonation.

Attack: Toasted malt, light sweetness.

Finish: Balancing bitterness.

Overall: A very good Scotch Ale. Doesn’t have quite the bang of the barrel-aged Backwoods, but solid."
4868,ramseye4,Dirty Bastard,4.1,"A- Awesome. Rich mahogany, brownish head, espresso

S-toasted malt reminiscent of a brown ale, dark fruit, dates, iron 

T- toffee, rich malt character, candied fruit, leather 

M good

O- rich, nuanced, light a quad and a barley wine had a bastard baby. Very good"

4870,BillAfromSoCal,Dead Guy Ale,4.12,"Deep amber with chill haze. 2 finger tan head that recedes to a thin film. I wish there was more lacing. Malty goodness on the nose and taste, mostly on the taste. It gives way to some lingering bitterness. Medium body, low to moderate carbonation in the mouth."
4871,dano213,Dead Guy Ale,3.79,"12oz can purchased as a single off the shelf for $2.29 plus tax and deposit. Canned on 05/08/23, so this beer is just under 7 months old.

Look: It has a very nice copper color with a subtle translucence or a soft haze. There was a finger of beige-colored head that reduced to a thin layer. There is a steady stream of lively carbonation.

Smell: Nice caramel malt aroma with a helping of fruit notes including cherries, honey, apples, orange zest, and a bit of chocolate. There is a subtle, grassy, earthy hop presence underneath the malt. Some peppery notes also.

Taste: Very tasty. The bitterness level on this beer is a bit surprising and it lingers long. I mean, a high-bitterness beer is really not surprising if you know anything about Rogue Ales. But it is a bit unexpected from the nose. And that level of bitterness really helps to balance the maltiness of the beer. I'm not sure if this beer may be a bit oxidized? It's still tasty, I just wonder how much of the flavors have been affected due to age. Up front, the beer has a nice bready, nutty, toasty malt base. It doesn't take long though for the earthy, pithy, resinous hops to come to the fore and impart a strong bitterness on the palate that lingers long on the finish. I am also wondering if I was drinking this beer blind, would I be able to tell that it's a Maibock? I may have been fooled into calling this an English IPA or an ESB.

Feel: Nice carbonation. Medium bodied with a subtle chewiness.

Overall: It's been a long time since I've had this beer. Rogue Ale beers are some of the first craft beers that I have had. It was nice to be able to buy single 22oz bottles from Whole Foods Market or the local package store. It's also interesting to compare this beer with other more traditional Maibock beers. You can definitely tell the Pacific Northwest imprint that Rogue leaves on its interpretation of this style. Overall, it's tasty and you could actually make a session of this beer because it is well-balanced and would not get too sweet even though it is very malty. And it hides the 6.8% ABV quite well."
4872,JZH1000,Dead Guy Ale,3.9,"12oz, canned July 31st 2023

On the pour, 1 finger of barely off white head formed on top of a cloudy, dark brownish amber body. Head retention is just average.

Aroma is malty with some light, herbal, hoppy brightness. Malt imparts a honey sweetness, but doesn't come off as too dark. Surprisingly clean for a Maibock style ale. Mellow and aromatic.

Flavor is similar to the aroma, but has some of that ale character going on. It's still quite clean and malt driven, with some herbal and subtle noble hops also present in the flavor. Some toasty malt character is present. Again, surprisingly mellow. There is a slight bitterness that doesn't linger.

Feel is full and malty with a medium Ling finish, but it is still quite dry. This beer comes off as very versatile, but also a good cool weather outdoors beer for skiing or other mountain activities, just have a place for the night since this higher ABV is hidden well.

Overall this is a solid Maibock style ale that actually comes off like a maibock. Despite the darker appearance the flavor makes you think this is a paler beer than it is. Very malty in a good way."
4873,Dylan225,Dead Guy Ale,3.1,I like most beers don't understand the hype here...
4874,nasal,Dead Guy Ale,3.99,"Breadier / maltier than your average hoppy ale. Notes of molasses, like Boston brown bread. Hoppy and bitter. Extremely drinkable for a 6.8% abv, both in mouthfeel and in flavor. No smell. Autumnal. Quite well-balanced. My memory of this from drinking it ten years ago was that it was a ""meh"" in a sea of strong, complex West coast offerings. However, revisiting it, I can see the strength of something like this. I wouldn't choose it with Chimay on the menu, but it's light years better than other macro-scale micro beers. Quite good."
4875,BigMac59,Dead Guy Ale,3.79,"Pours a cloudy honey amber color with a decent head which dissipates quickly with almost no lacing. 
Aroma is malt and yeast. 
Taste is nice, definitely malt with some nice bitterness and spicy follow up. 
Feel is honey, with some carbonation and sharpness. 
Very nice. One of the few Maibocks I’ve had."
4876,jercasper,Dead Guy Ale,3.72,"Great maibock. Mild flavor but well balanced. I’d describe it as a malty, light IPA.

F - Medium body and carbonation.
O - Nice IPA, definitely a good choice when having a couple."
4879,P2daP,All Day IPA,4.75,"Honestly, I didn't wanna fanboy on it,so I kept it at an ""even"" 4.75 on all counts. For me, this is the best of all worlds in the IPA game. I've tried so many, but ultimately this is my go-to. It's not that I think it's the best IPA out there, but for me and my style of drinking, it's the only one that I can drink the way I like to drink. I know it's corny, but really can drink it all day, which I do. Often. My tastes run more towards a heavy hop-ness and light malt profile, so this just works for me. I'm all about the bitter, and for me and overly malty IPA takes away from the bitters. So, this is my beer of choice!"
4880,FreePal88,All Day IPA,4,"Limey, piney, slightly herbal, generically ""vegetable""-ish, light light light IPA. It's actually not that crisp or refreshing to me, for reasons I can't articulate, but I do like how it tastes and it's available everywhere."
4881,Deaconmark,All Day IPA,4.46,"This pours with a white head that is not dense but expansive. The nose in smell is of hops, fruity, and quite apparent in smell. You have to grade according to style and this hits all the boxes for a session IPA. Clearly all hops and fruit the body is light but yet the mouth knows it is beer of good taste. It lacks the malt of a true normal IPA and that is to be expected. In general for a beer of this ABV it could be my favorite. Drinking one under many different occasions will work. Keep a stock on hand."
4882,JZH1000,All Day IPA,3.91,"12oz, canned on August 4th 2023

In a hard pour, 3 fingers of bubbly white head sat on top of a not quite clear golden amber body.

Aroma is a slightly fruity take on a traditional WCIPA. A very full, piney and grapefruity hop aroma dominates.

Flavor follows the aroma with more bitterness and grapefruit pith is definitely the largest flavor. There is a slight malty sweetness that makes itself known in the back to make for a mellow finish.

The feel is lighter than most IPAs, but it is almost light, but with slightly more body. The hops stick around for a medium long finish, but there is a slight dryness and mostly neutral feel.

Overall this is an easy drinking low alcohol IPA, with full, traditional hop flavors, but an easy drinking, almost but not quite light mouthful. This is a great session IPA."
4883,colts9016,Pumking,4.5,"Review: 2006
Name: Pumking
Brewery: Southern Tier Brewing
Location: Lakewood, NY
Style: Pumpkin Ale
A.B.V. 8.6%
Date: Best By Date 12 July 2025
I am drinking Pumking today using a tulip glass. I served it at 46 degrees. The pour created an airy, foamy, creamy, two-fingered, off-white head with above-average retention. The color is amber with reddish hues, charting around S.R.M. 12. The beer is opaque. The dissipation left some lacing on the glass. The appearance is above average for this style. 
The aromas are pumpkin, bready, and floral. I thought I would get cloying sweetness with spices and pumpkins when I nosed the glass. I got a massive pumpkin, minus the heavy sweetness and spices. This has intrigued me! Nosing the glass again, I detect honey, floral, green herbs, and caramel. I am seriously not noticing any spices. That is interesting. 
I get a light spice profile of cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove taste. I was curious where it was; I am glad the brewers did not try to use spices to cover up the pumpkins. The gords are big and bright in flavor. The malts are caramel, toasted bread, and light biscuits. Other flavors are green herbs, soft floral, and honey. 
The mouthfeel is creamy with some astringency and finishes warm from the alcohol. The body is medium and has medium carbonation. 
This beer has been on the want list for a while, and I jumped at the opportunity to get it. This is an excellent example of what a pumpkin beer should be. Massive pumpkin flavors with light spices and honey accompaniments. The beer is balanced with a high A.B.V. I would love to get a bottle every year to see its changes. I am glad I ticked this one off my list."
4884,Lanoke12,Pumking,4.75,Look is dark amber. Smell is of fresh pumpkin and spice. Taste is of delicious pumpkin pie. Feel is thick and full bodied. This is the pinnacle of the pumpkin ale style and a beer I look forward to each fall.
4885,BubbleBobble,Pumking,3.69,"Pours a slightly hazy amber-orange, brief 1"" head before settling out to a thin cap, light touches of lacing. Nose is some initial alcohol burn, burned sugar, pumpkin pie filling, baking spice, old cinnamon, cinnamon raisin toast. Appreciate how the aroma does not veer into Frankenfood territory. Taste has big Melba toast vibes to be over anything pumpkin related; spice notes come in mid-palate, but they hit in an old and dusty, abandoned McCormick spice jar kind of way. Burnt sugar comes through more as it warms, along with more brown butter (perhaps this is the pumpkin?). Feel is pretty moderate for the ABV, clean and with some small but crisp carbonation. Drinkable, but doesn't scream ""Pumpkin"" to me."
4886,dkoehler42,Pumking,3.57,"Given that I reviewed it's sibling yesterday, I figured I ought to give the original it's due. It too pours a transparent amber, with a white-ish head. The nose is much subtler, with a faint whif of pumpkin spices. Some of the caramel notes are also present here, but the sweetness is toned down to a moderate level. The pumpkin flavor is briefly present at the end of the taste. Mouthfeel is pleasant, and enjoyable; I'm not wanting for more or feeling like I chewed on taffey."
4887,Spade,Pumking,4.17,12 oz bottle. Prominent pumpkin pie smell which is much more subtle in the taste. Some nice alcohol burn in the finish. A well-balanced beer and a great example of the style.
4888,Luscious_Malfoy,Pumking,4.18,"can’t believe i’ve never rated or reviewed this on here. have had it many different times both on draft and from the bottle as i used to get quite into the seasonals. this review is for a 12oz bottle poured into a revolution deep woods tumbler. pours a foggy burnt orange with a thin white foam cap. foam recedes into a collar around the rim of the glass. these style of beers are never super easy on the eyes but this one is lighter in orange color than some others and i think that helps. lots of pumpkin on the nose (obviously) but the thing that was always so appealing and also kind of astounding about this beer is that i don’t get a lot of the affiliated “pumpkin spices” you typically get in these beers. no cinnamon or allspice just pure pumpkin with a hint of malts and yeast. it’s quite nice. that said, it’s fairly one note on the taste but if you’re into pumpkin flavor or are in the seasonal / festive mood then this really hits the spot. it has a thick, full mouthfeel. i couldn’t drink more than one of these in a session but with the huge pumpkin flavor and high abv, it’s hard to knock this beer for that. it’s pretty damn good for what it is."
4889,Profundobaso,Pumking,4.19,"Look - 12 oz bottle poured into stemmed saison glass. light orange in color, just very slightly cloudy. Small head with trace lacing.

Smell - strong pumpkin scent and heavy on the fall spices, including a lot of nutmeg, cinnamon, and some vanilla. the smell is almost overpoweringly sweet and very to close of what I imagine a pumpkin pie in beer form would smell like.

Taste - very balanced. a mix of lightly roasted malts and pumpkin flavor hits the palate first, followed by a nice dose of spices, some sweetness, a touch of hoppy bite, and some warmness in the end. finish is relatively clean with residual pumpkin aroma.

Feel - medium bodied, average carbonation, and relatively high in booze at 8.6%. Alcohol is well masked, outside of the slight warmness in the finish.

Overall - this is a solid pumpkin beer and one of my favorites of the season. the smell might come off as a bit artificial to some (although I like it very much), but it really excels in taste and is an exemplary example of what a pumpkin beer should taste like."
4890,mpk2020,Pumking,4.15,Bottle
4891,Squeeb,Pumking,3.75,"This is the first time that I've ever tried a pumpkin beer and was pleasantly surprised! I truly didn't expect it to taste like pumpkin. I got this one while out at the grocery store with my girlfriend and was sold on the box art. The sweetness is really wonderful, and would say that it almost tastes like ginger ale. My only complaint is that I don't like quite how bitter it is on the front end, which leads to a fairly unpleasant lingering sensation. Otherwise, a really aromatic beer that is fantastic for this time of year!"
4892,Lambchops,Pumking,1,"They changed it so much that it isn't the same beer. 2023. This used to be my favorite pumpkin/Halloween beer, but they made it into a brand new beer its trash. It's a wheat beer now. Southern tier lost me as a customer. I literally poured the batch I bought out. I don't understand why you would ruin a good beer. Used to be my go to, bought hundreds for parties, but now I'm out. 200 to 300 bucks annually I spent on this beer to give you a picture and that is just me alone. I literally made an account because of how disappointing this is. You don't mess with a good beer and you don't piss off the fan base who buys the majority of your product. Might as well be budlight 2.0! Shame!"
4893,jonphisher,Bigfoot,4.58,"A beautiful looking beer; clear and a beautiful super ruby hued color, big fluffy off-white head that leaves some sticky lacing, above average retention, giving it a swirl revives a thick creamy cap that lingers and subsequently laces as it settles.

The nose is well; heavenly its pine and sap heavy but there are floral undertones that make it smell like a pine tree potpourri, malt presence is there, caramelized and melding with toasty qualities.

The taste is sticky and pine heavy, white pine needles in hop form, but so much better; they meld with the malt and give this a caramelized and sappy flavor all at once with just a hint of toastiness in the aftertaste.

Big beer; high medium, super smooth on the palette, its carbonation is so smooth and creamy as it coats the whole tongue with all the aforementioned pine and sap; which comes off as very resin heavy now in feel, big bitterness on the finish, a hint of alcohol but nothing off putting; it is there to remind you to beware of drinking to fast."
4894,FRANKHAZE,Bigfoot,4.07,"Beautiful copper red, aggressive hop presence, malty, smooth mouthfeel. Solid."

4896,LeinenkugelDrinker,Bigfoot,4.05,"Review for the 2024 Bigfoot only.

Look: Absolutely stunning deep cherry red. Medium-high head. 
Smell: I have to say, the smell is underwhelming. Light malt. 
Taste: Malty and boozy with a slight sweetness to it. Leaves a piney aftertaste. 
Feel: High in the mouth with a good amount of carbonation on the tongue. 
Overall: An excellent brew, very easy to enjoy. Yes, I would recommend."
4897,wiggibow,Bigfoot,4.59,"2023 release, bottle says packaged on December 1st, 2022 so it's just a hair over a year old.

Absolutely loving this one, I won't claim to be any sort of expert in judging a flavor profile, but I can say for certain that this beer is very complex in (for me) the absolute best of ways. The almost caramel-like malty sweetness fights the intensely bitter piney hops back and forth on the palette, continuously saving it from becoming either too sweet or too bitter; always landing somewhere in the middle but never lingering there too long. 

A lot to dissect here, which I could see being either a good or a bad thing depending who you ask. For me, it's a home run. This bottle was part of a mixed sixer, but I now feel obligated to go buy a full six pack and set a couple aside to see how things develop as it ages. Lovely beer!"
4898,guitarguyny,Bigfoot,3.53,"Like most of Sierra Nevada offerings, much too hoppy/bitter for my liking. May need to age some"
4899,robwired,Bigfoot,4.15,"""Barleywine-style."" Not a barleywine.
This 2023 brew came up with a two-finger beige head when poured into a snifter. Malty nose.
The flavor is intriguing. Roast pine, piney hops. Caramel.
The finish needs smoothed out with aging. A little bitter, which is OK, and malt on the back end. The label reads, ""... or cellar ... ,"" but I won't."
4900,Otter-the-Beer-Man,Bigfoot,3.97,"L: deep red color. Beige head forms at the pour. Thin half inch head dissipates slowly. Active carbonation maintains throughout the pint.
S: malt, caramel 
T: malt, warm smooth alcohol, caramel again
F: fizzy and warmth. Piney feel works up through the nose.
O: very nice beer. Will drink a couple and put a few away for later."
4901,Mindcrime1000,Bigfoot,3.91,"A 2023 iteration bottled on January 12, 2023 and poured into a tulip about five months later.

Pours dark/amber brown. Excellent head. Initially, it releases big bubbles from the bottom of the pour that slowly bubble up. Good retention and lacing. 

Aromas of dark fruit and piney hops, along with some modest citrus. 

The brew delivers initial sticky-bready caramel-malt sweetness balanced almost immediately by white pepper and pine hoppiness. As the brew warms, a distinct grapefruit citrus note rounds out the middle, along with raisin, peach, and molasses. Some anise, tobacco and leather are trying to manifest, but need some time to mature. Not as boozy as feared. There are quite a few different things going on here. 

Full bodied for sure, it nevertheless is very drying and tingly, which makes each sip welcome.

Overall, I understand why this brew can be polarizing, because there is nothing subtle or nuanced about a newer bottle of this brew. Regardless, this is a very flavorful American Barleywine that is excellent, but would probably be better with a little more age to smooth things out from what is currently pretty wild."
4902,talon757,Bigfoot,4.15,"This one appeared in our local grocery rural Montana grocery store and and I thought it worth a try. Up front, I'll admit that the word ""Barleywine"" grabbed my eye and I missed the word, ""Style"". While after buying the first sixpack for (at our store) a very reasonable price of $11.50 I then came back for the other four, I liked it very much for what it was, not what it purported to be. If you are looking for a Barleywine, this isn't it. If instead, you are looking for an very excellent dark imperial IPA this is the one! Hops to spare and definitely a worthwhile pint to keep in your stock. If this sounds like it works for you then by all means grab some. I am glad I found it."
4903,MadMadMike,Bigfoot,4.1,"12 ounce bottle, fridge chilled. Dark amber, khaki foam.
Aroma is a bit all over and it takes a moment to call out the pine and malt and woods.
Taste is malty and hops balanced at first drink, then comes apart on the palate., caramel, pine, white pepper. Solid bitterness. Alcohol is present, as it should be for the American Barleywine style.
Feel is mid-weight, mid-carb.
Overall, good sud, a little busy, but not in a bad way. Better as it warms."
4904,MNJR,Bigfoot,4.07,"Big flavors, thick, grainy consistency. Dry and bitter, malt heavy first impression then the hops kick in with a piny and powdery finish. Some bitter gentian root flavors (cocktail bitters), a little too much sometimes. Raisins. Herbal. Mild sweetness is beaten back by the massive malt and hops. Very similar to a double or triple IPA. If you like big and bitter, this is it."
4905,whitro17,Bigfoot,4.81,"Look - deep amber, aggressive pour for a 2"" tan head, little lacing left after this session
Smell - woody, malty, piney, floral, spicy
Taste - toasted malt, sweet caramel, hoppy, black pepper, piney, citrus
Feel - medium body and carbonation, sticky piney resinous finish, peppery
Overall - My first Barleywine and I'm very impressed. There is some serious hop nectar going on here. Flavor is very rich, almost like you're drinking the hops extract concentrate straight from the can and the enormous malt body brings the balance of toasted malt and a bit of sweet caramel. This brew is right up my alley with intense hoppy, piney, bitter traits that linger after every sip. Originally I bought one to try and that turned into buying a couple of six packs after I did try it. I'm gonna save a few to age and drink them in the years to come. Bigfoot is definitely a beast so take your time and pair it with the long classic, Do You Feel Like We Do from the Frampton Comes Alive! album. Enjoy!"

4915,Sabtos,Dale's Pale Ale,4.23,"Lightly foggy classic amber with a fairly tall off-white head that leaves spongy foam on the glass

It's been quite a minute since I've had this, and it's a lot more complex than I remember. It doesn't just consist of simple citrus and pine. Though those are present, they're subtle, as are notes of cologne and perhaps kiwi, while there is minimal malt expression. It's even a little peachy at times.

The very pleasant mouthfeel is what I'm most impressed by. A tingly fizz stops short of filling a medium body before coming to a semi-dry finish.

I'm substantially upping my age old 3.41 score after deleting that review entirely. No bonus points for starting the craft beer canning revolution, though it was cool being in the original place in person."

4918,Robo67,Blue Moon Belgian White,2.57,This beer falls just short of middle of the pack for me. Nice color decent head that dissipates quickly and leaves no lacing at all. Sign of a bad beer right there! However. It has a good mouth feel and goes down easily with more taste and less carbonation like Budweiser or any of the other big American mass produced beers. Every beer I opened had sediment on the bottom. Probably left over yeast that wasn't completely filtered out. I stopped short of having more than 3 out of a 12 pack because I'm 99.9% sure this beer would have given me the sharts. If you are just having a beer or 2 with dinner or lunch it would be a decent mid range beer of choice but if you are looking to drink a 6 pack or more to warp the brain I'd suggest you find something else. I've had worse but won't bother with this one again.
4919,JohnniEMc,Blue Moon Belgian White,2.44,"At cellar temperature, the pour to empty the contents of two brown twelve ounce bottles produces too much foam. That's expected from a wheat based beer. Now in a clear glass liter mug, the foam adopts just a tint of the color of the brew. That would be opaque and dark apricot-amber. After some of the foam recedes, it's not a bad looking beer. The esters and almost stale and metallic characters within the smell indicate that there's plenty of wheat involved here. As such there is only a watery body, ergo not much of a backbone. The only thing that mitigates that is there's no real bite to put this out of balance. Since there's no added fruit in this sample, there's not much to taste, except for the level of hopping you can get from a Coors Banquet. There's some good to that, as the stale and metallic taste of some in this style is almost unnoticed. No sustaining head, no glass lacing and no character makes this a bad choice. Sure, there are worse, Corona for example. But this is certainly In the don't bother category."

85 days old
Smell of citrus and pine
Light amber color
Medium mouthfeel
Medium carbonation
Taste of alcohol dominates with some citrus and bitterness flavors
Overall not that great. I think high ABV beers that hide their alcohol well are good so this isn't it. Very unbalanced. Would not buy again."
4931,Greymane,HopDevil,3.56,Not as good as I remembered it from back in '08.
4932,papawag,HopDevil,3.13,"From a fresh tapped sixtel keg. ...Tastes like an experiment. If there was a target, they missed it. Has a lot of good in it, but the combination doesn't work. Sort of like an Oktoberfest or Marzan trying to be a high gravity/bubbly IPA. But it looks luscious, creamy head, nice nose, but then goes South."
4933,TurboMon_911,HopDevil,4.38,Poured a semi-lucid copper color from a 12 oz. bottle (Best by Feb. 15 23) into a standard pint glass with a creamy barley colored finger high head that clings to the glass as it recedes. Aroma is mainly malty with overtones of cereal grain and grapefruit. Taste is bitter throughout but very well balanced with the malty sweetness and spicy alcohol flavor on the follow through. The bitterness lingers with creamy thickness in the mouth for this medium to full bodied brew. There is even a nice carbonation tingle on the tongue. It's been so long since I've had one of these that I had forgotten how good they are. This is an iconic ale that lives up to the hype.
4934,DrOfGolf,HopDevil,4.05,"Pours out an amber color with a nice thick head. The taste is somewhat fruity and truly different. Some notes of fruit, like blackberry or blueberry with a hoppy finish. All in all a great tasting beer."
4935,ThePold,HopDevil,3.73,"Maybe I'm drinking from a mis tapped keg, but this was too malty and dark for me. Wanted a hop bomb, got a malt grenade"
4936,tekstr1der,HopDevil,4.1,"Tasty traditional IPA from Victory, this might be my favorite from the brewer. Great balance of hop bite and malt backbone. Would look for this fresh again."

24oz can served in a big stein. 23325322322 is the date on the bottom of the can. @jonphisher sent it to me. I have had this before, but maybe not since around 2008.

Pours a clear umber color with a big, two finger head, that settles into a clumpy layer with chunky lacing. Smell is yeasty, light breadiness, a little bit of nut or toffee.

Taste is kind of similar. Yeast and breadiness are definitely still there, but nuttiness is more noticeable. There's an earthy bitterness and just a hint of honey sweetness.

Mouthfeel is light, very dry. Overall...better than I expected. Not an out-of-the-park home run, but I wouldn't be sad to drink this at a tailgate or a non-craft-beer friend's party. I could interchange it pretty happily with Hamm's for some variety."
4947,defunksta,Traditional Lager,3.7,"Appearance: Pours a completely clear, deep golden/orange color with a strong white head. SRM of 11. (4.00)

Aroma: Strong aromas of rich bread upfront. There's some tamed caramel and toasted notes to support. (4.00) 

Flavor: Flavor has more rich bread and yeast. Milder on the caramel than the aroma. Finishes mildly toasted. Malty, bready, yeasty. (3.50) 

Feel: Medium body, strong carbonation. Malty, yeasty, and full. (3.75) 

Overall: Haven't reviewed this one yet. Claimed to be America's Oldest Brewery. This is a smooth drinking Amber lager. Pours beautifully. Nice aromas including caramel and toast. Starts to fall off the flavor though. Rich bread, yeast, and sort of like an AAL after that. A good beer for what it is as an alternative to macro AALs. Glad to have tried it. (Rating: 3.70)"

Before it was sold in Ohio (about 2008?), any friend or family traveling to Pennsylvania would bring back a case or two of Yuengling Traditional Lager.

4951,ElijahLep,Traditional Lager,3.57,Solid lager. I like the malty-ness of it. Has a nice color and leaves lacing. Not really anything wrong with it. Definitely worth buying if you want something fairly cheap and solid.

4955,Whyteboar,Victory At Sea - Coffee And Vanilla,4.44,"Poured very dark brown and capped with an ambitious light brown head that climbed three inches very quickly.
The aroma to my chemically damaged nose was mild but still featured proper porter smells- roasted malts, coffee, a touch of chocolate.
The taste- I grabbed the can again to verify, but vanilla plays top position. Not sweet at all, but no mistaking there is vanilla in here. Coffee shows up later, this drinks true as it warmed.
The feel was good, ideal even. Not sure if it could be better. Ideally viscous.
OA- very happy to have been able to try this finally!"
4956,griffinwelsh,Victory At Sea - Coffee And Vanilla,4.97,If you've ever wondered what could make a great porter even better it is notes of vanilla. This beer has a rich coffee flavor and a satisfyingly vanilla aftertaste. Color is dark and consistency is very smooth. It's a shame I can't buy it in Texas.
4957,sjrider,Victory At Sea - Coffee And Vanilla,4.43,Can pour- dark as night with foamy khaki head leaving frosty/foamy lacing and a ring of bubbles. Nose is vanilla and coffee for days. Taste follows with some roasty malt and mild espresso bitterness. Vanilla lingers on the finish. Tasty.
4958,Beersnake,Victory At Sea - Coffee And Vanilla,4.21,"2021 release from can. Poured from fridge temp. Pours black with a really good amount of light brown head. Sticks around for quite a while as well. Nose is incredible. Vanilla, marshmallow, coffee, dark chocolate, red licorice, burnt toffee, and a nice amount of dark fruit. The taste nicely follows the nose, but with a distinct bitterness on the back end. Vanilla and coffee (very dark) are dominant. Definitely some charred wood, black licorice, roasted malts, almonds, and tar. Not sweet at all. Mouthfeel is fairly thick. Overall a really nice coffee stout."
4959,Rug,Victory At Sea - Coffee And Vanilla,4.37,"After being impressed by the High West BA version of this a few weeks ago I figured I'd give this a shot. Quite affordable at $3 for a single bottle given it currently sits at #323 of all time on this site

Pours a very dark brown with just a finger of espresso colored head that quickly fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing and decent legs

The aroma here is sweet but not overly so, bringing a nice balance of vanilla, hazelnut, toast, milk chocolate, medium roast coffee, and a slight dark fruit note

A bittersweet balance is maintained throughout the entire sip, starting off with notes of cocoa powder, lightly toasted malt, raisin, and a touch of grain alcohol. The swallow makes this one a bit sweeter, bringing notes of rich vanilla, slightly astringent coffee, milk chocolate, and almond

A medium silky body pairs with gentle carbonation for a smooth slow sipper. The finish is mostly dry, due to the roasty character of the coffee

Damn delicious beer right here. It hits all the notes expected and doesn't feel overly sweet or strong despite the high abv. I'd definitely get it again"
4960,CObrewsbaby,Milk Stout,4.61,One of my favorite stouts.
4961,cjgiant,Milk Stout,3.9,"On nitro (first try in a long time):
A nice line of stark contrast between the black body and creamy tan head, once the nitro settles out. Nose is dark chocolate, as is the taste. Even for a milk stout, this was a little sweeter up front than I expected. The middle turns a little more mocha with a decent dose of creamer. Finish continues the journey towards distinctly roasted malt and more balance, though there’s still a lingering sweetness.

This isn’t a beer exhibiting pastry-style sweetness, but would work better as an after dinner / with dessert beer. Nice malt flavors and a smooth, creamy feel (though the nitro is obviously an influence here)."
4962,mvanaskie13,Milk Stout,4.13,"Poured into a snifter: color is black, head is light tan, head presents one finger thick and then dissipates to thin top, spotty lacing. 

Smell is light sweet chocolate, roast malt, lactose sweetness, earthy bitterness. 

Taste is chocolate, roast, lactose sweetness, bitter chocolate, maybe some earthy bitterness. 

Mouthfeel is low carbonation, moderate sweetness, low/moderate bitterness, pretty smooth with the added lactose. 

Overall a very pleasant lightly sweet milk stout - these can lean overly sweet but this is well executed with light sweetness and moderate chocolate."
4963,1BrewBacca,Milk Stout,3.75,"Pretty good brew but somewhat mediocre. As in nothing really stands out to make this exceptional.
That's not to say it's bad in any way. Just that there are much better brews on the market."
4964,puck1225,Milk Stout,3.83,"I had this beer poured from draft into a shaker pint. Flat dark brown color with good head and lacing. Smell and taste of milk chocolate. Smokey, earthy and very easy to drink. Nice feel for the style. 

Actually surprised I had not reviewed before."
4965,Jmsandberg17,Milk Stout,3.86,"12oz bottle pours a very deep brown-black color with a small cap of dark tan-colored head that recede to a thick ring around the edge of the glass while leaving a small amount of lacing. Smells of dark, roasted malts and 
rich chocolate. Taste is very rich on roasted and charred malt notes, dark chocolate, milk chocolate, and coffee with a hint of caramel, toffee, and dark fruits. The flavor is very robust and deep with a noticeable but by no means overpowering sweetness and a slightly astringent, burnt bitterness to close. Full-bodied with a very luxurious smooth (almost syrupy) mouthfeel and subtle carbonation.

This was a very tasty and well-balanced milk stout. Definitely not overly bitter like many American stouts, nor overwhelmingly sweet like many milk stouts. Have had this beer before and will certainly buy again."
4966,mcm180,Milk Stout,4.01,"Pours into my Guinness glass quite dark. Brown-black with a thin ring, not really a head. 

I can’t smell anything. (Bad air these days.)

Tastes sweet. Almost like cola. But nicely dark-beer roasty. The alcohol isn’t very noticeable. Malty. No bitterness for me. 

Feels thin and light. Lightly carbonated. 

Overall, pretty good. Better as it warms."
4967,beerwithmeIRL,Milk Stout,4.11,"440ml Can - Pours black with a 1.5 finger cream head with decent retention. Onthe nose it's fairly sweet with a touch of coffee. Up front, it tastes of roasted malted barley and coffee followed by a hint of dark chocolate (with a very subtle bitterness) and vanilla. Overall, it's very sweet and enjoyable."
4968,Christianriveraaa,Milk Stout,4.04,"Pouring straight into a snifter - minimal head appearing.
Aromas of sweet milk chocolate, coffee, molasses and malts.
Definitely tastes as advertised but isn't as sweet as one expects. Getting malts/molasses upfront followed by coffee and a nice roasty coffee ending.
Feel is so smooth due to the nitrogen, easy to sip, can't taste that 6% at all in this.
I tried this in the beginning stages of trying stouts but can decipher it a lot better and have to say this is still a good treat to have. Try this if your beginning to try stouts and you'll love it."
4969,taxandbeerguy,Milk Stout,4.15,"404ml can served cold into a pint glass. LCBO purchase for around $4 CDN,

Appearance - dark brown color, close to a finger of dense, fluffy tan head. Great staying power.

Smell - Lots of dark chocolate a hint of raisins and some coffee backing everything up. Good intensity.

Taste - Semi sweet chocolate with some coffee in the aftertaste. I get Glosette Raisins mid sip. Pretty delicious stuff, mildly bitter with nice sweet centre.

Mouthfeel - Medium full bodied and very creamy.

Overall - An excellent milk stout, one of the very best that is widely available. Glad to have finally tried now that a batch has come to Ontario."
4970,JZH1000,Milk Stout,4.09,"Poured from a 12oz bottle best by 02/05/2023

On the pour one finger of fine tan head formed then recedes to a decent covering and ring that leaves nice lacing, but continues dissipating. Body is a solid black even up to light, I wish there was a bit more head though.

Aroma is dark and smooth. Like a better, sweeter, and ever so slightly fruitier guiness. Dark chocolate with a hint of roast, verging on coffee with some sweet malty notes make up this one. Slight hops are present but they blend in nicely and are mostly bittering.

Taste follows the aroma with even more roasty almost bitter malts that are quickly balanced by a molasses dark chocolate sweetness. The roast comes out even more in the finish with true and smooth roasty barley making up the aftertaste, retaining some sweetness.

Feel is laid back, smooth, and easy drinking, but still has that cozy ""vibe"" that a good stout should bring. Not too thick or syrupy but still quite full. Quite attenuated despite the sweetness and is almost dry bit not quite with a slight mouthcoating maltiness.

Overall this was exactly what I was looking for. For a slightly chilly early fall night, after drinking too many lagers, a nice dark ale was in order, but I didn't want too many hops or to go too heavy. This is close to refreshing but has a laid back armchair vibe to it as well. Versatile, refreshing, and roasty."
4971,Robo67,Budweiser,1.14,Half beer and done. Over carbonated flavor is of what old wet socks smells like. You are better off buying a cheap bottle of vodka and mixing it with any kind of soda! For real!! Every beer that cost less that I've ever had is better than this garbage. I guess the reason this cost more is because of the extensive marketing. Obviously marketing fools the fools!
4972,Mardinae,Budweiser,1.56,The worst of the American big three
4973,Coolbreez,Budweiser,1.3,This is not the same Bud that I drank as a underaged kid in the 60's and of age in the 70's. Bud used to have a unique taste that was easily recognizable even if you were blindfolded. Unfortunately not surprising since InBev bought the Bush's out. One word to describe this swill - lousy.
4974,Beer_Emperer,Budweiser,1.06,Highly carbonated with very little taste. The rice doesn't help it at all. Actually don't feel to good after drinking it either.
4975,TheRealBen,Budweiser,3,The standard comparison for the massive volume of production of American lagers.
4976,Luscious_Malfoy,Budweiser,3.86,"draft pour into standard shaker pint glass. straw gold, barely any foam but a nice sweat on the glass that makes it seem like it could be a refreshing beverage. heavy malt on the nose. bready, lightly sweet but also a little musty too. taste is light, musty oak, lagery malt and yeast. it’s not super clean. more borderline ethanol or malt liquor type flavors. decent mouthfeel actually. it’s heavy.. too heavy for the abv but it’s not bad."
4977,Nath91,Budweiser,1.77,"Budweiser. It's the most famous of all American beers. Probably. You go to any country in the world and ask what an American beer is, the answer you'll get I'm sure more than anything is Budweiser. It's to America as what VB is to Australia. It's not a beer that is particularly popular in Australia, and much to my surprise I noticed on this bottle I have purchased that it's actually now brewed under license, here in Australia by Carlton & United Breweries. When that happened, I don't know, but it's still not a super popular beer outside I'm sure of the American ex-pat population (the smart ones probably don't drink it - it's probably just brewed for the ever-increasing US military personal Prescence in Australia.) Further more, this beer brewed under license is not the 5% ABV it is in America (and from the one time I had it during the 2018 FIFA world cup at Cheers Bar in Sydney) - it's now a rather modest, 4.5% ABV. This I'm sure is going to affect the overall quality even further. So, here goes nothing. 

Purchased at the Glenfield Bottle Shop in Sydney. There is a date on the label of 24 September, 2023. So this is either about 2 months fresh, or 2 months out of date. Who knows? 

Appearance: 
Typical lager look. Golden appearance. Head disappeared before I could really get a look at it properly. Lots of carbonation bubbles in the glass. Looks like a lager. Say no less, say no more. 

Aroma: 
Light toasted malt, some faint hop aroma, although being brewed under License now Carlton & United might have chucked in some Pride of Ringwood hops for shits n giggle. Not a whole load of smell to the beer, 

Taste: It doesn't taste bad, it just doesn't taste of much. It's very sweet, some ever so slight bitterness that leads to an unnatural dryness in the mouth. Nothing flavourwise in terms of hop. Just sweet soda water, with a rather unnatural dryness. Again, it doesn't taste bad, it just really doesn't have a taste. 

Feel. Highly carbonated, thin, watery. It's beer flavored soda water. Sweet soda water. You know how you get flavored mineral waters, lime, lemon, and the lime, lemon is this artificial flavoring, well replace that with 'malty beer flavoring' and this would pass on the supermarket shelf next to your flavored mineral waters. It's smooth, it's drinkable. 

Overall: I'm not one of these craft beer snobs that hates adjunct lagers for the sake of hating them. But Budweiser, whether it's brewed in America in brewed in Australia, it's just boring. I dislike Australian adjunct lagers, because they all taste the same and use Pride of Ringwood hops. I'm crying out for some PoR hop in this. It's bland, boring, and that's why i'm giving it such a bad score. It's a boring beer, at least Aussie adjunct have some flavour and characteristics. This is just boring.

4978,LeinenkugelDrinker,Budweiser,1.19,Piss in a can. I usually am forced to consume a couple a year. That’s ok though. Reminds me not purchase it. I remember first drinking it and thinking “why does this taste so fucking salty?” Flavorless shit
4979,FreePal88,Budweiser,1.5,"So flavorless you might as well just be drinking Bud Light. But if you're drinking Bud Light you might as well just be drinking a bit of malt liquor, because you're sure not drinking it for the flavor. Not the worst thing in the world, but very close to as bad as it gets. I'm not anti-lager, I'm not anti-light beer, I'm not ""IPA only,"" Budweiser just fucking sucks, even for what it is."
4980,Deaconmark,Budweiser,2.97,I am going to rate it since I was at a bar that only has it in bottles. Pours very loose no dense head. Smells a bit sweet but nothing wrong or outstanding. First taste is all sweep no feeling of depth in character. No real malt or hops that stands out. However in all fairness is does not taste bad at all. The beer snobs just thumbs down but in reality it has no off flavors. Have to remember this is not Bud Light. But this is another review.
4981,Greymane,Budweiser,1.21,"This has to be my least favorite beer in the world. The congener levels, mainly aldehydes and ketones are a guarantee of a splitting headache. AB-INBEV sure makes a consistently bad beer. Pours yellow with little lacing or head, thin and watery taste with a grassy aroma when cold, but smells like something foul when warm. I actually thought I was allergic to beer, but it was just American Adjunct Lagers made by the large US manufacturers. Speed of production leaves too many fermentation byproducts that shouldn't still be there."
4982,Dylan184183,Budweiser,3.16,"It taste sweet for some reason, like unnaturally sweet. I don't understand why, and I don't like it."
4983,MutuelsMark,Punkin Ale,3.65,"Advance warning, pumpkin beers are not my thing. This beer is golden with an off white to slightly golden hued head. Nose smells like a light lager in my opinion. Taste was ok, just ok. This is a decent beer for what it is, nothing more or less."
4984,milkshakebeersucks,Punkin Ale,3.98,"Clear, deep amber body sports a large off white head with good lacing. Warm, autumnal aroma loaded up with the usual array of fall baking spices. Earthy taste hangs on to that sweet and spicy image. Nicely carbonated, medium bodied mouthfeel. If you are okay with the style, this is a good one."
4985,tucson_brewson,Punkin Ale,4.29,"12 oz can poured into a pint glass.

L - Pours a clear, copper-amber color with a thin, white lacing that dissipates throughout the session.

S - Smells like autumn, lots of cinnamon, nutmeg, and pumpkin up front, caramel, biscuit malt, some hops but the sweetness dominates.

T - Follows the nose with spice, pumpkin, caramel sugary sweetness at the start, but balanced out nicely with biscuit malt and spicy hops.

F - Light-bodied, moderate carbonation, very drinkable so it sneaks up on you at 7% ABV. 

O - I don’t drink many pumpkin/fall beers but felt in the mood and this offered that perfect balance of spicy, sweet, and bitter. I’ll try this again next fall."
4986,Lanoke12,Punkin Ale,4.48,"Great pumpkin ale with full fall flavor. A great beer to drink on a crisp night sitting by the jack o lantern. The flavor is full bodied, with a rich amber look, spicy smell, and think feel."

Mouthfeel is a joy to behold
Overall this is probably the best punkin ale l ever had! This is not a Halloween trick but a treat!"
4988,AleManDan,Punkin Ale,4.02,"This is good! Not really my style, but it looks glowingly amber-light brown in the light in the small goblet glass I am using.

NOSE:
Smells like a dark lager with some non-descript hops and spice flavors and maybe pumpkin. Smells like a stronger, better Modelo Negro to me, bready and biscuity and sweet with that tangy spicy, hoppy note. Hmmm...

TASTE:
Follows nose with more pronounced pumpkiny flavor, with a nice hop profile and many other notes typical of this style. For me it's a nice balance between a dark lager and a brown ale. 

MOUTHFEEL:
Nice! Seemingly big and bold because of the contrasting strong flavors, but overall the actual mouthfeel is medium and then medium to dry at the finish line. I like the way it leaves you with that lager style desire for another sip.

OVERALL:
Once again, this is a bit out of my wheel house, but this is a fun and delicious beer for the fall time."

4997,Blogjackets,DirtWolf,4.29,"Poured from a twelve ounce bottle, the body is an orange-brown. Very clear. Fluffy white head that creates a ring at the edge. Good lacing. Nice looking beer. 

Aroma is a light citrus, grass and light pine. A wee note of bread dough. 

Taste follows nose briefly then a nice hop bitterness. The malt, vaguely honey flavored, nicely balances this bite and the swallow dries up smoothly. No sign of the ABV in the taste, but it is most definitely felt. 

Good mouthfeel as the carbonation is solid and the beer is soft on the palate. 

An easy drinking 8.7% beer that I imagine would be fabulous on tap. Catch this one fresh as it is an excellent beer."
4998,highdesertdrinker,DirtWolf,4.04,"Pours a rich, deep gold with ample head. Smells fairly predictable for the style: herbal, hoppy, some citrus perhaps. The flavor is herbal hop smack from the first sip, bitter, the citrus and fruit flavors make their presence as it warms up, decent malt, and of course it packs a wallop but still reasonable at 8.7% This was my go shelf Double IPA for about 2 years but I haven’t seen it out here for several years now and it tastes a little different than I remember but another solid beer from Victory, cheers!"

5001,travis1108,Dragon's Milk Bourbon Barrel-Aged Stout,3.86,I'm not usually into the bourbon barrel crap so this is a very good score from me. It is not overly sickly sweet like most of them. Has a vanilla flavor that is nice. Good mouth feel. Solid for a beer period but excellent so far as barrel aged goes.
5002,harrypowers,Dragon's Milk Bourbon Barrel-Aged Stout,4.17,"Pours an opaque brown color with a 1/2F tan head with moderate lacing.

Smells mof chocolate and bourbon.

Tastes of sweet toasted malt, dark chocolate, coffee, bourbon, cinnamon and vanilla with a lightly bitter, decidedly boozy warm finish.

Medium heavy body with light carbonation. Lush, syrupy and smooth mouthfeel.

This is a very strong, flavorful sipping brew that mellows as one's glass warms."
5003,Rwoodroffe,Dragon's Milk Bourbon Barrel-Aged Stout,4.08,Very dark with minimal dark colored head. Smell is unimpressive and flavor is not super sweet but more earthy with vanilla undertones.
5004,sentrytec,Dragon's Milk Bourbon Barrel-Aged Stout,3.32,Not bad if you like Count Chocola and getting drunk.
5005,augustgarage,Dragon's Milk Bourbon Barrel-Aged Stout,3.81,"Bottled on September 11th, 2023 - enjoyed on November 24th, 2023 - poured from a 12oz bottle into my snifter. 

Opaque black bean body with a dense wheat/almond cap receding to a lasting collar and surface slick. Fine lacing; very good retention; light glassy sheen of legs. 

Baker's chocolate, molasses, and brown bread from the malt joined by tobacco and vanilla from the barrel. Fairly one-dimensional yet inviting. 

Rich malty palate entry with licorice and char joining the flavors that follow the nose. Medium finish never quite dries out, though there is some faintly acrid acidity from the barrel. A touch boozy hints of cherry and tar. Low bitterness throughout.

Somewhat hot, medium-bodied, but smooth rather than sticky.

A decent, affordable barrel-aged stout, though it lacks nuance/balance compared to the best versions of the style."
5006,JohnniEMc,Dragon's Milk Bourbon Barrel-Aged Stout,4.46,"A dark brown bottle which contained 22 ounces has been emptied into a clear glass liter mug. That should be enough. The liquid gets the close enough to the black coffee brown color description. There's a very thin tan head. The aroma brings coffee, roasted malt, tannins and just a little alcohol. Although the tannins are there to taste, they're reserved enough to let other flavors emerge. The potent alcohol is nicely incorporated into the overall and is really only noticed during the finish. Those two concerns, either of which could ruin a decent Imperial Stout, are definitely set aside. That makes this a remarkable brew. It's always an impressive brewing feat to get this much alcohol in a beer, with only a little notice of it. Especially when it's Bourbon barrel aged, there's a good chance it's going to taste like a boilermaker made with a Stout. Most beer lovers don't want that and this doesn't. There's almost some dark chocolate and coconut sweetness to it and of course, that black coffee taste reference many Stouts give. Most of these flavor levels are modest and the body could be just a little fuller, if there is to be a criticism. Although the glass lacing isn't copious, it's stratified to mark each episode liquid left the vessel. Sometimes it's a shame there's so much alcohol in a beer, because at the end of the glass, it seemed like a good idea to have another. But, it wasn't."
5007,Oktoberfest,Dragon's Milk Bourbon Barrel-Aged Stout,5,"The OG. The pater familias. The alpha and the omega.

Everyone is entitled to their opinion. But if this isn't up your alley, please understand that you are wrong. Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong."
5008,meast007,Dragon's Milk Bourbon Barrel-Aged Stout,3.68,"First taste amazing, drank out of a bottle unable to admire the look. The feel was nice and smooth as it traverse down. Really love the tast would have ranked higher if it were colder pretty sure, it has a nice stout taste, again very smooth."
5009,HoppyBastard,Bud Light,1.1,"Poured from a 12 ounce can into a Shaker pint glass, best by date ""03JUN24"".

APPEARANCE: pours a clear, light golden color with one-finger white head that quickly dissipated until there was almost nothing, a small partial ring of small bubbles remained around the rim of glass, it reminded me of a soda pop, there is no lacing on the glass, medium carbonation.

SMELL: it smells faintly like sweet corn and bread.

TASTE: the taste follows the nose, initially sweet corn then bread, it's very bland and the flavors are understated.

PALATE: this beer is thin and watery with a very light body and medium carbonation.

OVERALL: This is the worst beer I have ever tasted, it tastes like nothing, it's does not have an unpleasant or off-putting taste, it's just really bland and boring, I don't understand why anyone would buy or drink this beer when there are so many better choices, the only positive things I can say is it's relatively low in calories and alcohol."
5010,Lanoke12,Bud Light,2.85,"Look is light straw yellow. Smell is of light adjunct malts and hops. Taste is inoffensive and smooth. Feel is light bodied. Overall, a decent light lager for when you want to take a break from craft beer."
5011,Athener56,Bud Light,1.47,should be classified as a seltzer. has no aftertaste whatsoever and no flavor which makes it very unenjoyable for me. others may appreciate that.

5013,lflotron,Bud Light,4.58,Don't know why this is so poorly rated. Easy to drink without much taste.
5014,Greymane,Bud Light,1.02,Carbonated yellow water with hop extract and rubbing alcohol aroma. How can they sell this swill?
5015,Alpha-Leader,Bud Light,1,"Bud Light is what turned me off from beer for years. Grew up thinking, ""If that is what beer is, I don't want it."""
5016,FreePal88,Bud Light,1.17,"The Bud Light of beer. Tastes like corn and baby food. Wouldn't drink one for free. Well I might, but weighing the low but not negligible calories against my (non-)enjoyment, I'd probably just pass."
5017,guitarguyny,Hoptimum,3.67,Not the hop bomb I was expecting. Has a annoying malty/sweetness to it that I don’t care for. I was hunting this down for a while and I was let down.
5018,aficionado224,Hoptimum,4.15,"For anyone looking for the stronger styles this one fits the bill. Making stronger ale needs more hops to balance out the vast quantities of malt and they succeed, making that name appropriate."
5019,whitro17,Hoptimum,4.62,"Look - deep gold, solid white head, little lacing
Smell - dank ripe fruit, piney, citrus
Taste - sweet fruit, piney, hoppy, resinous
Feel - medium body, moderate carbonation, highly resinous sticky finish
Overall - This is one hoppy Mutha. A tale of two halves to this gem. She's a bit boozy at first and the juicy fruitiness is more present on the scent and taste. It's like a hoppy, juicy, candy-esque treat. As it breathes and warms, it shifts to the piney, hoppy, resinous flavor with some citrus to balance it out. If you're looking for your hop fix, this is it. Let it warm, sip and enjoy. Ratchet up Blue Oyster Cult and zero in on Godzilla for this monster."
5020,BeerIsGood1337,Hoptimum,3.35,"2023 version.

Pretty average. Not impressed with this one. A vaguely annoying sweetness is going on here, and it's just overall not that interesting of a brew.

A perfectly drinkable beer. Nice and crisp, but I can't find anything I really love about it. Not much complexity. I can think of many other IPAs I'd rather be drinking.

Somewhat heavy ABV at 11%. One bottle will have you feeling a buzz, so don't have too many of these..."
5021,crm871,Hoptimum,4.57,"Look: Poured into snifter. Burnt orange in color with a fluffy beige-colored head.

Smell: Strong notes of citrus fruits - orange in particular. Strong hoppy aromas as well. Very dank but also has a sweetness to it as well that makes for a really pleasant smell.

Taste: Powerful hoppy front, nice bitterness that you’d expect and it really bites down on you. Citrus fruits follow - I’m getting the orange from the nose plus lemon, malts, some barley, and then there’s a really nice bitterness after the baseline taste finishes. All in all it has a very imperial taste to it, and it’s superb.

Feel: Heavy on this one - it’s 11% ABV and tastes / feels imperial. The carbonation is medium but it sits heavy. Take your time with this one and sip it steadily.

Overall: Wonderful offering that I’d buy again."

taste is massive tropical and floral"
5023,MadMadMike,Hoptimum,3.79,"12 ounce bottle dated 4-13-23, poured fridge cold into a Wasatch Brewing can-glass. 
Generous foam rises above an orange tinted bronze brew. A little sticky lace manages its way throughout the drink.
Aroma is disappointing., it’s not as mighty as it should be for a huge TIPA.
Taste is a tad confusing; it’s not this big hoppy dank bomb I was expecting / hoping for. The sweetness is annoying. There’s a hint of bitterness trying to surface but the sweet kicks it back down.
Mouth is nicely dense, mid carbonation.
Overall, points for reaching SW Florida at just 5 weeks since bottling. But damn. This should be so much more in every department - except the buzz. A pair of these gets the cheeks red. That may be its saving grace.,."

1+ finger white head with very good retention, leaves behind some thin wisps of lacing early. Orange-gold body with great clarity. Big nose of candied orange, late mint, and sweet malt. Sweet fruit - fruit salad with berries, tropical, and some ripe citrus. Full body, creamy mouthfeel - no real heat but the 11% is apparent. Long finish with some lingering sweetness. Very Good."

Citrus, malt driven, hint of herbal and earth nose. It keeps drawing you back in with it's fragrance and elegance.
Malty caramel palate with touch of grassy hop bitterness, uniquely refreshing, earthy, herbal, bready with hint of spice finish.
Light body but good weight, clean, smooth, engaging, very crushable.
It is sad to see this iconic beer go."
5028,highdesertdrinker,Anchor Steam Beer,4.02,"Pours a handsome rich copper gold with a decent pillowy white head. The smell is biscuit and grain with a hint of hop. The taste is some caramel, biscuit, grain, a little bitterness, and a decent malt backbone. It's very balanced, drinkable, and refreshing and had 2 of these after the Diamondbacks baseball game in Phoenix at Hanny's in downtown and sorry to see it go if it is indeed gone."

5031,dd53grif,Anchor Steam Beer,3.87,Pours a copper color with a minimal head that lasts quite a while. Aroma is floral notes and roasted malts. Taste is peppery with a slightly bitter finish. Had to try this one while it was still available in the stores.

Taste: Clean and crisp. Hints of malt and caramel.
Mouthfeel: Light-medium-bodied with moderate carbonation.
Overall: I am extremely saddened to hear of Anchor Steam closing down (after 127 years): This is the end of an iconic American beer and brewery. I feel lucky to have had the opportunity to drink this beer on tap when it was still available."

5035,1009,Anchor Steam Beer,3.64,"A sad day indeed. We long ago sipped and enjoyed many an Anchor product. Several were taken down during the first few weeks of the covid lockdowns as there really wasn’t much else to do other than try new beer. We never put the beer into words. From memory though, Steam was a fantastic sipping beverage with its profile defining bitter hoppy bite. The history and tradition, you could taste it. A real shame to hear earlier this week about the full closing of the brewery. The Christmas ale was a staple of the holidays for the past number of year. A very sad day. Pour one out for Fritz."

5037,Foxbush,Sculpin - Grapefruit,4.04,"12 oz can from Total Wine and More in Short Pump, VA This is a one-of-a-kind ale along with Sculpin. A go-to beer for all times. The ale pours a clear amber with a white foamy head and lacing. The noticeable aroma is citrus mostly grapefruit is nicely balanced. The mouthfeel is smooth with excellent body and texture. The ale has a medium body with average carbonation."
5038,HalfFull,Sculpin - Grapefruit,3.03,"Yet another beer that has been destroyed by being bought out? Pour is deep copper to light amber, much deeper than I recall 'back in the day'. Decent hop notes and some light lacing. This is fresh beer yet offers no grapefruit notes that existed in the past. Taste is a bit malty, subdued, pleasant yet unexciting. Pleasant hop character on the nose yet not stellar, finish is fairly soft for an IPA, lacking the bitterness it is known for. Warming does bring out just a hint of grapefruit though it is fleeting at best. Touch of hop spice on the close. A decent quaff but heading into the 'not worth the calories' realm of once great beers. Who owns this brand now? I don't know and they don't care. Utopia is behind us..."
5039,eWell,Sculpin - Grapefruit,4.83,This beer is impossible to get hold off where I live. It’s truly excellent and enhances the flavors of the Sculpin with slightly sour but more refreshing notes.
5040,AlCaponeJunior,Sculpin - Grapefruit,4.15,"My shock and horror to see that after all these years I hadn't reviewed sculpin grapefruit! Well no more. I love this beer, as grapefruit is a lovely way to compliment the biting hops of sculpin. Not for amateurs or posers, and BMC drinkers head's will aspolode upon the first sip. Similarly to arrogant bastard, keep this one away from the unsophisticated newbies."
5041,hbeimers,Sculpin - Grapefruit,4.56,Had to have while visiting San Diego. Perfect west coast IPA to drink while on the west coast. perfect amount of grapefruit and perfect sipability to the whole brew
5042,LoganFarinhas,Sculpin - Grapefruit,5,Not much to say... Beer like this makes me Hoppy! Absolutely delicious! Smell taste body is all 10/10
5043,dano213,Sculpin - Grapefruit,4.04,"12oz can purchased off the shelf as part of a mix-a-six pack for $2. PKG 07APR22, so this is almost four months old.

Look: Pours a very pretty copper color. Almost completely clear; just a very faint haze that appeared after I poured the bottom of the can. There was a thick, rocky off-white head that slowly reduced to a very thin layer.

Smell: I definitely smell the grapefruit aroma up front. It smells nice. Other fruity, caramelly, and herbal/vegetal notes but nothing distinctive besides grapefruit. After delving into it, I can detect nice apricot and orange zest aromas.

Taste: It's very tasty. Up front, there's grapefruit flavor with a bit of acidity. The mild, gentle initial grapefruit flavor explodes into an oily, bitter, pithy profile that attacks the sides of the tongue and the back of the palate. The finish is long, piney, resinous, and bitter with lots of grapefruit peel and pith. Eventually, I can detect a pleasant caramel malt sweetness after the bitterness subsides. Even though this beer is so bitter, I feel like there is an element of balance to it because along there's also a lot of caramel malt to help counteract the strong bitterness.

Feel: Medium bodied with an appropriate level of carbonation. Someone oil, slightly chewy mouthfeel.

Overall: This has got to be one of the quintessential West Coast IPAs. I tried regular Sculpin IPA many years ago, and I was utterly unprepared for how bitter it was. This is also very bitter, and I think that my palate has adjusted over the years and now embraces bitterness. This beer requires a palate adjustment for many folks, and that's okay because many folks' palates (and minds) need to be adjusted! It's also nice to see that this beer can hold up to Father Time; at almost four months old, it's still very aromatic and flavorful.

5048,EVH5150,Delirium Tremens,4.09,An absolute classic for a reason. I've always noticed a bit of cherry and a lot of clove in this beer and it's not as bitter as Duvel. This one needs to be served at cellar temp and not COLD in my experience. It makes a big difference in picking out the nuances of the yeast strain. An all-time favorite for me.

Deep, chocolate brown with a frothy, pale tan head of sticky foam.
Aroma is brown sugar and leather, chocolate malted milk and whiff of phenolic esters.
Flavor is robust for a brown ale and firmly bittered but not IPA IBU's, full of dark and caramel grain character.
Medium plus body with great balance of sweet and herb bite though a little bit cloying as it warms. 
This reminds me of Ubu Ale and Turbo Dog but bigger and better - with a hint of Kick Ass Brown hopiness.
Like most DFH beers, unique, off-style and memorable."
5051,eameslover,Indian Brown Ale,4,"First time I had ever seen this style...Really good! No joke, I could taste a stout, an IPA (not a lot but some distinctive hops) and a good brown ale. Mostly the first and last but it wasn't entirely one if the aforementioned styles. I really enjoyed it"

This beer is exceedingly sweet on the palate -- more so than any Belgian tripel I've had. Coriander can be delicious in beer when used carefully; here it is excessive. I don't find this beer very pleasant (hey, Victory, bring back your Helios saison and Moonglow dunkelweizenbock!). 

For a far better US-brewed tripel, try Great Divide's Orabelle."
5056,Saluki,Golden Monkey,4,"When in the mood for a high abv beer with some good flavors, this fits the bill. Has to be very cold for my taste. Publix has BOGO regularly and most times pass on it, but compared to the Sour, this Golden is preferred."
5057,milkshakebeersucks,Golden Monkey,4.14,"Pale gold pour matched with a small off white head and light lacing. Spicy aroma that pulls in notes of clove, banana and citrus.

5058,Roxchambeau,Golden Monkey,3.72,"It's not a Rochefort 8, but at 1/3 the price, a great beer. little to no head & lacing. Sweet, smooth banana and spice, with well hidden ABV. Possibly the best go-to, inexpensive, but still craft beer when in the mood for the style."

5061,highdesertdrinker,Golden Monkey,4.19,"I notice the rating as a little lower than I would have thought and my question is where are you gonna find a widely available American Tripel for this price and quality?! Pours a bright orange cold with nice head as per the style but doesn’t explode out of the glass. Smells funky, yeasty, moldy as expected. Taste is of the heralded spice, light clove and banana, some other fruit and a crisp hop bite at the end. It’s similar to Belgian ales but it’s also it’s own thing. A solid version of one of my favorite styles, kudos to Victory for this beer and I’ve said it before but it bears repeating; I like this brewery!"

500ml bottle procured in California and muled back to Idaho for future enjoyment. On a trip that featured North Parks award-winning hazies and my return to Pliny, Lunch was such a pleasant surprise...

A: Pours an effervescent gold, moderately clear with a touch of haze, slightly amber-ish in the glass with a towering, creamy cap of off-white head lacing. Glows with inviting warmth...elegant.

S: Pleasant, subtle, balanced...definite notes of lemon, grapefruit, citrus peel, pine....crackery biscuit, sweet bread, earth...herbal resin, orange juice.

T: Refined and unobtrusive; proportionate. Bready, citrus juice, rindy & piny bitterness blended with layers of dehydrated fruit and a mild earthy smoke. Impressively integrated and categorically expressive.

MF: Creamy, smooth, mild bitterness, pleasantly useful dryness; clean.

O: Wow; this one captivated me. It may not seem as though I am at a loss for words, but I am. This surprised me, not that it did anything out of the ordinary, but in that it did EVERYTHING so damn excellently for a WCIPA. I cannot imagine a more shining example of the style, approachable and yet expressive and complete with balance. Well done MBC."
5065,vickersspitfire,Lunch,4.71,"Pours out a semi cloudy golden color, reminds me of a hazy sun rise, the head is thick and fluffy and sticks around for a while. The aroma is very nice, lemon zest, grassy tones and herbal fragrances come through well balanced with a hint of malts that slowly grows stronger as it warms up. Lemon zest and sweetened oranges peel at first, very very tasty followed by some herbal flavors, malts and medium hops, this flavor leaves longing for another sip. Crisp for an IPA and very refreshing with no alcohol taste in the aftertaste. Very fun IPA to drink on a cold night."

Bright amber-orange , with light, off-white head. 

Smell is pine, grass, fresh orange and candied orange rind. 

Taste is grapefruit, grapefruit pith , pine, and a bit of orange rind near finish. Medium bitterness, that lingers awhile after finish. 

Feel is medium, lightly slick/oily at first, with moderate, sharp carbonation bite. Drying sensation after finish . 

Lives up to its reputation . Nice old-school IPA. A pleasure !"

Checked the score on BeerAdvocate, very promising, decided to give it a try. Early October 2023 bottling date, so fresh.

First taste was before taking any food. I thought, really good, reminds me of a well-known West Coast IPA from that Santa Rosa CA crew. Maybe a bit more malty than that IPA named after a certain Roman, but really nice hop flavor and a nice quick finish, which I appreciate. Score here on BA seems pretty spot-on to me. Had the rest after a nice meal, and my first impression was unchanged. Yummy and easy to like. Definitely a bit on the malty side, but me likey. Would be delighted to try this on tap somewhere."

The alcohol is well hidden among the bold characteristics of this beer. Delicious and highly recommended"

A - Solid black color, excellent tan, tight knit froth, lacing with each draw.
S - Bakers chocoalte, char, a bit of espresso, pine.
T - Again with the bakers chocolate, add a hint of orange rime, and piney, coffee with flourless chocoalate cake.
M - Medium in body, start is semi sweet then rolls toward and stays on the bitter side. Finish is ashen dry.
O - A new favorite for me, assertive, edgy, and with all the pieces of an American RIS. Thankful to have this in our area."
5077,izraelc,Storm King,4,Pours dark. Tan foam. Malty aroma. Big hop body. Fades to a malty goodness. Bitter finish. Im surprised how hoppy it is. Good balance of malt and hops. This ones a classic.
5078,1BrewBacca,Storm King,3.86,"Look: Pours like black coffee with a nice tan head with great retention. Sticky foam lace on the glass.
Taste and Smell: Strong espresso notes with a hint of chocolate. Somewhat bitter.
Feel: A full mouth oiliness going on.
Overall: Pretty good coffee imperial shout."
5079,Brutaltruth,Storm King,4.02,"From the 12 oz bottle in a snifter. This classic pours a dark blackish brown 
with a fantastic head of khaki foam that settles to a thick fat layer with excellent
lacing. Nose of dark cocoa, pine touched hops, dark coffee, and moderate char.
Flavors follow the nose nicely with dark bakers cocoa, char, coffee, and floral as
well as pine touched hops on the rear. Nice mouth feel; medium full body, smooth,
lightly creamy, and finishing with a char and bitter malt note balanced by strong
hops. 

Overall, a solid brew, a touch more hops than I remember, but solid all the same!

Cheers"
5080,moodenba,Storm King,3.94,"Victory Storm King is a well balanced stout, with elements of malt, roasted malt, and hoppy bitterness. The 9.1% alcohol content is well hidden. The flavor is more assertive than a Guinness Stout Nitro. I recently tasted a Carlow O'Hara Stout that was more aggressively flavored than Storm King, even having half the alcohol content. All things being equal, I'd prefer to drink two of the O'Haras than just one Storm King."
5081,deleted_user_995920,Storm King,3.89,"Pours an opaque deep dark black with a creamy/foamy mocha colored head. Deep roasted nuttiness,almost peanut butter scent, Taste is smoky, coffee,espresso even more. dark chocolate.Feels full bodied with enough carbonation.Finishes dank and chewy- Overall this is a stout that lets you know its a stout, An above average hop presence."
5082,irs,Storm King,4.37,"Label says best by Oct 22, 2022. Interesting since an imperial stout can get better with age.
reviews i've read lead me to expect something different in the nose, but the sweet, dark candy smell, betrays nothing about this being any different from any other Impy stout. The opaque blackness topped with a thin, offwhite foam also seem normal. The only deviation is the additional bitterness of the hops, which only appear to me in the taste, rather than in the smell. Its noticably drier than I'd expect, and the alcohol is well hidden. Hops dominate later in the taste. 
Its a nice change, but, to me, a minor flourish rather than a major deviation from the style. The mouthfeel is light, but chewy. Overall, very nice, and at a comfortable price point for an imperial stout."
5083,Dustin015,Storm King,4.29,"L- jet black tan head with moderate lacing

S- herbal hops up front with a sweet roasted malt and vanilla back drop

T- strong citrus and herbal hoppy flavors with some chocolate and char. Moderate to strong bitter.

T- medium body, medium carbonation.

O- well balanced very good beer. I would almost consider this a black IPA though"
5084,jonphisher,Storm King,4.13,"Pours black with a nice light brown head. Not much retention but a nice thin layer of creamy light brown persists. 

Citrus hops, dark chocolate, dark fruit, and dark roast black coffee. 

Very much similar to the nose, the hops really show a grapefruit citrus without any of the sweet. The coffee also really shows on the finish. 

Full body, moderate to low carbonation, a hint of alcohol, nice big bitterness."
5085,harrypowers,Storm King,4.1,"Pours a near black color with a small short-lived tan head and light lacing.

Smells and tastes of toasted malt and coffee. Sips are lightly bitter from start to finish.

Medium body with light carbonation. Clean dry mouthfeel.

This is a good imperial stout that probably would mellow well with some age."
5086,bullwinkle88,Stella Artois,4.2,Quickly dissipating head. Nice golden color. No real smell to speak of. Mouthfeel is prickly and refreshing. Freshness of the bottle is important for this beer. Deliciously restrained hop taste. Exceptional euro lager. Fogo De Chao features this on draft and the beer was better than the food. A marvelous experience
5087,MetalHead7734,Stella Artois,3.39,"Purchased from Costco in the ""Centuries of Brewing Tradition Heritage Collection"" variety pack. The bottle says that it was brewed in St. Louis, MO. Poured into a pilsner glass.

Look: Clear. Straw yellow. Fairly frothy, white head. Retention could be better but isnt awful.

Smell: It's honestly not really bursting with aroma. Mostly one note. Malt, with maybe a little sweetness hiding in the back. I think I'm starting to pick up a little spiciness from the hops. The nose isnt bad, it just isnt much of anything.

Taste: Much more flavorful than the nose. Light malt character and I find the hops to be ever present throughout the tasting, which adds a good balance to this beer. Dry finish

Feel: Mostly just ok. A bit less carbonation than I was expecting. The body is a bit thin and watery, but again, mostly ok.

Overall: Easy to drink and just ok. It's pisswater, what more is there to say?"
5088,Ant777uk,Stella Artois,3.91,"Reviewing again as this one is actually from Belgium.

The hops aroma when you open the bottle is simply unbelievable.

Taste doesn't quite match the aroma, still it's much much better than the Stella brewed in other countries. And all commercial beers. The taste is well balanced and sophisticated, though the mouth feel is a little thin. The flavour really magnifies the malt and keeps the hops fairly subtle. Bitterness is perfectly executed and I detect cinnamon, breadyness, ginger and dark fruits.

This really is amazing when brewed in Belgium. I am mega impressed. Compared with the Stella from England, Romania or other countries, this is so much better, especially the malt and hops. This is how beers should be, please export more and ban Heineken and similar companies from buying everyone."
5089,atowneagle,Stella Artois,2.56,Nothing to rave about. A pale lager better than bud. It should not be at $16.99 a 12 pack. I'd pass on it.
5090,ringwter,Stella Artois,3.67,"Look
Pale yellow to light gold.Very good head retention.
Smell: light malt and hop aroma
like typical International Pilsner.
Taste: Pretty good but a little restrained German Pilsner taste, nice blend of malt and hops, the Saaz coming through fairly well. Impressive to me for a Giant Corporation beer. Good move going all malt, vs the Belgian adjunct version. Funny that I've seen complaints about AB ""changing the recipe"" for the domestic version. :-)
Feel: decent medium body.
Overall: a good ""go to"" at an establishment that doesn't have an impressive selection. 
Hadn't had this in a while until recently, not having thought much of it before. Then I saw that since it is made in the US now (AB/InBev) it is an all malt beer, with Saaz hops. So, I picked some up, and had a surprise, still not expecting very much. Was pleased."
5091,DaleHolmberg,Stella Artois,3.81,My current favorite easy to find beer. Ran out with only Blue Moon in the fridge and went out to get another 12 pack. Best cheap beer I know that is found all over.
5092,ElijahLep,Stella Artois,2.7,Very slightly above average tasting beer. Has the taste of a standard lager with prominent grain notes.
5093,BeerDuff69,Stella Artois,4,"Take this as a ""casual"" review. I'm by no means a connoisseur, but this is my go-to beer in terms of common ""cheap"" brands you can find everywhere. My friends have started asking for it anytime we drink together. They seem to like it more than me. It's quickly becoming a staple for us.

Don't expect anything crazy because it is just a cheap beer found everywhere. That said, this is great for what it is and the fact you can find it everywhere helps. Bring this to social gatherings instead of Coors or Bud. People will probably enjoy it.

NOTE: For those that care, this beer is owned by Anheuser-Busch and InBev, the parent companies that own Bud Light."
5094,Robo67,Stella Artois,3.14,"Disappointing considering where it's from. However, It's better than Budweiser, Coors, Miller and many others at the same price point. 12 pack on sale at Smith's (Kroger) $9.99 which is reasonable. I'm not going to waste my time giving a full review because this beer is just slightly above average. If you like s subpar lager that's good on a hot day to quench your thirst for under a buck a beer than this is not a bad choice. But if you are buying this because it's from Belgium and you are expecting something great then you will be disappointed. I'd rate this beer no higher than a 65 out of 100. I think the 65 is actually a spot on overall score. I'd rather be seen with a long neck bottle of this in my hand than a long neck Budweiser or Miller!"
5095,LeinenkugelDrinker,Stella Artois,3.37,"Not great, not bad either, just ok. Slightly watery. Way better than that skunk-ass Heineken. Drinkable and refreshing but not something to regularly buy."
5096,Amboularozzo,Young's Double Chocolate Stout,3.34,"Bottle expired december 2023, tastes ok but very thin."
5097,BJB13,Young's Double Chocolate Stout,4.34,"12 ounce draft pour into a tulip style pint glass.

Pouring dark brown with a modest beige cap that leaves spots of lace. Aroma of chocolate malt with hints of dried fruit indicate a more tart than sweet brew. Flavor is lightly sweet chocolate malt, and tangy woody hops with minor roasted malt and coffee flavors. Smooth medium-weight mouthfeel with a very light chalkiness. Lots of subtle character with this one, seems more traditional than the American Sweet Stouts that I am used to. Very good, and light enough (feel and ABV) to be a session drinker."
5098,TurboMon_911,Young's Double Chocolate Stout,4.06,"(BBD 28 Dec 22) - Nitro version. Poured a velvety black color from a 14.9 oz. can into a standard pint glass with a creamy finger high head that receded slowly and left curtain lacing that clung to the glass as it dissipated. Aroma is earthy and grainy which is fairly standard for the style. Taste is chocolate forward but is not overly chocolaty and has hints of chicory, roasted malts & grain. Mouth is smooth, medium bodied with a clean finish and is very drinkable. Picked up for under $10 for a 4 pack and was quite pleased wit the purchase."
5099,Taproomtyler,Young's Double Chocolate Stout,4.61,Very tasty beer. Thick... not too heavy!
5100,woodchipper,Young's Double Chocolate Stout,3.58,"Poured from a 11.2oz bottle dated 28 JUL 22 to a diagonally cut tumbler at fridge temp but was slowly sipped and allowed to warm.
The body is opaque black with a short, deep tan head on top that fades but provides some quickly disappearing lacing. 
Chocolate is dominant in the smell as is the alcohol. Some dried fruit can be sensed also.
The taste brings the dried fruit out more prominently; cherrys, raisins, all “chocolate covered”. This beer bridges between the sweet and the bitter. Overall the taste is reminiscent of a box full of a fruity alcohol chocolate sampler.
Mouthfeel seems rather thin frankly, but it does leave your lips sticky.
I am not quite sure about how I feel about this beer. It was worth the experience, but will not be a repeat purchase."
5101,MikeWard,Young's Double Chocolate Stout,3.87,"16oz nitro can into a pint glass. Best before 9/19/22, so a couple weeks late on this one.

Looks superb in the glass. Jet black body, cream colored creamy head which persists throughout leaving a layer of lacing.

Creamy aroma, but smells a little off.

On tasting, not getting as much chocolate as I hoped, but a sweet creamy stout with a light roast at the end for balance.

Mouth just about reaches medium, finish roasty.

Overall, some flaws in all categories except the look."
5102,puck1225,Young's Double Chocolate Stout,4.19,"A bit surprised I had never reviewed this beer before. 

Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass. Rich dark brown color with great beige head and nice curtain lacing.smell and taste of dark chocolate and roasted malt. Clean, not overpowering taste. Rich, smooth feel. I wish I had another bottle!"
5103,weseaststream,Brown Shugga',4.08,rich with enough bite to be interesting
5104,DrOfGolf,Brown Shugga',3.58,"Local beer store had this as a single and I took a chance. First of all, I couldn't find any dates or date codes anywhere on the bottle. 

Poured cloudy brownish color with a tan head. The smell is sweet and almost of a maple syrup. The flavor is sweet and has a warmth boozie feel. A decent beer, if you like sweetness in your beers. Not my kind of beer but hey, it was a one off shot."
5105,izraelc,Brown Shugga',4,Pours a hazy amber. Thick foam. Malty aroma. Big flavors. Bitter hop body followed my syrupy malt sweetness. Light brown sugar finish. You can taste the alcohol. Complex but well balanced. An excellent strong ale.
5106,chum_husk,Brown Shugga',3.25,"12oz bottle

One of my old favorites, this is a big boozy sugary drink with a decent scent and look, and dangerous drinkability. I used to get sixers of this for $8 back in college, and many a blurry night were spent in its embrace"
5107,MadMadMike,#9,3.67,"Chilled 12 ounce bottle straight up. I haven’t seen #9 in some time, thought it was discontinued or something. Random grab at a Total Wine in Miami.,. No date stamp scared me a little.,.
Same as I remember - by no means a bad beer (no such thing, right?), has an old skool crisp pale ale vibe to it. Unpretentious and sublime. Nice to quaff one again.,."
5108,Ashes2Ashes,#9,5,"I personally love this beer, I saw alot of 3.75 rating which was a shock to me. This beer is a classic of the 90s and is still going strong for good reason. I am currently sipping one and I'm 32 years old. I remember seeing the cap with the hypnotizing swirl on it and witty sayings in the cap when I was just a kid. When I got older I started drinking these and understood why my parents loved them. I hope this beer stays around long enough for me to keep enjoying my childhood. As weird as that seems, with this beer and reading the caps it reminds me of the good times I once had when I was little growing up in the 90s. I miss that free spirit attitude everyone had and the beers taste helps me reminisce those awesome years."
5109,HardCider,#9,3.74,"This beer pours a clear amber color with a moderate white head. The aroma is sweet and yeasty. Its has a pleasant, sweet, fruity taste. A good session beer."
5110,tekstr1der,#9,3.91,Classic indeed - early gateway beer that I drank the snot out of so many times. Ton of interesting and titillating flavors combined. Would love to revisit this one if it's still brewed.
5111,Mattalica,#9,4.5,"Not heavy, refreshing, classic taste"
5112,ANIMOUL,#9,3.75,"Poured from a 12 oz can from a variety pack. Pours bronze like with decent foamy head; rapidly recedes. The ""fruit and field"" style threw me off as it tastes more like a standard lager. Meh."
5113,Peach63,#9,3.92,"Pours golden yellow with a 1/2"" white head, which lasts. Moderate lacing.

Light to medium body, moderate carbonation. Dry finish.

Pretty decent Pale Ale. Less bitterness than an IPA."
5114,paulikins86,Goose IPA,4.92,"Pours a deep, Amber colour with a compact, slightly off-white head. Sweet, fruity hop aromas preceed a tasty, hopped flavour, with a hint of bitterness on the finish. It is a terrific IPA, one of the best."
5115,MonDak_Joe1953,Goose IPA,4.18,"Tap pour at SHOW Show 2024, lower level of the Venetian Expo. Served chilled in a clear plastic glass.
Clear, dark gold colored body. One finger of creamy white head. Leaves behind a filmy ring of lacing.
Aroma of citrus fruit hops, with a base of toasted bread malts.
Taste is citrus hops, especially grapefruit, along with a solid malt base, which has the flavor of toasted bread. Gets a touch of citrus pith bitterness at the end, and this lingers. Close to pine resin also.
Medium mouthfeel. Crisp but also smooth. Brings a bite to the tongue. Very good carbonation.
Classic English IPA for style. Neat to be able to review a beer of this ilk in the midst of a very busy industry convention."
5116,Nic2022,Goose IPA,4.35,A very smooth hoppy IPA. Its bitterness is fairly tame. A pronounced grapefruit taste. Drinkable even for those who dislike IPAs. Sessionable.
5117,colts9016,Goose IPA,4.09,"1974
Name: Goose IPA
Brewery: Goose Island
Location: Chicago, IL
Style: IPA
ABV: 5.9%
Date:15 Dec 23
I am drinking Goose IPA today using a Belcher glass. Served it at 42 degrees. The pour created a creamy, three-fingered, off-white head with excellent retention. The color is deep gold with straw hues, charting around SRM 6. The beer is clear with a few carbonation bubbles. The appearance is above average for this style. 
The initial aromas are grapefruit, pine, herbal, lemon peel, and honeysuckle flowers. Nosing the glass again, I smell toasted bread and lightly toasted malts. The IPA is fresh and fragrant hops. 
The hops are grapefruit, pine resin, herbal, tangerine, and honeysuckle flowers. Sipping the beer again, I taste toasted bread and lightly toasted malts. 
The mouthfeel is astringent, and the finish is crisp and bright. The body is medium, and the carbonation is medium-plus. 
I have consumed several of these beers and have yet to check whether I rated it. I will drink this beer when nothing else is on tap except BMC; yes, I know this belongs in the BMC family. Nevertheless, it is a decent IPA to quench one's thirst. A solid IPA for buffalo wings."
5118,RPO,Goose IPA,3.89,"Light golden color, respectable amount of head
Smell of hops and citrus/fruit aroma.
Taste is very light and smooth, less pronounced hopiness and bitterness than other IPAs while still capturing the essence of IPAs. 
One of the more palatable and sessionable IPAs for non IPA drinkers."
5119,KleinSchwein,Goose IPA,3.62,"Poured from a 330ml tin.
Pours a clear straw with a half inch thick white head . The smell is hop with slight citrus and the taste is resinous with a hoppy astringency. Slightly creamy , slight alcohol , a nice medium-low bitterness and the aforementioned citrus present on the nose .
The mouthfeel is pretty decent , nicely dry which is unusual and well carbonated.
Overall, a strongly resinous and dry beer that works really well once you get a taste for it . Not bad at all."
5120,Caoimhin,Goose IPA,3.88,"Look - poured into Stange, thick head, lots of carbonation, clear golden color, light lacing 

Smell - fragrant hops

Taste - hops forward, grapefruit, bitter citrus

Feel - light, clean, refreshing

Overall - it's a good beer and reasonably priced, but a little one dimensional in its hops profile, i.e. grapefruit"
5121,kotocar,Goose IPA,4.05,"It taste like an IPA with a pale ale abv. I kinda like this. Not boozy, but full of flavor. Really earthy and a full mouth feel."
5122,papawag,Goose IPA,2.23,"Poured from a keg, and was very foamy when tapped. Once it settles in the mug, it's beautiful, with deep gold and creamy white head with lacing, that nicely dissipates. Slight dandelion aroma, and bitter dandelion taste to go with it, with a sour, peppery bite at the end. It's a miss. They should rethink it."
5123,LeinenkugelDrinker,Samuel Adams Summer Ale,4.09,Delicious beer. Purchased in the Ditch Days of Summer Variety Pack. Would definitely buy as a standalone. Great feel and flavor. Easily drinkable. Perfect for a refreshing change up.
5124,mschrei,Samuel Adams Summer Ale,3.93,"Slight cloudy, gold, mildly healthy carb. Lemony scents that follow onto the taste, with a bit of bready maltiness. Crisp, light to medium bodied - in fact, bigger bodied than I expected, pleasant alcohol assertiveness. Slightly dry finish. Better than I expected."
5125,Steve_Studnuts,Samuel Adams Summer Ale,3.2,"Let's not be verbose, yeah?

Looks fine, smells like your standard citrus wheat, tastes a little like Fruity Pebbles and is awful lite. Crisp and snappy carbonation kinda saves the mouthfeel, but I won't be reaching for seconds."
5126,cafequaid,Samuel Adams Summer Ale,1.18,"This was one of the nastiest tastings beers I’ve ever had. It looked good, but tasted like Apple cider vinegar. I guess if you’re used to drinking crappy beer then this is a good one. But, if you’re used to drinking craft beer then this rivals the cigarette ash tasting Miller Lite. Never again! This could be the last beverage on Earth and I’d opt to die of thirst."
5127,jnewhook,Samuel Adams Summer Ale,3.34,"This is a refreshing beer. It pours without much of a head, and is light looking. It has a distinct lemon flavor, like the porch rocker variety, but has more substance with the citrus and wheat flavors that accompany it. Good served cold in season."
5128,RollingRockRollingRocker,Samuel Adams Summer Ale,3.56,"This is an okay beer. Nothing fancy, and nothing extraordinary, but it is crisp, vibrant and smooth, as well as refreshing for the summertime. It has no real smell; perhaps faint lemon peel? The taste is faint lemon and citrus notes with a pinch of wheat. Overall, this one is worth a try when in season, iced cold and if you've at least never tried it before."
5129,AdmiralOzone,Samuel Adams Summer Ale,3.21,"Pours murky yellow with a white cap that fades rapidly. Minimal lacing. Aroma is faint, lemony and some grain. Flavor is also mild, citrusy and bready. Feel is medium bodied with adequate carbonation. Overall, just another drinkable beer without any outstanding qualities."
5130,SadMachine,Samuel Adams Summer Ale,3.38,"This is another backlog rating, where I know for sure I've had it and have a vague recollection of my thoughts on it. Not sure how this slipped through the cracks all these years!"
5131,ult_right,Samuel Adams Summer Ale,2.22,"Another American-style beer that is overly sweet to my taste, this one resembles a higher-end version of ""Modelo Especial"" or Miller ""High Life."" It does not have strong smells, maybe has a faint hint of citrus, but mostly has a nice easy not too intense taste with a lot of sweetness and a little more alcohol than is normal for this type of beer. I thought it was quite good for what it was, but would prefer less of a confection."
5132,lkbrdh,RuinTen Triple IPA,4.94,"Welcome to a winter IPA. This is a dark amber colored, robust, hoppy IPA. Its feels dense and well carbonated. You can taste the hops all through the beer. I would recommend this to anyone who is an IPA lover."
5133,mvanaskie13,RuinTen Triple IPA,4.3,"Poured into a goblet: color is amber, transparent, head is off white and presents 1 finger thick, dissipates to a solid top, some lacing and streaking on the glass sides. 

Smell is big, bitter, slightly biting - notes of pine, earth, citrus, juniper, some honey and syrupy notes, light caramel. 

Taste is similar with big, bitter notes of hops and alcohol - pine, earth, citrus, honey, syrup, light toast and caramel, some tonicy/herbaly/juniper notes. 

Mouthfeel is moderate carbonation, moderate sweetness, strong bitterness and slight boozy burn. 

Overall - amazed that big, big non-hazy IPAs are this hard to find - so much more nuance, flavor, and drinkability."
5134,tone77,RuinTen Triple IPA,3.82,"Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a burnt orange color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of caramel malts, pine. Taste is a pine forest, a strong malt backbone, some alcohol, significant bitterness. Feels medium/full bodied in the mouth and overall is a quality beer."
5135,Lucular,RuinTen Triple IPA,4.05,"6 oz pour on tap at Lures Bar & Grille. Pours a clear caramel color (lighter than a brown ale) with a small head. Aroma and flavor feature dank pine, grapefruit rind, caramel malt, sticky resin, and moderate booziness. Bitterness is offset by malty sweetness. Mouthfeel is full and moderately carbonated. Overall it's a nice throwback DIPA but doesn't blow me away."
5136,Bouleboubier,RuinTen Triple IPA,4.33,"(12 oz can, EJBY 08/13/22; purchased cold single at Shangy's last week... poured into a fat tulip)

L: clear, tawny-colored liquid with perhaps a faint hop haze; cratery, exploded foam sponge upon pour, collapsing quick into a thick, gummy collar... two droopy eyebrows of lace

S: semi-characteristically Stone melange of piney, outdoorsy, juice nectary hops along with a cane-sugar syrupy malty underbelly and moderately strident, tonic ethanol kick... upon further sniffage, an herbal cannabis overtone all day... supreme vibrancy if a bit indistinct in its aroma indentifiers

T: bitter-herbal, pungent hops blasting the palate roof while a jammy, citrusy hop and malt nectar permeates the palate floor with its airy, booze-shocked essences... the aftertaste is leavings of fruit and sugar sweetness with the peppery charge of biting bitterness still attacking the top, even cutting through to the sinuses... it's almost like a Malort and Cointreau-infused strong amber ale

F: resinous, silken, near cordial glory, lithe and luxurious yet punishingly pungent... its glassy, ghostly undercurrent is perhaps (along with its hot sauce fire) its most striking characteristic, as it seems to just float in the ether 

O: for all it's brashness, quintessentially Stone in its relentless (to me, fantastic) bitterness, it sports jagged facets of two-dimensional, static, obscure, muddy expressions... I'm somewhat enjoying this, but craving something more characterful, though its tactile sensations are leaving me perplexed and intrigued (1970)"
5137,highdesertdrinker,RuinTen Triple IPA,3.85,"Deep gold with decent head. It smells like alcohol and piney hops. Taste is bitter, a little hot, some malt , herbal, piney, with some fruit flavor poking through. Pretty strong and a little rough around the edges but not unbalanced and fairly easy to drink despite its profile. It reminds me of the original Hoptimum a little. Not a bad strong ale but I’ll file this in the been there done that and move on to other things, cheers!"
5138,AndyBee07040,RuinTen Triple IPA,2.89,"Disappointingly long lasting bitter after taste with no sweetness at all - unusual for double digit ABV. Reminds me a little of scotch ales with a strong, dark, almost metallic mouth feel followed by the bitterness. A strong beer that unfortunately did not get better with a second can.
I like Stone beers, but this I won't buy again"
5139,Bitterbill,RuinTen Triple IPA,3.76,"Canned April 15th enjoy by August 13th 2022.

Pours a clear gold, not much to talk aboot in the foam department. 

Smells extremely hoppy but with a big malty bite. Citrus, some pine, leans into some tropical fruit but not hugely. 

Huge Citrus bitterness and the malty sweetness is almost as huge, call it in balance, I reckon. Alcohol is there in spades but it is not hard to deal with. 
A little bit spicy, earthy, vegetal, short sips are best for me. 

Sticky, somewhat juicy mouthfeel. 

Kind of wearing on the palate but I enjoy it."
5140,ivanbrew,RuinTen Triple IPA,3.7,Definitely awesome nose and color just has a bit of too much alcohol after taste to it at the end and bitterness lasts for ever
5141,whitro17,Maximus,4.4,"Look - clear golden, creamy, fluffy white head, very good lacing 
Smell - malty, piney, resin, orange
Taste - sweet malt, pine resin, citrusy, candy orange
Feel - med body, moderate carbo, soft
Overall - This is a great brew to me. Colossal WCIPA. Very resinous with a lingering pleasant bitterness. Sweet malt, candy orange on the palate is delightful. Pairs well with Fighting the World by Manowar."

Sweetness on malt with bitterness, wild...can't figure out what the sweetness consists of yet? I'm going for sugar cookies and vanilla creme wafer cookies? The Bitter hops dominates though, and hides alcohol taste miraculously.
Mouthfeel is good carbonated dry finish
Good packaged Imperial IPA, with good Hops, I'll take over Stone Imp and Sierra's Imp."

Appearance: Pours clear, pale golden yellow with a modest froth of white foam.

Smell: Forest aroma of pine needles and resin, citrus, fruit, and dark caramel.

Taste: Flavor follows with more pine resin, lemon citrus, mixed fruit and a balancing malty caramel base. Spicy, earthy bitter hops lend a good balance.

Mouthfeel: Medium body, smooth feel and moderate carbonation.

Overall: Big, malty, hoppy and boozy all at once, remains nicely balanced and surprisingly smooth drinking."
5144,Crazy4hazy,Maximus,3.96,"Heavy lacing on glass that stayes the whole time. Beer is a dark amber in color with a pine needle , hop cone and a mild pineapple flavor. being a double colossal ipa it was very approcable and not as heavy as you would tink. If you like big ipa beers you will be trilled with this beer as its bite is mild and this is a great smooth brew. The body is simular to a red and you never can taste the 9% ABV of the beer. A very friendly IPA and I would recomend highly."
5145,FreePal88,Maximus,4,"My favorite malt liquor IPA (which is officially a style now, whether you accept it or not), easily beating Sierra Nevada's possibly overly sweet Atomic Torpedo, Voodoo Ranger's possibly overly bitter DIPA, and various other gas station mainstays. A little pungent but very balanced and smooth for what it is, with minimal alcohol heat. Subtle spiciness. Goes down pretty sweet with a little fruitiness and lots of sweet malt; finishes piney, resinous and dry."
5146,Hops_Monster,Maximus,3.3,"Poured out of a bottle into a goblet glass. Beer is 1 Month old almost to the day. Not a great head, which soon evaporates to nothing. Nose is much like the taste. Hides the alcohol well, very sweet. I personally don't like IPA this sweet, but i'm not going to nock it because of my personal taste. Although the malt is very prominent it is also very bitter and dry. It is a great beer. Just be weary about the malt if you have the same taste I do. 

solid 3.5/5"
5147,TheAwkwardBanana,Maximus,3.66,"Malty and sweet, too sweet for me honestly. Almost reminds me of a hoppy malt liquor. Little to no alcohol burn, goes down easy. Not my favorite."
5148,Grax,Maximus,4.03,"Aroma is a reliable pine and stonefrui, flavor's a great follow-up. Body's a solid, no-complications bitter pine, stonefruit, and cantaloupe. This is straightforward and strong, a good everyday drinker."
5149,MobBarley,Maximus,4.03,"Delicious and noteworthy for how well balanced is, as the brewery notes. Lovely deep golden color with a healthy, itinerant head. Pretty straightforward nose here dominated by hops. This also has powerful hop flavors that are craftily balanced with sweet bready malts. A little thin on the mouthfeel maybe. Really really tasty and gets right on top of you thanks to the well masked alcohol notes in the 9-percenter."
5150,RupeDogggg,Maximus,5,"I am in Las Vegas, bought a 19 oz can for 2.99 at the ABC store. Very good beer and I really like the sweetness and 9% alcohol. Will definitely have this again! Great beer!!

5153,MetalHead7734,Hoegaarden Original White Ale,3.66,"Purchased from Costco in the ""Centuries of Brewing Tradition Heritage Collection"" variety pack. Poured into a tulip glass.

Look: Completely cloudy and yellow. Frothy white mediam head. Ok head retention.

Smell: Citrus up front. Light and refreshing. An undercurrent of yeast and some spice buried in there.

Taste: Orange peel. Again, light and refreshing. Lemon citrus. Short finish.

Feel: Light-medium bodied with just enough carbonation to round it out.

Overall: A solid beer. It would probably be good in warm weather. Easy to drink."
5154,johnnnniee,Hoegaarden Original White Ale,3.75,"Bottle from Josh, thanks for the hookup. 
Surprised I haven't rated this before. 
Lightly hazy deep straw color with a fuzzy white head that persists.
Spicy cereal earthy with a hint of lemon and a sharp carbonic bite. Solid drinker."

5156,Lucular,Hoegaarden Original White Ale,3.86,"330 ml bottle split with my dad. Somehow I've never had this before. It strikes me as a good Belgian witbier standard-bearer (better then Blue Moon, anyhow): Spicy clove/coriander notes, wheat, biscuity malt, fruit Belgian yeasty esters, hints of banana and bubblegum. Similar to a German hefe except fruitier (citrus mainly) and lighter in color. Creamy mouthfeel, not watery. Overall, quite enjoyable."
5157,Hephaistos,Hoegaarden Original White Ale,3.73,"330 ml brown bottle, poured in a straight Vedett glass.
Opens with some fuzz, pours very vivildly but stays decently in the glass with a 3 finger white head with medium retention.
Smell is not very obvious, bit of biscuits, little orange/red fruit there.
Mouth feel is pretty good, although on the light side.
This is very accessible and easy to drink beer.
NIce yeasty tanginess, medium sweetness of the wheer and a mildly bitter herbal aftertaste of the hobs and herbs (coriandre).
The dried orange peel is not quite tasteable, but sure it blends in some where.
This style of beer is not my favourite, but surely I will drink it again, preferably on hot summer days.
A bit more chilled than the 7 degrees I drink it now. Some like some lemon in it, some think it is a waste, but drink it how you like it. Cannot imagine beerdrinkers not liking this beer.
I read below the recipee has changed a bit after AB INbev take over.
I can imagine. This beer used to be a bit more full of flavour in my youngers days.
But well, might also me be, having adjusted my taste during the years."
5158,ElijahLep,Hoegaarden Original White Ale,3.36,"Across the board, for me this is a 3-3.5 beer. Has a really nice look to it and good smell but taste doesn't do it for me. Perfectly drinkable and fairly high quality but not my type of beer."
5159,PhilipSimpson,Hoegaarden Original White Ale,3.83,"Good shit, no more words. Smoky, silky. When I drink it's as though my mouth is engulfed by them smoked wheat goodness, a bit mroe pricey than you normal beer in Malaysia, to me it's definitely worth it."
5160,JZH1000,Hoegaarden Original White Ale,3.59,"11.2oz bottle, best by May 12th 2024

On the pour 3 fingers of fine white head formed on top of a hazy golden yellow body. Retention is quite good. There is some sediment in the beer. Fine and sticky lacing is left.

Aroma is very bright, but also quite sweet. The orange aroma is right up front and almost a bit tart, followed by some sweet malts and coriander.

The flavor is much maltier than the aroma, with a touch of the coriander and some bitterness coming through in the finish. Still quite bright up front, but not nearly as much orange comes through in the flavor compared to the aroma. There is also an herbal and floral flavor, likely from hops. The sweetness becomes a bit much after a while.

The feel is at first quite refreshing, but the wheat seems to make this beer a bit heavier, both in the stomach and on the palate. The finish is quite long, and combined with the warm and almost cozy feeling from the spices, makes this beer more of an armchair/nap time beer than I ever would have expected.

Overall, if you like Witbiers try this out. AB-Inbev didn't fully ruin this one, but I've read that they did change the recipe. Good tasting, decent aroma, but a bit heavier than expected, and not in ABV. I will say the history of this beer is quite interesting."
5161,Ant777uk,Heineken Lager Beer,1.49,"It's not clear from this bottle if it is brewed in Holland or sub licenced, anyway lets give it a review.

More malty as opposed to hoppy aroma. Quite skunky. Pretty typical lager appearence, head is fairly good.

Taste is much better than the aroma. Not particulary natural or sophisticated in terms of flavour. Definitely not the kind of beer I would want to drink lots of. The hops add a light bitterness without a huge amount of flavour. Malt tastes a little heavy and not particulary organic. I much prefer German brewed Becks, Belgian brewed Stella and Italian brewed Peroni.

Many of the breweries that Heineken owns are far superior to this. It's kind of amazing how Heineken ever became so big, with such a modest product. I guess they are great business people and probably their competitors are mostly drunk.

Mouth feel is seriously simple and there isn't much happening.

For me it's rather a depressing beer considering how worldwide it is, yet how unexciting and mediocre it is."
5162,foamy-afterglow,Heineken Lager Beer,4.04,"Heineken was always one of my faves among mainstream offerings, and it still holds up well. Poured from a can to a pint glass. 

Nice colour, bit of a skunky smell but it works. Smooth and crisp with good carbonation. Something about the malty flavour that just works for me. Not a lot of hoppiness but a pleasant overall finish."
5163,Nath91,Heineken Lager Beer,2.26,"Heineken was the first ever beer I drank (and bought) legally. 18 year old me thought it was great, it was also a major sponsor of the European Champions League, so I guess through marketing I always had a fondness for it. I also enjoyed the crisp refreshing bitterness than came from it and Euro lagers. 

However, it's hard to find the Dutch brewed stuff in Australia, as it's now brewed under license here in Australia by Lion. I remember having it shortly after it started being brewed locally, and like most beers that get brewed under license, it wasn't the same. Haven't had it in a few years now, so let's see how it goes: 

Vessel: 500ml Pint can, poured into my Guinness Pint. Why not. 

Appearance: Classic Euro lager look l. Pale straw/golden. Highly carbonated, frothy white head. Does look refreshing. 

Aroma: White bread, stale vegetable smell, slightly sweet in a slightly stale manner. Not really getting that bright citrus floral hop notes. 

Taste: Sweet Pale malts, no bitterness or bright refreshing hop floral flavours like in a Peroni. Aside from the sweet malt, it's bland. Aftertaste is chemically dry, and leaves your teeth and mouth feeling dirty. 

Feel: Highly carbonated, thin and slight watery. Highly drinkable when parched. 

Overall: Disappointing. Either young adult me really was a noob when it came to beer, or the stuff brewed under license is utter crap. Either way, it's a disappointing beer. Sorry Heineken, you're not the beer I used to love.

5164,whitro17,Heineken Lager Beer,4.02,"Look - clear, straw, white bubbly head, some lacing rings left behind
Smell - skunky and spicy
Taste - skunky, spicy, fruity
Feel - medium body, well carbonated, crisp finish
Overall - On this revisit of an old classic, I bought the 22 oz Bomber bottle as it was always a bit more skunkier. Great news for me... it's still the same. I find the skunky scent to be intoxicating. The flavor hits with the same skunkiness, spicy hops and fruity sweetness. There's a nice crisp finish and the spicy hops lingers. I get it, our palates are more sophisticated now and there's a thousand better beers out there but this is still a solid classic. Pair her up with Still the Same by Bob Seger and enjoy."
5165,LeinenkugelDrinker,Heineken Lager Beer,2.29,"Such an overrated beer. Skunk-ass tasting. Overpriced. I’m not saying that I don’t occasionally enjoy one, but it’s definitely not good enough to be a daily drinker."
5166,MrOH,Heineken Lager Beer,2.79,"Clear gold with nice white head, ok retention, streaky lace
Sweet malt aroma with a little bit of sulfur, noble hops, and even though it's from a can, it still seems skunky? Maybe it's just in my head...
Blandly sweet malt flavor, mild hops, meh
Medium light bodied, could use more carbonation to make it pop.
I'd rather drink Budweiser than this."
5167,Father-of-two,Heineken Lager Beer,4.15,"Presentation: 12 ounce bottle poured into a pint glass.

Look: pale golden color. Moderate carbonation. Frothy head that evaporates slowly. 

Smell: sweet, grassy, and flowery odors primarily. Minor hops aroma. 

Taste: sour malty flavors primarily. Subtle grassy and flowery flavors. Has a distinct, funky aftertaste which I personally like. The taste is more complex and unique than I was expecting. 

Feel: light feel. Not as creamy as I expected. Almost feels more like a light beer. 

Overall: this beer is much better than its reputation would indicate. I like this beer, because it has a unique, and interesting taste. I did not notice any skunky flavors. It’s also quite drinkable. I’d highly recommend this beer to anyone looking for a flavorful lager that’s still quite drinkable."
5168,dofo777,Fresh Squeezed IPA,4.21,"A little sweet, not pretentious, fruit forward at the start and finish.

Still I will never turn down a Fresh Squeezed, OR a visit to Bend."

Aromas are flowery and candy like, very strong and pleasant.
Taste is nice but not as good as what I was expecting for the ratings I was seeing. I was expecting this to taste a lot jucier. Has some sour after notes and not as bitter as I was hoping for.
Has a thick feel in the mouth, but feels too bubbly, like too much carbonation.

A good beer for sure, but I doubt that I would buy this one again."

Mostly clear, deep gold colored body. Three fingers of off white head, which after a couple of minutes reduces to a fluffy cap. Leaves behind wide horizontal strips of lacing.
Aroma of toasted caramel malts, orange, pineapple, and pine resin.
Taste is kind of sweet and proclaims loudly the citrus and pine. Bitterness is noticeable, but not extreme. All fade slowly in the aftertaste.
Medium mouth feel. Juicy, yet drying at the end. Excellent carbonation.
Very solid IPA, which really embraces the expression of hops."

F= Slightly on the watery side, but refreshing.
O= My first taste of Boulevard Tank 7 Saison. I called it a 4 overall, but I might change to 4.25 by the end of the glass. I am satisfied and will undoubtedly purchase again."

5181,ResearchRado,Tank 7,4.44,"Dope. I’m surprised, cause I don’t usually enjoy saisons. In fact, I don’t think I’ve ever enjoyed any saison I’ve had. But this is very different than the bright, effervescent, hay scented saisons I’ve had. This tastes the way I want a Belgian triple to taste. It’s viscous, faintly sweet, still well carbonated to have great body; notes of banana and clove, plus some interesting additional notes like mint and by bubblegum."
5182,MrPhantasia,Tank 7,4.11,"Slightly tart, slightly bitter but light tasting despite the ABV. Excellent mouth feel but perhaps too carbonated as it has a tendency to erupt out of the bottle after opening regardless of how gently you've been treating it as well foaming too much regardless of how gently you pour it."
5183,JKENNEKE,Tank 7,4.25,November 2023. Hartwell. I’ve had multiple times before first time I had it was in Denver with a duck poutine so it has sentimental value to me excellent beer it has been a while since I’ve had it need to buy it more often. It is very good highly recommend.

5190,WB395,Corona Extra,3.9,"A little heavy on the comedown, but overall a solid beer, especially with the traditional lime combo."
5191,Nath91,Corona Extra,2.85,"Corona. It might just be the most famous beer in the world. Arguably the most popular. Anybody who has drunk beer, has drunk a Corona. They may not be fancy, but it does conjure up images of lying on a tropical beach somewhere, not giving a single hoot as you lie in the sun. From Albania to Azerbaijan, Zimbabwe to New Zealand, Corona's are known world over, and it might just be the worlds most popular beer. Either way, like Budweiser it's pretty much polarizing. You either like 'em, or you hate them. There's no sitting in the middle. Myself, I understand they're not the worlds most flavourful beer, but I can appreciate it for what it is. It's a pool, beach beer. Personally, I find Corona's best drunk just after a day at the beach. For some reason they just work. They are however, extremely overpriced for what they ultimately are. Unfortunately due to their popularity, you pay a premium price, for a beer that isn't premium. But that's capitalism, I suppose. 

Purchased at Glenfield Bottleshop, Sydney. Best before N/A


Appearance: Classic lager appearance. Golden straw, thin soapy white head that disapates to nothing. Highly carbonated, plenty of champagne-esque bubbles floating to the top of the beer. 

Aroma:Corn, Grain, Citrus Hop, white bread, This bottle is unskunked. Actually smells refreshing. 

Taste: Bready malt, light hope citrus, slight metallic edge to the beer. Not bitter, but a nice crispness which compliments the malty sweetness. Tastes refreshing. 

Feel: Light, refreshing, highly carbonated. A touch watery, and with the high level of carbonation its almost a little soda watery, but it's highly drinkable, sessionable, and refreshing. 

Overall: I like Coronas. There I said it. Hate me if you must, but there's a reason why they're so popular. They're simple, basic, and refreshing, and sometimes that's all you need and want. Unlike Budweiser, it's actually got flavour and character, and while it is an adjunct lager, unlike Australian lagers, it's got more refreshment value.

The only question is to lime, or not to lime. Personally, I don't mind lime, but i can drink them without. I don't think Lime is there to improve the taste, I think it's a fad that took off, and it adds a bit more of a zesty citrus element to the beer, furthering the refreshment value.

Initial taste is skunky with cerealy/malty sweetness developing right after, light in taste but not quantity."
5193,Robo67,Corona Extra,1.43,"Is this really beer? It does not taste like a beer should. I will never buy it again! I don't see what the hype is. Not worth the price at all. Enuff said. Not worth reviewing. I'd rather rate beers from Miller, Coors or Budweiser and I'm not a fan of either of them. A beer should not need a lime to mask the smell or taste but I can see why Corona does. You are not a real beer lover if you drink this garbage on a regular basis!"
5194,LeinenkugelDrinker,Corona Extra,2.37,"Tastes like a standard American lager that was brewed south of the border just so they could charge a premium. Better than Bud, not quite as good as Coors. Not bad once in a while, but overpriced as a daily drinker with a bitter taste."

5202,dkoehler42,Narwhal,4.07,"Call me Ishmael. This is Sierra Nevada's 2023 Narwhal. It's an imperial stout at 10.2%. It pours a dark brown that allows no light through it and features a brown head. Roasted malty sweetness dominates the nose. The taste does follow the aroma, but also mixes with a bitterness that seems to alternate between hops and a coffee bitterness. The mouthfeel is a little rough as it lingers. I'm glad I tried it, but I think I'm still hunting for my Moby Dick."
5203,TwilightBeerCareer,Narwhal,4.43,"I've always wanted to give this a try, finally found a single. 2023, 10.2% abv. Glad I sprung for one. Very malt forward, with hints of chocolate, espresso, and a tinge of berries. Hides the abv well. Great cold weather sipper."
5204,BruAfrica,Narwhal,4.28,"Look: Jet black pour with a rather brown head that dissipates very quickly. It has a thick, viscous appearance that reminds one of a shot of espresso.

Taste: Immediate notes of chocolate and dark malt. Hints of toffee.

Feel: A wonderful full feel with a pleasant aftertaste that makes one's mouth tingle

Overall: I would recommend this beer to anyone who is looking for a nice bitter stout that is not overpowering and can be enjoyed throughout the night without becoming cumbersome."

Taste is immediately sweet, followed by dark chocolate and good bitterness balance and a lingering, pleasant after-taste. In spite of a 10.2 ABV there is no alcohol burn or off-tastes, and it all balances and comes together. I'm sold! I'll head off to do a back-to-back with my long-time favorite Old Rasputin."
5206,brettsdailybeer,Narwhal,3.65,"A robust and heavy brew, just as a stout should be, this beer features rich flavors of dark chocolate and roasted malts. It strikes a masterful balance between sweetness and bitterness. With a potent 10% ABV—a level I personally believe all stouts should aim for—it complements the richness perfectly. This was my first time trying it, but it definitely won't be my last; it's secured a spot as one of my go-to stouts."
5207,Sabtos,Old Chub,4.32,"Way darker than I remember (perhaps due to drinking it out of the can), the appearance is very dark brown with clearer red edges under a lumpy tan had of moderate height.

Sweet caramel meets delicately smoky hickory and hints of porter roasts, finishing semi-bitter.

Though it was favorable, it's been so long that I felt the need to entirely redo my old review, as I was even happier with the current expression than I seem to have been in the past. Not only is it full of flavor, but it's unique in and of itself."
5208,startreker,Old Chub,4.75,"Poured up into my Irish pint glass. 

Appearance: Nice dark amber with a nice white foamy head that settles into a ring of foam around the glass with decent lacing.

Smell: Caramel with toffee, with nice malt forward toasted notes. Some bittersweet chocolate as well.

Body: Full bodied and thick, very satisfying on the mouthfeel.

Taste: Nice malt forward upfront, with delicious dark fruits, plums, raisins. Did I say raisin's? Sure did, and it`s delicious followed by some banana in the background, with coffee notes, with bitter sweet chocolate. Despite the 8% abv, no boozy aftertaste at all.

Overall: This is absolutely delicious!! Nice full bodied Scotch Ale loaded with flavor that the craft beer enthusiast will love!! Not a beer to be swilled down due to the the 8% abv. Savor, and enjoy!

F: A bit cola-like then lightly creamy, smooth, med-bodied w a med-length moderately drying finish, lightly chewy.
O: A malty brew w a lovely hop crispness resulting in a wee bit of a dry finish, lightly fruity, gently sweet, complex and quite delicious. EZ drinking for its 8% ABV and it is outstanding in its style. I will buy this again."
5212,DDiFran,Prima Pils,4.1,"L: straw with a slight haze. Thin white head with decent lace
S: not getting a strong smell. Some bread but this weather is affecting my sense of smell 
T: crisp. Biscuit with pine hop finish. Very tasty
F: crisp. Might be slightly too cold
O: solid Pilsner."

O: great example of the style"
5216,MrOH,Prima Pils,4.56,"Brilliantly clear light gold, dense white head, excellent retention, rings of lace
Herbal/floral/spicy hops over bready malt
Flavor follows aroma, clean bitter finish
Light bodied and appropriate carbonation
This was my after work beer for a bit, surprised I hadn't reviewed it before. One of the best made German pils in the US."
5217,Tomx,Prima Pils,4.38,"I like a pilsner with a little funk, that taste of the cellar or cave and Prima has a little funk. It also has a slight skunkyness which I am less enamored with. But the slight skunkyness is dissolved by the hoppy bite at the end. All in all one of the best pilsners I've had. and one of my favorite brews."
5218,Roguer,Prima Pils,4.16,"This is generally considered an American classic take on German pilsner, and there's a darn good reason for it.

There's a wonderful hoppy bite, but it carries the almost spicy neutrality of Noble hops, not the over the top citrus or tropical fruit of New World varietals. It's hoppy and bitter, but it's by no means an IPL. Drinks crisp and clean, with a bready, grainy deliver of the malt bill. Fairly dry finish.

It's also less complex than the best pilsners, but at the same time, it's not exactly a low volume boutique offering. Getting this kind of quality from a readily available six pack is, frankly, pretty impressive."
5219,highdesertdrinker,Prima Pils,4.02,"The second time I’ve had this so time to review. Pours a golden orange with good head. Smells a little funky, skunky, and sweet. Tastes like citrus, a little spicy, grassy, a little skunky but it’s a good skunk, and a nice bitterness from the german hops. A good pilsner and a refreshing beer, cheers!"
5220,jjamadorphd,Finestkind IPA,3.56,"It was okay, not necessarily the best IPA I've ever had, but it's still decent. I did enjoy its look and hoppy smell, even though the mouthfeel was way more carbonated than I prefer."
5221,Foyle,Finestkind IPA,4.38,"poured from 12 oz can into pint glass. Thin white head drops quickly, mild lacing, slightly hazy orange color, abundant carbonation. Aroma is pine dominate with definite malts as well. Mouthfeel is medium. Flavors: pine, orange peel, grapefruit, bread dough. The 6.9% is hardly noticeable (i.e. no strong alchohol burn). Overall: an American IPA as they once were. Good to enjoy an IPA that actually fits the style."
5222,Danmooney40,Finestkind IPA,3.92,It's good. One of the few old school IPA choices amidst all the hazy juicy brews.
5223,Captain69,Finestkind IPA,4.24,clear brite yellow with thick head great smell of hops refreshing hop taste in every sip
5224,MrOH,Finestkind IPA,4.03,"Light amber with slight chill haze, off-white head, good retention, rings of lace
Aromas of grapefruit, pine, and caramel malt
Citrus, pine, and caramel malt flavor. Slightly sweet, nice lingering bitterness
Medium bodied, slightly sticky, appropriately carbonated
A real throwback. West coast IPA brewed for folks used to the old school east coast IPA."
5225,Ggallin,Finestkind IPA,2.11,Meh.
5226,MutuelsMark,Finestkind IPA,4.19,Bronze in color with a slight head that gave way to lacing. Nose is piney. Taste is slightly smokey with a big bitter smash. Could use a little more ABV. Very well done IPA.
5227,DavetotheB,Finestkind IPA,3.76,"From a 12oz bottle dated 9/15/22 into a pint glass.

Pours a ever-so-slightly hazy yellowish orange with about one finger of white head. Meh retention. Light lacing.

Smell is interesting...light citrus, mainly oranges. Bready smell as well. Maybe mild cornbread.

Taste is a nice balance of hops and malts. Pine/resin with some bready backbone.

Slightly sticky mouthfeel. Very easy drinking. Light bitter aftertaste. Low carbonation.

Good old-school IPA that trends on the malty side."
5228,izraelc,Finestkind IPA,3,Pours a clear gold. Thin foam. Soapy aroma. Bitter hop body. A little skunky. Not really as good as it should be. Pretty one sided.
5229,Bitburger,Finestkind IPA,4.53,"It's the Thing...! Bravo!!!
Beware of the batch: 4/21/2022 4019:21 I had a 12 ounce 6-pack
It's totally over carbonated; 1/3 of EVERY can is foam whenever you open it. Bad luck this time :( 
Revised 10/25/2023: Today i got a nicer, newer 12-pack from Glouchester MA. It´s the THING!"
5230,scottishdrinker,Newcastle Brown Ale,3,"12 ounce (354 ml) bottle poured into a glass. this was the ""new version"" of NCBA btw brewed in the states for Lagunitas brewing (California & Illinois) as opposed to the UK made product which is evidently no longer available. 
the label art is still cool. The beer itself is lighter in colour since they no longer use caramel colouring. Very slight grain or barely smell. slightly sweet in taste but not horrible. feel in the mouth was typical. overall not bad. is there a better beer? sure but then it becomes splitting hairs lol.
p.s.: the beer is not listed on the lagunitas website nor could i find a date on the bottle
p.s.s.: questions were directed to heinekenusa interesting enough."
5231,MonDak_Joe1953,Newcastle Brown Ale,3.75,"12oz bottle. Brewed and bottled by Lagunitas Brewing. No dating information found.
Ruby brown colored body. One thin finger of off white/khaki colored head, and this becomes bubbly islands and a ring. Leaves a few scattered strings of lacing.
Aroma of lightly roasted malts, which seem sweet, and fruity hops.
Taste is sweet roasted malts, with a touch of caramel and nuts. Low bitterness, and the hops express a general fruity flavor. More caramel malts in the aftertaste.
Thinner than medium mouth feel. Slight minerality. Good carbonation.
A sweet malt beer that can be sessioned."

5234,LeinenkugelDrinker,Ruthless Rye IPA,4.13,"A very good brew, but not if you don’t like spice.
Look: Red with a touch of orange. Large head. 
Smell: Fresh baked bread with a hint of hops. 
Taste: As it does with the smell, the rye really comes through with the taste. The spices from the rye are very prominent and make for a really savory flavor. 
Feel: High carbonation, has a surprisingly light finish. 
Overall: This is a very bready, spice filled beer that will warm your ass up on a cold December day. I personally am quite fond of this beer, but many may find it over-powering."
5235,J-legend-K,Ruthless Rye IPA,3.81,Surprisingly good for 6 months old and nice for cold weather.
5236,The_Kriek_Freak,Ruthless Rye IPA,4.29,"I'm having this not at its freshest (4-5 months old) but it doesn't matter. It still drinks great. The rye offers a nice spiciness that compliments the other flavors. Well balanced, smooth and delicious."
5237,Bluerabbitbell,Ruthless Rye IPA,3.95,"11/27/23 12 oz bottle purchased at Caliente Pizza and Draft House in Crafton, PA

Bronze tinted deep amber look. Pepper on the nose with a bit of cigar on the taste. Definite peppery, grapefruit rind in the taste. 

Nice to find another rye IPA."
5238,whynot44,Ruthless Rye IPA,4.03,"Clear copper color with a modest but lasting off white head and a bit of lacing. 
The aroma is fresh rye bread, hints of citrus and caramel. 
The taste is slightly sweet malt, rye bread, caramel, lemon and black pepper. The finish is dry with some lingering grapefruit zest and pine, tasty and nicely balanced. 
The body is medium, moderate carbonation, very smooth and very drinkable. 
Altogether, this is a very enjoyable brew, I'm fond of rye ales and this is a very good example."
5239,InAmberChad,Ruthless Rye IPA,2.56,"Drank from a Peroni glass left in the freezer for ~40 minutes. Served cold.

Color: clear with a couple very tiny floaters; dark amber, pushing into the red territory

Head: 2 cm deep with 1-3 mm bubbles; head has a slight yellowish tinge and a nice gradient from big bubbles in the center and little bubbles on the periphery; I personally like when the top of the head separates from the lower portion with the smaller bubbles, and this beer did not dissapoint; left only left a couple rings on the glass but I was drinking it pretty quickly

Aroma: sweet, spicy, caramel when first poured; caramel became more pronounced as the beer warmed

Taste: a little bit of sweet at the beginning followed by a pure peppery flavor as it coats the tongue; strong - but not unpleasant - alcohol flavor despite only being 6.6%

Mouthfeel: crisp carbonation; coats the tongue well and sits in your mouth for awhile

Overall: I don't think I'd sit down and drink a 6-pack of these, but I'm glad Sierra Nevada brought it back. Additionally, they put it in a sampler 12-pack along with some other re-hashed one-offs. I might try drinking one room temp on a cool autumn night as it definitely reminds me of the Fall, my favorite season."
5240,Wattie83,Ruthless Rye IPA,3.94,"12oz bottle poured into a teku glass. Looks copper colored in the body with an off white head that sticks around a bit. Not a perfectly clear beer but looks still in the glass as far as carbonation. Smell is brown bread, grain, slight citrus from the hops. Taste is pretty well balanced. You get the dark bread, pepper, spiciness from the malt coupled nicely with the grapefruit, lemon, pine from the hops. These flavors seem to be well balanced with none really dominating. Feel is medium bodied with low level carbonation. Beer seems to linger a bit on the tongue. Overall, I remember this beer very differently from before. This is a very pleasant drink as it is substantial, balanced, and very good. A bit different, obviously, due to the rye. I enjoyed it."
5241,Lampro,Miller Lite,3.05,"Pale, very clear, little head, and mild aroma. Drinks like sparkling water with a slightly sweet, light malt flavor. Refreshing for a hot day or light meal."
5242,prh14thsps,Miller Lite,2.34,"My Summer with Cigar out in the back yard beer. I've drank this off and on since it came out in my college bartending days. These days it is my go to beer after mowing the lawn and as above summertime cigar smoking beer. Fall and Winter, I don't do ML, but won't bash it either.

No beer snob or quality cigar snob am I..."
5243,White_Dragon,Miller Lite,2.51,"One has to try review beers on their style/type. This is not a great Pilsner to be sure, but compared to other typical American light beers, I was shocked at how much better it is. Itt to actually has some body and flavour!!"
5244,MetalRugMan,Miller Lite,3.85,"This is my go to beer, if I need something fast, and not caring if multiple people have some. Don't know why it gets a bad rap, but a decent mass produced beer."
5245,beerboss36,Miller Lite,2.57,Great bus beer or football beer. Nothing special but an easy beer to drink with friends.
5246,ElijahLep,Miller Lite,1.64,Not completely terrible but not good by any means. Really no head at all and minimal lacing. Color is that of a typical light beer. There is little to no smell but taste is at least bearable.
5247,rrella,Miller Lite,3.9,"The beer snobs reviews of this make me giggle - not sure what you were expecting because it is what it is. It's Miller Lite, the best of the mass market light beers. Good for watching football or after mowing your lawn. I'll take high life first, but i'd never turn my nose up at one."
5248,Radome,Resin,4.27,"Poured from a 12 oz can bought in Florida. Excellent appearance for style with nice golden color, very slight haze and a beautiful pillow of head. Strong, resinous hop aroma and very hop-forward flavor, but there is a bit of sweetness from malt later in the plate and in the finish. Overall. This is everything I like about a DIPA--tons of hops and bitterness, but not shying away from the malt balance."
5249,FreePal88,Resin,4,"Really not as bitter as the marketing and reviews would have you believe. I mean it's got a bite, but it's also got a nice rich malt profile that makes it pretty smooth and easy to drink. You do feel the alcohol going down though. West coasty. Pine, resin (duh), and the slightest hint of citrus."
5250,Cdriver0414,Resin,4.35,A really nice west coast dipa. It pours a beautiful copper color. Heavy citrus with hops on the back end for the nose. Nose transfers to the palate. Easy drinking for 9.1%. If you enjoy floral citrus flavor then you must try this one
5251,GeorgianBayPackr,Resin,4.28,"This is crisp, easy mouthfeel with smooth carbonation that feels right, finishes clean and slightly dry. Straight forward hop-character. The high ABV is well masked and does not taste boozy. Very drinkable, and I will drink again."
5252,Whyteboar,Devil Dancer,4.37,"The first time I was able to try this I was on Mackinaw Island and one of the pubs had it on tap. As the Grand Hotel only had Bells Oberon (this was in late September, it was brewed in March) this was sublime. But that was before I paid attention.
Now I’ve had it fresh and aged and both are great.
The pour is a reddish tinted amber and fresh it has a dense beige head that leaves rings of lacing.
The taste, oh my. Fresh it’s a menagerie of hops that assault your mouth with no intent on letting you surrender. Piney grapefruit, herbs and grass and some flavors I still can’t describe. To top that off, it’s somehow balanced with malty flavors and rein in the bitter and provide a nice base. 
Aged the malty flavors take the lead and the hops not so much fade as morph into edging for the malt flavors so it doesn’t get too sweet. Weird the way that works, but tasty!
The feel is so good for the absolute attack of flavors; medium viscosity carries them all easily and makes this a slow sipper."
5253,imscotty,Devil Dancer,4.6,"I am enjoying one of my 2012's right now. That's right, this beer is eleven years old. I think Devil Dancer ages just fine. Don't worry, I drink them fresh too.
I think the fresh ones have a bit of an oniony flavor. Not that I mind it. As it ages the onion fades, leaving behind all that piney, caramel, tarry beauty. Finish leaves a nice bitterness on the tongue. Lucious Mouth feel. Yum!

Yes, I confess, this is one of my old-time favorites. I do not get it very often enough now, Glad I found a dusty old one in my cellar."
5254,buckthehog,Devil Dancer,4.76,Drinking this triple ipa with my boys Keith and Greg on the patio on a hot summer night in Dallas brings back great memories. So dank and so dirty. Like the pine tar from George Brett’s bat mixed with the sweat from a Neanderthal woman. Physically and psychologically one of my favorite dirty bird beers ever. I love you Founders.
5255,woemad,Devil Dancer,3.96,"12oz bottle courtesy of Whyteboar. According to the stamp on the rear label, this was bottled on January 16, 2020. Perhaps not ideal for a normal IPA, but as the same rear label makes clear, this ain't no normal IPA, as it clocks in at a fierce 12% abv!

Poured into a tulip-shaped hybrid glass (don't know what else to call it), this was a dark amber color, taking on a rubyish hue when held up to light. About an inch or so of beige colored foam was present as head, and left a decent amount of lace for such a strong beer.

Nose was of herbal grassy hops, bready malts, plus a little bit of band aid type aroma. As it warms, it gets a bit boozy.

More promising in the flavor department than in the nose. Grapefruity, piney, peppery and bready - this is a big beer that makes a big impact on the taste buds. Quite a bit of alcohol ""heat"" is present. Unsurprisingly, for a triple IPA from the midwest, there's a massive malt backbone, so for the hops to stand out as much as they do, there must have been an ungodly amount used.

Medium to full body, with a coating, resiny, almost syrupy mouthfeel. 

This is a beast! I imagine this is a beer that is very expensive to make, and get why it's not widely distributed at this point. Enjoyed this in the middle of the afternoon on a day with no commitments outside the home, and that's probably for the best! Thank you for getting this to me, Craig! It's one I've long been wanting to try!"
5256,BeerAndGasMasks,Midas Touch,3.81,"From the older bottle kept in the basement for years, it poured a clear honey yellow color with a tiny white head that slowly reduced and actually had lacing. The nose gets a dose of honey and possibly some grapes and spice. Taste follows nose, with the smooth honey hitting first, followed by the grape."
5257,blazerkor,Midas Touch,3.9,"It doesn't smell ancient.  It smells fruity and hoppy with malts in the background. Like a sweet smelling IPA.

It's bitter up front and a little spicy somehow.  Then the bready malts are really strong.  It is also fruity the entire time.

It's a medium mouthfeel with a normal amount of carbonation.  The finish tastes like a pastry, both like bread and honey.

It's pretty damn good, not as exotic as the description promises (not a hint of saffron).  It's an interesting beer. I give it a 4.7 out of 6."
5258,IPAs_for_days_13,Midas Touch,3.71,"Pours golden yellow with a thin white head. Smells of honey, white grape juice & grains; subtle boozy aroma. Taste follows the nose, this really reminds me of white grape juice that is carbonated, it is good though. Medium-bodied, moderate carbonation, smooth finish. Very interesting brew, I was happy to try it, but I don't think I would purchase again."
5259,milkshakebeersucks,Midas Touch,3.64,"Opaque, deep amber appearance with a small head and very little lacing. Sweet, honeyish aroma with varying degrees of maltiness. Flavor reintroduces the sweetness, as well as soft fruit (grapes, kiwi) and spice (particularly in the aftertaste). Vinous, medium-to-full bodied mouthfeel; long lasting finish."
5260,crazyspicychef,Midas Touch,2.61,"All I taste is saffron.
Who drinks this stuff on a regular basis?"
5261,crazyspicychef,ApriHop,2.38,"The hops drown out any apricot flavor
This stuff is horrible."
5262,noahts,ApriHop,4.71,"One of my favorite beers ever, the dark, almost caramel flavor of the apricot is a much better compliment to the IPA style that you might think. A perfectly balanced beer and a great pickup if you can find it."
5263,UncleReemus78,Franziskaner Premium Weissbier,4.59,This beer is so delicious. I gave it an overall score of 4.75. It's hard to not finish every last drop. The taste is yeasty and is much like Wiehenstephaner or Leffe Blonde. I live in a small Texas town so good beer is harder to come by. Luckily one of our liquor stores carries this brew. Fantastic!
5264,Athener56,Franziskaner Premium Weissbier,4.23,"hazy golden color with a nice head that stays for a while. nice full lacing. 
faint smell. taste is bready obviously, with flavors of banana and citrus, maybe some spice. the citrus bitterness lingers and makes it an interesing beer."
5265,acycler01,Franziskaner Premium Weissbier,4.35,"Look: A bit darker than a typical 5% American offering the German beer offers a unique taste exclusive to the Weissbier style which comes in rare form in South Texas. It offers a texture that is appealing to anyone that likes a refreshing choice of beer.

Smell: The smell offers hints of citrus in a tangy aroma that is more powerful than typical light beer offerings.

Taste: The style offered by this Munich brewerer is a staple of German beer and culture in my experience.

Feel: The feel very effervescent in it's delivery. It hits the palate with a strong feel to the side receptors of the tounge that detect a sour and tart flavor that is unique to the style.

Overall: This offering gives a strong impression of an international style rarely found, but championed in my region where German culture is celebrated. This taste Munich Brewing is a great reminder of the diversity of European beer offerings and is a staple in my selection. Bravo!"
5266,Hephaistos,Franziskaner Premium Weissbier,4.41,"500 ml can, poured in a Weissen-glass. Pours a hazy yellow golden colour, with a moderate two finger white head. Vivid carbination, small bubbles, fine foam, Biscuity smell, some sweetness, a bit of banana, little herby tanginess.
Smooth mouth feel, Very round, profound, bready tasts swith, develops sweet-sour fruity, green apple, with a tingly a bit more bitter aftertaste.

Excellent beer, great value for money."
5267,twoandeight,Franziskaner Premium Weissbier,4.87,"Sort of citrusy, sort of tangy and sour. Goes down smoothly, kind of crisp, has a nice aftertaste, kind of lingers for a while but that tartness makes for an interesting aftertaste. It isn't a heavy flavor, it is kind of light, not hearty, but still a full beer. All around good beer"
5268,TheKiboko,Franziskaner Premium Weissbier,5,"Steady head, banana and clove aroma. Slightly bitter taste. Amazing Bavarian Weißbier."
5269,bearr,Franziskaner Premium Weissbier,5,"Fantastic beer, if you like the unique taste of hefeweizen! Unfortunately, it's almost impossible to find in upstate NY. Expiration date is on bottle which is not always the case for hefeweizens."
5270,JackM4,Franziskaner Premium Weissbier,5,"This is either my #1 or #2 favorite beer, nothing bad to say about it. This is a true hefeweizen and comes in usually a little cheaper than the other popular german hefeweizens. Very thick and foamy feel to it, with a strong banana bread flavor that is perfect for enjoying during the colder months."
5271,BurtonRed,Franziskaner Premium Weissbier,4.47,"Sweet and banana with a gentle coriander finish, might be even better then weihenstephaner weissbeer. Possibly the most appetising beer to look at in a glass in the world."
5272,Taj_Mahal,Franziskaner Premium Weissbier,4.15,"Outstanding, makes you wanna offer your wife to the Bavarian gods for gracing us with this electric Weissbier. Perfect crisp tasting of the sweet brothels of 1363, the year this great vessel of glory entered the world."
5273,Lucular,Matilda,3.98,"12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours an effervescent straw yellow color with a fluffy head. Aroma and flavor feature light funk, fruity Belgian yeast esters, green apple, hint of booze, and candi sugar, atop a biscuity malt background. Solid BSPA, glad to have finally had this one."
5274,Nass,Matilda,4.21,"The pour is golden yellow with some sediment. The taste is belgian yeast, mild hops along with some sour notes from brettanomyces, along with some mild banana, pear & green apple notes. This was quite an impressive belgian ale. Cheers! A-"
5275,Captain69,Matilda,4.01,had this beer back in 2007 at 11 % seemed on the strong side . this i i just had at 7% is quite smooth great Belgium ale
5276,hbeimers,Matilda,4.12,"I love this style. It has quite a bit of fruitiness and funk, much like a good apple cider fermented with wild yeast. It reminds me of summer evenings in the countryside... Good memories, great aroma and flavor."
5277,jmdrpi,Matilda,4.08,"12 oz bottle, date code is unclear, but I think its best by 13 Jan 26

Pours golden orange color, white head. Aroma of fruity apricot, spicy clove, bready malt. Similar taste, a little tart in the finish. Thin to medium bodied, feel is a little slick."
5278,Kessel,Matilda,4.26,Big blossoming strong ale with Brett illuminating notes and Rudy-copper body. The alcohol is tame on the palate with a protracted sizzle of carbonation and back to forward bloom of malt sweetness. A jolly good pale ale hybrid.
5279,LesDewitt4beer,Matilda,4.09,"12 oz bottle drink by 11/NOV/28 into a tulip glass.
L: SRM 8 Pours lightly yeasted dark glowing caramel color with a fizzy off-white head that moves quickly to edge foam, very good carbonation bubble mix, light webbed lacing.
S: Old dried spiced fruits with clove, wet dog schtanky funk, background honey, funk becomes more prevalent with warming.
T: Lightly tart & sour fruit, berries, light apple, has an old leather halo, distant yeasty bread notes, a touch of honey, tangy citrus zest, melon rind, light resin, caramel malts in the finish. It is very gently sweet.
F: Brisk & zingy medium-bodied mouthfeel with a wide middle section and a medium-long semi-dry finish.
O: A very nice take on a style and rather enjoyable to drink. Funky aroma. Has a two-stage taste: Fruits then bready malts. Delicious tasting and has a lovely appearance as well. It is outstanding in its style."
5280,Lanoke12,Curmudgeon,4.43,This beer ages well and is one of my favorite examples on the old age style. A perfect beer for the colder months with gentle warming alcohol. Very smooth for the ABV.
5281,86sportster883,Curmudgeon,4.12,"A 2016 version, poured out of a 32oz crowler that I picked up @ SLL in Sept. 21. I’ve always enjoyed this beer fresh and cold, but leaving this beer out and sipping my way through it was great for exposing the beer’s full spectrum of aromas and flavors. This is one of the most inviting beers, if based on looks alone - a beautifully clear deep amber body is capped with a dense light tan head that clings to the glass as it slowly recedes. Note that the last of the crowler poured a bit murkier and more caramel colored than amber. The aromas are initially dominated by a mix of over ripe orchard fruits and darker, sweet, dried fruits on a raisin toast-like malt base. There is a hint of vanilla and a good dose of other oak-barrel, bourbon-like alcohol flavors to stiffly balance this beers rich base. As it warms, there’s nutty/hazelnut, caramel and toffee notes that come forward in the taste. If there’s a moment where the hops shine, it’s mid-finish where they come across as mildly herbal and lightly spicy. Medium to full-bodied with just enough carbonation and abv to keep the beer from coming across as too heavy. I haven’t had many old ales as of late, and the [English] one’s I remember were quite different. Overall, for someone who really likes big, complex, aged ales - this beer is a standout."
5282,Sigmund,Curmudgeon,3.83,"355 ml bottle, from Voldby Købmandsgaard. ABV is 9.8%. 50 IBU. Cloudy brown colour, low beige head of poor retention. Sweetish malty aroma, notes of caramel and oak, hints of dark dried fruits and alcohol. Not as sweet flavour as I feared, malty and oaky, caramel and dried figs, well balanced with the hops, a nice bitterness in the finish and aftertaste. Would buy again."
5283,JohnniEMc,Curmudgeon,4.5,"Just about as beautiful a brew can be. A request for a pint came from a tap, in a clear glass vessel. The color is a dark copper, bright, yet not translucent. The head is just barely biege, enduring and contributes to some wonderful glass lacing. The aroma is malty, almost stout-like malty. This is also good inside the mouth. It's rich, sweet, smooth and malty. But that's not all. Molasses and hops bring an earthiness that, without being bitter, enhance what would make a good ale, like a Wee Heavy Scottish Ale. The almost 10% ABV is unnoticed. That it's on the heavy side is a good thing, for any lighter, it would go down too quickly for the overall welfare of its consumer. Overall, complexly excellent."
5284,LT5,312 Urban Wheat,5,On tap at Wrigley Field in Chicago. Ahhmazingly cold and refreshing beverage on a hot day. Taste is smooth with overtones of the wheat as expected. Will buy again.
5285,Brook82,312 Urban Wheat,3.61,"Mild aroma, grains and some malty. Taste was light, crisp, with a hint of bitter finish. Feel was thin. This is a highly crushable brew, good for hot weather tailgating, or any situation where you want to avoid getting too full but want some libations. Would definitely drink again."
5286,MonDak_Joe1953,312 Urban Wheat,3.75,"12oz can. Date stamp on bottom is '02OCT23'.
Cloudy, pale gold colored body. Two fingers of white head retreat to make a cap and ring. Leaves behind scattered strings of lacing.
Aroma of wheat and floral/citrus hops.
Taste is bright and crisp. Flavors are wheat malt, some yeast, and citrus hops. Aftertaste is of short duration.
Medium mouth feel. A little drying. Good carbonation.
Easy drinking beer with an acceptable, not objectionable, taste profile."
5287,Tricolour_Absurd,312 Urban Wheat,3.8,"I personally like the redesign, hardly the reason I tried these tho, had first time at a Cubs game in the club, tried something new…
Nbsoc;
A new generation ‘Miller or Meister Brau,’ when purchased fresh this actually is a great American beer. Aroma and flavor provide some Cascade hop resin and Millennium bittering add a lot of character to this very drinkable beer! A lot of people hunt for ‘dry hopped orange juice’ beer, I personally prefer a hoppy lemon grass flavor, and that comes nicely with this beer. Head starts as a great blossom, good for this style, dissipates sort of fast but does not effect the whole experience, if anything drinking it with head into drinking it with no head is part of what adds a hazy character and some dynamic interest to the glass when drinking a deceivingly simple beer. Minimal malt presence and small noble hop spices draw this style back to a more traditional result, as well as some actually quality feeling wheat, a lot of elements add to the presence and quality of this beer. 

Definitely will drink again, and would recommend for summer gatherings, personal recommendation to anyone just trying to have a good beer without a lot of thought and at a great price point! Tell ‘em Colossal Cascade hops sent ya! Hahahahaa"
5288,WB395,312 Urban Wheat,3.41,"I think the cans look dumb, but the pour is light, and it tastes like a solid hoppy wheat beer. Overall, not bad."

Smell: lemony aroma 
Taste: light, watery, smooth, not offensive, little to null aftertaste"
5291,daliandragon,312 Urban Wheat,3.12,"I know I have had this many times and was surprised it remained unreviewed (at least by me). Flavor is kind of thin but does have some tartness and citrus notes. Unfortunately, the carbonation strangles the early flavor after which the aftertaste is watery and kind of fizzles out. Just not close to what I'm looking for in a wheat beer."
5292,Cdriver0414,312 Urban Wheat,3.5,"A light, refreshing summer offering. It doesn't quite come off as a wheat ale. A subtle lemony citrus character with a light biscuit flavor. Very crushable and good for what it is"

Appearance: Crystal clear light honey color, with a big and fluffy off white head. Spotty lacing. Pretty beer.
Smell: Fresh orange, bit of pine, slightly herbal and floral. Not a strong smelling beer, but it smells nice.
Taste: Sweet and bitter. Citrus, mainly with a bit of orange. More of a candied orange than fresh, not artificial though. Good dose of pine in there followed by a lasting bitterness. Malt is straight forward, borderline syrupy and throws some white bread flavor into the mix. Alcohol comes through loud and clear in the taste. Boozy finish.
Feel: Medium bodied, light carbonation, a little syrupy but still dry. All of that 8.2% can be felt.
Overall: A brash, boozy and enjoyable double IPA."
5296,KenjiN,2XIPA,4,"This beer has a clear orange appearance & a thick off-white head. The aroma is of citrus. The body is medium-full. Tastes are of grapefruit and orange. 

The high (8%) ABV is well-hidden."
5297,Caoimhin,2XIPA,4.35,This is a great tasting and great smelling Double IPA with a surprisingly light body. It almosts tastes like a Belgian Tripel that was hopped like an American Double IPA. It deserves the outstanding rating.
5298,DumbRunner26,2XIPA,3.77,Copper color with thick sticky head. Pine aroma. Citrus and tropical hop flavors. Balanced well with crisp mouthfeel. Overall a good representation of the style.
5299,jeffdr123,2XIPA,4.02,"On tap at Florida Taphouse. Pours a pretty copper color and maintains the lacing. This is all about the hops. Not malt. Just strongly piney hops. When I want to be reminded what IPA is about, this is a good reminder."

T- orange, citrus, strong, strong spicy malt, some arboreal bitterness, pine underbrush. It’s good.

M- oily, full bodied. 

O- good lord after some of the crap I had to drink in this mixed pack I’m glad this and the normal IPA restored my faith in ST"
5301,ReverendSoup,2XIPA,3.96,"Rich and coppery in color, 2-finger head. Great lacing; made a little heart shape in the pint glass, which is completely coincidential and your mileage may vary, but still a nice little moment for me. Smells citrusy-pineappley. The flavor is hop-forward and floral, with strong pine notes. I've noticed a lot of popular IIPAs going in a very malty direction that I am not personally a big fan of. This does not do that; up to you whether that's a good thing. Unremarkable mouthfeel. Medium bodied and very carbonated. 

I'm happy as a clam. A definite favorite for me from an otherwise ""Eh, But Drinkable"" variety pack, and very good in its own right."
5302,GrumpyGas,2XIPA,4.08,"12oz can dated ""best by 02/28/23"" poured into a pint glass shows a cloudy, gold body and boasts a proud 2"" head of lovely white fluffy bubbles that leaves a solid drape of lacing on the glass from top to bottom.

Aromas of grapefruit and pine resin match the flavor, which also includes a strong biscuit malt. A bitter residue remains behind.

Feel is full, well carbonated being just short of sharp, and not quite sticky.

Overall a classic double."
5303,Pipeknight81,Guinness Extra Stout (Original),4.94,"This beer convinced me to go with stouts. Ingredients agree with my stomach, now that I am older. Tastes and smells of dark chocolate cherries and roasted barley. Looks like a refreshing evening ahead. Mouthfeel is smooth and warm. Excellent for all kinds of weather."
5304,GuyFawkes,Guinness Extra Stout (Original),4.46,"Unknown date on the bottle (I don't know their code); drank 1/14/24 @ Roadrunner Lodge. 

Dark brown appearance. 

A rough pour yielded a huge tan head; frothy lacing remained. 

Cream, oats & mild chocolate notes in the nose. 

Creamy medium mouthfeel. 

Cream, oats & mild chocolate flavors; mild dark fruit notes emerged as this warmed. 

Easy to drink but quite flavorful. A classic for a reason."
5305,Mindcrime1000,Guinness Extra Stout (Original),3.89,"I haven't had this in years, and can't believe I've never reviewed.

Pours very dark but not opaque. Brown-black. Excellent lingering tan head. Lacing is limited but persists fairly well.

Herbal and dark fruit notes on the nose along with ashy roasted notes.

Deceptive caramel sweetness on the very tip of the tongue. Licorice and dark fruit on the finish. Coffee and roasted notes in the middle. Well balanced.

Medium bodied, mildly but pleasantly carbonated, and very drinkable. 

Somehow better than the original in nearly every way. The flavor and aroma are more distinguished."
5306,SLeffler27,Guinness Extra Stout (Original),4.37,"A 2"" light chestnut foam occupies the top of a Guinness Nonic glass, and gradually settles to 1/4"" above the flair. A filigree of lace begins to coat the glass after the first sip. The beer is black, with very dark cola highlights that are only visible when put to light.

Rich baker's chocolate and roasted malt. Some wheat bread. Strong cold black coffee as it warms.

The flavor is all roasted malt. Bitterness and sweetness are in balance. Wheat bread and walnuts give way to a lingering finish that is mild to strong. Warmth brings dark chocolate.

A creamy smooth texture with a light body. Alcohol is as expected. Carbonation is creamy.

I just might prefer this to the standard Guinness (available in my youth). Blasphemy to some perhaps, but so it is. The two are similar, and in my opinion the texture is the only significant difference."
5307,beerboss36,Guinness Extra Stout (Original),3.35,"Would have benefited from being nitrogenated, the dry stout didn’t have the full creamy feel I was expecting."
5308,brianstrong2,Crème Brûlée,4.33,"Very good, I miss this beer not being sold as not nitro. I'm sure that is still an option in Buffalo, but locally that is all I get. Texture, flavor, abv, head, all exceptional. Highly recommend.

That said, Southern Tier in my opinion is one of the few breweries in the US that I trust to pump out impeccable imperial / sweet stouts. Flavors are spot on and they don't push 15%ers that taste like whisky and chocolate syrup."
5309,cwm51662,Crème Brûlée,4.31,"Slight tan head that's gone quick. Strong vanilla/caramel smell out the bottle, almost coconut-ty. Not quite as thick a feel as I like, but close, and not sticky for all the sweet. A bit boozy, but not badly. Pretty tasty. Custard and coffee and a shot of firewater in the cup, lol!"
5310,Cm55,Crème Brûlée,3.94,"Bottle
L- dark, nearly black. Tan head is minimal
S-plenty of caramel but not much else
T-caramel, some nondescript sweetness that lacks any type of candi sugar
F-smooth and without any bite to suggest its 10abv
O-a bit one-note as it delivers on the caramel, but is a very drinkable, high abv specialty beer that matches the label."
5311,mvanaskie13,Crème Brûlée,4,"Poured into a chalice: color is black, head is light tan and presents with the nitro super fine bubbles on that initial pour. 

Smell is lightly boozy upfront, quickly overtaken by the creaminess - big lactose, really has that creamy aroma, some backing chocolate and roast. 

Taste is similar but the booziness is a backing flavor: big cream, lactose, lighter chocolate, some roast, booze. Flavor really emanates a thick cocktail like flavor. 

Mouthfeel is low nitro effervescence, strong/thick creamy sweetness, limited bitterness and even limited drying from the strength. 

Overall a big, creamy sweet brew that gives off a creamy cocktail vibe (white russian-esque)."
5312,KT3418,Crème Brûlée,3.84,"This is just sweeter than the hot cocoa one but that's really about the whole super prevalent difference. I feel like trying this one made me like them both a little less. Sweet, boozy, run of the mill. Southern Tier is super overrated as a whole to me. There's great desert beers and pastry stouts everywhere. Try something new. I will say this shits on their ipas in the since these are better at being stouts than the ipas are at being ipas. At least this is supposed to be sweet."
5313,JohnniEMc,Crème Brûlée,4.62,"Experience says that this is among the best of the desert beers. Now it's time for a critical review. Two twelve ounce cans are opened and all of the contents of one and most of the contents of the second can are fitted instead a clear glass Imperial pint mug. There's an amazing vanilla smell in the air and the beige head, preventing the entire drainage of the second can, is one of the tightest and enduring in the beer world. It adorns a beautiful black coffee colored liquid that's opaque, but reasonably bright. Behind the sharp vanilla nose hit, found is creamy sweetness, kind of like the smell gotten from an aerosol whipped cream. For its color, there's very little reference to roasted malt. There is some roasted malt bitterness in the taste. So much so that it detracts from the intended target. But, it's a mild infraction, as there's enough smooth and creamy character to carry most of the taste. Actually the stout bitterness doesn't really kick until the finish. Until then, this is an amazing liquid reminder of a pleasantly sweet desert, without the crusty covering. There's great glass lacing and a well disguised 10% ABV. Maybe not perfect, but this is one great desert beer."
5314,Sigmund,Crème Brûlée,4.05,"650 ml bottle, as Southern Tier Imperial Crème Brûlée Stout, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 10.0%. Pitch black colour, big tan head. Intense aroma of crème brûlée and vanilla from the moment you open the bottle, amazing! The smell includes caramel, of course - but also chocolate and mild coffee. The sweet flavour is first and foremost crème brûlée again, but also roasty notes of strong coffee, dark bitter chocolate and liquorice. Also some hoppy bitterness in the finish. Warming mouthfeel. An incredible dessert beer!"
5315,Saluki,Triple (White),4.74,"Poured cold in a frozen stemless wine glass. Appears cloudy but rich color and lasting rich, foamy very white head. Deliciously sweet and light, zero abv taste. Has every taste expected. Some acidity and a slight tartness. This is actually light beer. Puts every ""light"" beer to shame. 

The only complaint is the price. Not sure why it's only a 92, maybe the expectations that come with price. But I rate a lot of +92s at an 85 at best so tastes do vary. Can't wait to compare side by side to an ABT12, with the Chimay Blue when I can split them with the wife. I hogged this one all to myself."

Looks great, yellow, slight haze. Smells like a Belgian but with a fruity edge. Tastes much better when poured out. I don't really taste the orange peel, but lots of coriander and Belgian yeast flavor. A lemon tang and silky smooth yeasty goodness. Still not a fan of Goose Island's Belgian stuff. 

Baby's first Belgian"
5325,Rug,Sofie,4.07,"On tap at the Clybourne brewpub

Next stop, Goose Island. Continuing on with my Chicago beer escapade, I just had to stop at this legendary brewery for some good beers here and to go. Let’s see what their classic Saision is all about

Pours a cloudy yellow gold with 2 fingers of creamy off white head that fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing

There’s not much funk or tartness to the nose as I tend to prefer in the style, but the earthy vibe is still quite nice. I’m picking up on aromas of white pepper, lemon zest, white tea, crackery malt, tannic white wine, wildflower honey, pear skin, and earthy wheat

Likewise in taste it is more just straight earth than funk, and again still good. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting lemon zest, crackery malt, wildflower honey, white tea, peppery hops, apple skin, and light toast. The swallow brings notes of clove, bready malt, white grape, honey, peppery hops, pear skin, and a touch of vanilla

A light medium body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a crisp and sharp beer. Finishes mostly dry and refreshing

This is a nice, well rounded Saison. Nothing to seek out but good nonetheless"
5326,hbeimers,Sofie,3.98,"Fairly light with a touch of funkiness and bitterness. More bitter than I expected, but that may also be the citrus peel. Excellent aroma."
5327,German-Helles,Sofie,4.02,"This is a 12oz. bottle, poured into the Goose Island pint glass. This brew is slightly hazy, a light yellow with a slight orange tint when held up to the light. There is an abundant amount of carbonation to watch parade to the top. The half inch of fluffy white head did recede to a thin cap after several minutes.
The aroma is quite noticeable from a distance. For starters there is a sweet fruity citrus, I am leaning toward notes of orange. There is a pleasant yeast and wheat mixture happening also.
The wheat is the first thing I am picking up, a little yeast, then the orange peel. The finish is slightly bitter, a tad dry, with a bump of pepper spice.
This is an easy drinker, not heavy, a medium smooth feel."

5334,NorsemanOne,Kalamazoo Stout,3.83,"Bottled on 6.15.20

Poured at fridge temp (and will let warm up) into a tulip glass.

Pours a deep inky brown with a one finger sandy head - settles into about a 1/2 finger ultra tightly bubbled ring and a loose cap. 4

At fridge-ish temp I get some chocolate and associated sweetness and some malty body. though I do get that rich black licorice taking a whiff off the bottle. Coffee roast aromas begin to rise as it warms up. 4

Roasted coffee, dull but spicy hop presence and a hint of that black licorice offer a nice and pleasing if not unexpected flavor. 3.75

Light prickling carbo, but otherwise a lighter body for a stout with nice lingering aftertaste and smooth finish. 3.75

Overall a fairly 'sessionable' stout that is less filling than a nitro(good thing here) and was impressive stand-alone though I'd imagine pairs great with the right meal. 3.75"

5336,Mashed,Kalamazoo Stout,4.46,"First time with this stout. I love dark beer in the winter. In Wyoming that means 6 months out of the year, it seems. This is a very pleasant stout, very smooth, and sessionable. Will buy more!"
5337,Beginner2,Kalamazoo Stout,3.98,"Somehow, Kalamazoo Stout is not among the 15 I've had previously from Bell's. I've always like Bell's and probably have not written a micro-review since the announced purchase by Kirin interests a year ago. I suppose I was waiting for something to happen; but the purchase seems not to have changed Bell's. And this is a very good thing because Bell's epitomized how crafters centered in and served their communities. It actually seems to provide purpose to growth over time. Bells did and as it grew it took on new responsibilities, most recently sustainability and DEI. I hope that continues and it is why I still give Bell's very good Overall Hugs.

As for Kalamazoo... This follows the principle that if you don't try to do too much at first, it improves your chances of eventually becoming a classic. Many American stouts fell off the extreme edge, but Kalamazoo continues. And transcending the its strong licorice, my taste memory said: ""I've had this stout before, haven't I?"" I suppose I have; but it was not brewed by Bell's. It was brewed by a micro imitating and inspired by Kalamazoo. And that is what makes Kalamazoo a classic. Cheers !"
5338,Pivopijak,Wookey Jack,4.25,"draught
IBU: 65
Creamy, light tan head. Very dark chestnut, that appears almost on the border of black, for the appearance. Co-mingling of pine, grapefruit peel, with the lightest touch of medium dark roasted malt, rounding out the aroma. A touch sweet, mild grapefruit peel, pine and ample malt, for the taste."
5339,MaltsOfGlory,Wookey Jack,4.38,"12oz can, about 3 months old

Pours over two fingers of fluffy brown head into my snifter. Retention is amazing, after a solid few minutes there is still a sturdy finger of head. Lacing is perfect. Body is pitch black, even when held to the light. Looks magnificent.

Nose is very spicey, paired with a full dose of fresh baked bread. Almost a candy sweetness, but it doesn’t come across gross at all. Smells fantastic.

You get that rye in full force on the flavor, they really didn’t hold back here and I love it - rye is often hard for me to pick up. You also get some of that breadiness, the roast doesn’t come out until it gets a good while to warm. The black characteristics aren’t huge, but there is a deep maltiness that borders on molasses - it’s not gross or out of place at all. This might be a touch old, maybe that’s why some sweetness is coming out, but it’s aged quite well and has a nice smoothness once the eccentric spice passes - both being welcome.

Carbonation is medium-low. Has a somewhat heavy body that is just the slightest bit cloying - some sugars are present, but mostly subdued by the substantial spice and moderate bitterness. A lovely mouthfeel.

The drinkability is phenomenal, especially for a beer at this ABV, with this much going on. Neither the sugar, nor the spice slow me down one bit.

A lovely little beer that starts with a hoppy rye kick, and transitions to a smoother darker offering."

5342,brewerburgundy,Wookey Jack,4.25,"12oz can, wine glass, canned 12/22/22. 

Wookey resembles an imperial stout; no highlights and a magnificent cappuccino head. 

Christmas tree, peppermint patty, lavender. There are layers of chocolate behind all the pine and herbal hops. 

Malted milk balls and almost a milk stout richness, though much more bitter and hopped than you’d find with that style. The pine returns in the backend, accompanied by more floral flavors like lavender and lilac, and earthy rye. 

Creamy medium body, medium carbonation. It’s silky but balanced. 

Definitely a good Black IPA with strong and interesting hopping."
5343,TBoneJones,Wookey Jack,4.22,"About pitch black with a robust sticky deep tan head. 
Nose is a pleasant blend of hood and malt/ caramel. 
Taste is like a toasted, charry beer that happens to have hops in there, like a dark pine forest. It all works, somehow. I never seek dark IPAs but made an exception when I saw this and having heard of how good it is. Toasted rye and tingly hops, slight hints of sweetness, maybe some coffee, but this is mostly an earthy beer. 
Feels medium- full and silky smooth yet with good carbonation. 
This surprised me a bit. Not my style, but this is just a very well-made beer. Don’t expect complexity or many different discernible flavors. This is mostly about crafting balance to a simple yet flavorful conclusion. Going forward if I ever try another “black IPA”, WJ is the beer to which it’ll be measured."

Flavors of mild citrus, lemon, and bitter/spicy malt. Medium (bright) body and carbonation, substantial bitter punch and a long, roasty and hoppy finish. Outstanding."

5347,highdesertdrinker,Wookey Jack,4.4,"Pours dark brown with a thick finger of tan head. Smells like rye, hops, dark malt. The flavor is rye with good bitterness, dark malts, herbal, citrusy, it’s a tasty concoction for sure. 
This is one of the best in the Black IPA category and the rye addition makes it great IMO and I admit that rye beers are usually my jam so take that for what it’s worth and a great beer, cheers!"
5348,milkshakebeersucks,Wookey Jack,4.49,"Dark as a stout with a large tan head and very good lacing. Complex aroma. Not just the smokey, roasted malts but also licorice, dried fruit, pine and herbal hops. Taste keeps pushing the envelope as well. The resinous base pairs with the solid array of malts, especially the rye. The focus shifts with each sip and cannot be easily pigeonholed. Full bodied but not heavy. Bitter but not palate numbing. A good alcohol bite but not head spinning. Overall, it's not just about balance but how everything comes together"
5349,Whyteboar,Wookey Jack,4.29,"Got a few cans sent to me by @JonPhisher, beer nerd extraordinaire.
Poured very dark brown (black with dark brown edges) and had a *very* ambitious beige head which left sheets of lacing.
The aroma, to my damaged nose, was coffeeish with a vegetable/plant like accent. Wet hay maybe? I figured I was smelling it wrong as I generally don't smell much at all.
The taste was at first brash and harsh; all the bite of the roasted rye and copious hops were dominant. As it warmed the malts came out to play with rye bread and roasted grains, with almost a sweetness at times. The coffee and hops definitely shine the brightest, but are well supported by the other ingredients.
The feel was lively due to the carbonation, added to the bite I enjoy so much in rye beers especially, didn't distract from the sweeter aspects though. Well done.
OA, Very glad to have been able to try this, outstanding beer."
5350,puck1225,Wookey Jack,4.4,"Was so happy to hear that this beer was available again. Found that the Thistle Draftshop had it on draft and the family went with me on MLK day!

Poured from tap into a tulip glass. Beautiful black color with excellent head and curtain lacing. Smell and taste of citrus, pine and roasted malt. Lime and dark pumpernickel toast. Wonderful bitter finish and rich, full feel. Hoped they had cans, but still on the lookout!"
5351,Rwoodroffe,Vanilla Porter,3.74,"Dark almost black color, with minimal head or aroma. Strong vanilla flavor with hint of chocolate."

Aroma of roasted malts and sweet vanilla.
Taste follows and expresses sweetness from the roasted malts and the vanilla. Low bitterness. All continue in the extended aftertaste.
Thinner than medium mouth feel. Some tongue sting. Okay carbonation.
Good blend of roasted malts and vanilla. Sessionable."

5355,Jd333,Vanilla Porter,3.39,"From a mixed 15 pak of 12 oz cans poured into a chilled pint glass. Pours a deep, clear reddish brown color with a faint off white head that quickly dissipates and leaves behind no lacing. Aroma is faint vanilla like a Vanilla Coke. Taste is light and crisp with distinct sweet vanilla aftertaste. Mouthfeel is very light and not chewy as I prefer with a porter. Drinks more like a flavored brown ale or vanilla Coca-Cola. Ok, but not my style as far as porters go."
5356,NorsemanOne,Vanilla Porter,3.5,"Still going through old reviews and posting them here

Pours dark with a thin off white head

Vanilla, nutty and dark aroma

Clear and present vanilla, some dark nutty chocolatey undertones

Light, easy carbo and moderate to thin body"
5357,cardfan212,Vanilla Porter,3.4,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a nonic pint.

Look - Deep dark amber, kind of a root beer color. Gorgeous shade. Head is fluffy, billowing with life, a bright cap on the mellow body. A very attractive looking beer, could be a hair darker though.

Smell - Fairly weak. Initial note is just metallic, but some toasted grains poke through after a bit. No real vanilla or anything though.

Taste - Vanilla and milk chocolate. Doesn't even register as a beer really, more of some kind of dessert drink. It's not obnoxious or in-your-face though, it's got a bit of class and sophistication.

Feel - A bit too thin-bodied for how I typically enjoy my dark beers. Could do with a bit more sparkle and pep as well.

Overall - Eh, it's ok. For a random bottle somebody left in my fridge after a party, I can't complain. It makes for a decent weekday after-dinner sipper, just a nice little tasty treat to finish the day."
5358,BillAfromSoCal,Vanilla Porter,3.55,"no head, thin looking, unremarkable brown color, fairly thin mouthfeel, overtly sweet vanilla smell and taste. Like an alcoholic version of a vanilla flavored soft drink."
5359,Beerdrinkingman2023,Shiner Bock,4.43,Just a good refreshing beer! It's my PBR....I always have a six pack handy.
5360,RPO,Shiner Bock,3.22,"Pours dark with receding head.
Smells of tasted malts, bread, toffee.
Not smooth to drink, malt and bread flavors are present but not complex. flavors are overshadowed by a slight acidic taste. Probably wouldn't purchase again."
5361,TheBricenator,Shiner Bock,3.8,"Look: Pours an amber-brown out of the can – yes, the can – and quickly forms a silky pillow that slowly recedes, leaving a coating of lacing behind
Aroma: Freshly baked brown bread, toffee, melanoidin, toasted bread crust, and light earthy hops
Taste: Bread and melanoidin come out swinging and immediately develop depth as layers of bready goodness pile on. A little toffee rounds out the malt and earthy hops dance around in the background before closing with more bready malt
Mouthfeel: Decently full but light, clean, medium-high carbonation, and clean on the finish
Overall: I dig it. This is a classic beer and a solid Bock that is tasty and refreshing in its feel even for how much malt presence it has given the style. Nothing mind blowing but a no-nonsense malty iteration of a beer I could crush several of and a great change-of-pace sub 5% ABV lager, which are more often lighter fares"
5362,CamdenTX,Shiner Bock,4.22,"This is my favorite beer, I think it is a great beer that checks all boxes. It isn’t too bitter and isn’t too light either. It technically isn’t a true bock but it’s a true Texas beer"
5363,Brandonwright1981,Shiner Bock,4.1,One of my all time favorite beers! Just an all around good time. It’s nothing too wild or fancy. Great session beer. Cheers!
5364,WoodBrew,Shiner Bock,3.36,"I tried a pint of this beer off the tapper at the United Club at the Houston, Texas Airport. It poured a clear copper with fizzy white head that eventually dissapates and leaves no lace. The scent had german malt and grain presence. The taste was nicely balanced and easy to drink with semi sweet German bock malt base with grain presence. The mouthfeel was lighter in body with good carbonation. Overall it is a good beer."
5365,Pipeknight81,Shiner Bock,1.42,Choked one down. Tastes like soy sauce left in the heat. Over watery and smells like an old boot. I couldn't even finish the whole thing. Mouthfeel is like sandpaper.

L: copper, fairly clear. Lite tan head.
S: caramel candy, earthy and fruity.
T: malty, sweet with a fine hop bite that doesn't go too far. Some pine lingers.
F: fairly smooth drinking with a medium heavy mouthfeel. On par with Lagunitas.
O: reminds me of a Christmas ale but not as bitter. Excellent."
5368,Sigmund,Undercover Investigation Shut-down Ale,3.36,"355 ml bottle, Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 9.6%, OG 1085, IBU 66.6. Beautiful amber to copper colour, moderate off-white head. Strong aroma of fruity American hops, old marmalade, caramel and crystal malts, alcohol. The flavour is very sweet, and the alcohol is not well hidden, but soon overpowered by a massive hoppy attack. Warming mouth- and throatfeel.Maybe too much of everything, but still a guilty pleasure to drink."
5369,JohnniEMc,Undercover Investigation Shut-down Ale,3.93,"The pour from a tap into a plain pint glass brings an amber-brown fluid, closest to 16 on the SRM chart. There's a nice light biege head atop, but attention quickly shifts to the enticing malty hop aroma. There is rich body here, as evidenced by all the pretty glass lacing. The initial taste is good, malty but with some hop contributions. What kills the enjoyment is the cloyingly sweet after taste. If a honey like finish to a beer sounds good, here it is."
5370,maxpower,Undercover Investigation Shut-down Ale,4,12 oz bottle pours a deep amber in color with a beautiful creamy beige head that leaves sticky sheets of lace in the glass. Strong hop aromas of grapefruit and pine. Full bodied with a thick creamy mouthfeel. Flavors of pine and grapefruit. More of a strong IPA.
5371,JasonQKing,Undercover Investigation Shut-down Ale,4.91,"This here is the one that turned me onto American Pale Ales.

I think APA is now my favorite beer and it's thanks to Undercover Investigation Shutdown and others like it.

Doesn't look or smell too special but it tastes like a million bucks. For the high abv, you mostly just taste the hops and it is DELISH.

One of my top 5 beers I always look for and enjoy in season.

Great job, Lagunitas!"

5376,DaveMaciolek21,Head Hunter,4,"Deep gold pour, nose of grapefruit and pine. This West Coast style IPA is not shy. Nice opening citrus bite charging straight to pine resin and a nice prolonged hop bitter finish. Not surprising because there's a lot in here--5 hop varieties, 5 malt varieties. If you like your West Coasters aggressive, go Head Hunting."
5377,GregBlatz,Head Hunter,4.2,"Dark copper, A little cloudy. Head settles and stays with a bit of rockiness

Smell of pine and orange citrus. Smells like a west coast IPA.

Taste is a great balance of malt and hops. Excellent. Finished with a strong grapefruit taste that then gets backed up with a strong and welcome bitterness that remains on the tongue.

What a great old school IPA. I really like most of their beers and this one is fantastic."
5378,Bluerabbitbell,Head Hunter,4.41,"11/9/23 On tap at Caliente Pizza and Draft House in Crafton on our way home from Pittsburgh International after trip to Florida.

Aromas of apricot and pineapple. Pine for sure!

Taste is EXCELLENT! Hop bite overwhelms at first with a subtle sweet lemon peel. Complex with a very good salsa dance of hop and sweet. This is good, no this borders on great!"
5379,dano213,Head Hunter,4.23,"12oz can purchased from the fridge as a single for $2.99 plus tax. Canned on 05/15/23, so this beer is almost three months old.

Look: It has a nice orange gold color with a half finger of beige colored head. The beer is fairly clear, however it is unfiltered and there is a slight haziness / chill haze.

Smell: Lots of resinous pine and citrus (grapefruit and orange) notes. Also dried pineapple. This smells really nice, I wouldn't mind wearing fragrance that smelled like this. There's a subtle darker biscuit malt underneath all of the hops. Spicy notes along with some paint thinner. Subtle green bell pepper on the finish. More fruitiness comes through on the nose as I get into it and as the beer warms up. I ultimately get a nice, sweet cantaloupe note along with lots of orange zest.

Taste: Ooooh, this is seriously intense! They weren't kidding when they said ""aggressively hopped West-Coast IPA""! It has a bit of that enamel-stripping character that scares you at first and then ultimately endears you. I's actually really nice and while it is very bitter on the finish, it still has very clean flavors on the palate and the bitterness doesn't linger too long. It also has a nice caramel malt character to stand up to the piney, resinous hops and bitterness. So it's actually fairly balanced for such an aggressively hopped beer. Quite impressive and enjoyable.

Feel: It has a medium to medium plus mouthfeel with a bit of chewiness. Very clean.

Overall: It's really good. I kind of liken this beer to a stronger version of Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale. For such a bitter and resinous beer, it's actually quite drinkable and refreshing! This is just my second Fat Head's Brewery & Saloon beer. Good stuff.

Beer was served golden orange with a nice white head.

Nose was a nice combination of tropical and citrus fruits.

Taste was new school IPA with a not quite imperial sized malt base that displays nice flavorful hops that give notes of orange, grapefruit, mango, and some strawberry finishing with a nice piney bitterness; 6/10 on my scale.

Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied and refreshing.

Overall a delicious WCIPA, this is dangerously crushable!"
5381,MikeB_from_Macomb,Head Hunter,4.24,"I consulted the top-rated beers list for Ohio on this site before taking a road trip. This beer was #21 on the list, with thousands of reviews, so I had to find some. This is a superior IPA. Nice fresh scent when I first poured it, and lots of foam that lasted. A little hazy, dark amber color. This was hoppy, but I’ve had more intense hop taste; even so, this was delicious. I tasted grapefruit and maybe some orange or lemon. Nice mouth feel. Should have bought more. Next road trip…"
5382,Radome,Imperial Biscotti Break,4.21,"Poured from a 1 pint can that I bought in Ohio.

L - Pitch black and oily-looking going into the glass. No light can get through the glass. Head is moderately thick and foamy initially, with a medium brown color. It maintains a thin sheet and heavy lacing, all made of teeny-tiny bubbles.

S - The usual imperial stout aromas of coffee, dark chocolate and burnt grains are here. There is also a nutty note and some vanilla, especially as the beer warms. The aromas are a bit restrained, without the massive, room-filling assertiveness of some examples.

T - The flavors are also fairly conventional for the style (which is to say they are delicious)--espresso, burnt grain, molasses, light prunes and a bit of smoke. Layered onto them are some vanilla and hazelnut notes.

F - Medium to heavy body with low, creamy carbonation. Strong hops bitterness combines with the acrid roasted grains, but they are smoothed out by the heavy, sweet-ish malt. Moderate alcohol presence, especially considering the 11.5% ABV.

O - This is a very nice imperial stout, but I expected more from the description on the can. Almond and vanilla are very subtle, and I don't get any biscuit or cookie character to go along with the Biscotti name. It's just not as interesting to me as the super-high BA rating led me to expect."
5383,Perchy-McBride,Imperial Biscotti Break,3.25,"Bit of an oj Simpson for me, dark and bitter"
5384,Papercut4,Imperial Biscotti Break,4.53,"Pours out of the can a midnight black-brown, no light passes through it. A nice 2 fingers of tan head with great retention. Smells of cocoa, coffee, and roasty malts. Taste follows the nose fairly well with the coffee being the predominant flavor and the rich mouth feel is like velvet. The beer has a perfect carbonation for the style that achieves this sensation. I'm really glad I bought a four pack!"
5385,JohnniEMc,Imperial Biscotti Break,4.43,"In this rendition, it's a pint can emptied into a clear Imperial pint glass. The entire contents fit almost perfectly, as there's no extraordinary foam, just a modest and enduring dark biege head. The color of the liquid is the standard black coffee brown, no more, no less. Although the aroma is less than pungent, there is some roasted barley to be had, but the almond and vanilla additions just don't impress the nose. But, what a wonderful drink! There's the sweet malt of a great stout upfront, delivered within an incredibly rich body. Now the nuances: There's coffee, but it's not overly bitter, nor the dominating taste it can be, even in good coffee stouts. The vanilla only slightly sweetens the brew, but contributes as an extra layer, not a major taste emphasis. Almond inclusion adds body and another taste layer, without changing the overall and likely adds even more body to a brew certainly not lacking thereof. It's hard pressed to find a richer bodied stout than this one. Maybe there's not great glass lacing, but other than that, this is one of the best 10+% ABV brews out there. The alcohol is warming for sure, but not harsh and barely noticeable to taste. This is a great member of its style."
5386,Christianriveraaa,Imperial Biscotti Break,4.47,"L: Poured from a pint can into a sniffer - inky jet black pour with a huge head risen. About 3 fingers length to be exact.
S: Getting predominant aromas for vanilla, along side with molasses, slight roasty coffee, chocolate and malt aromas. Not getting much of the almond in this.
T: Getting a complexed mix of vanilla, chocolate, roasty coffee. You can taste the biscuit more so near the after taste of it all. Getting some after tastes of velvet as well. Almost similar to a chili brewed stout after taste to this.
F: Heavy bodied, alcohol hides very well. Sipper but easy to sip. The taste is so smooth and tasty, it reminds me of a stout I had that had chili peppers brewed into it.
O: This is a great stout for the price given. Honestly it's complexed but is very rich and easy to drink. This one I'll be buying again in the near future."
5387,WoodBrew,Imperial Biscotti Break,4.46,"I tried a 10oz glass of this beer off the tapper at Dry Ground Brewing as a guest tap in Paducah, Kentucky. It poured an opaque dark with thin tan head that did not leave much lace. The scent had dark chocolate and gram cracker notes. The taste was nicely balanced and easy to sip. There was dark chocolate roast malt and biscotti cookie presence. The mouthfeel was fuller in body with good carbonation. Overall it is a solid beer."
5388,harrypowers,Imperial Biscotti Break,4.35,"Pours a dark brown with a small tan cap and light lacing.

Smells of coffee, booze and toasted malt.

Tastes of sweet, toasted malt, bitter coffee and a bit of caramel and vanilla. The finish is slightly bitter and very boozy warm.

This is a powerful, well made, not overly complicated, not too cloy sipper. My first pour from the can was too cold in retrospect. This brew gets better as it warms.



Medium heavy body with light carbonation. Lush and syrupy mouthfeel."

5392,DarkLordScott,Hazelnut Brown Nectar,3.51,"Pours a golden caramel color with a vigorous one finger head. Aroma is light hazelnut and light caramelized malt. Taste is largely all caramelized malt, with hazelnut making an appearance at the very end. This is a light bodied brown and quite low in carbonation, though the head was lively. Despite all this, it is an easy brew to down."
5393,jLUNAtic88,Hazelnut Brown Nectar,4.87,Pouring this is a must. Don't just drink out of a can or bottle. Beautiful color and excellent head retention make this a beauty on your table or desk or wherever you're enjoying it. The smell of hazelnut and chocolate hit you every sip. The taste is so rich but not overpowering. Great taste of the malt and hops mix perfectly. A weird side note: This beer is still damn good even if your glass gets a little warm.
5394,Beerhug,Hazelnut Brown Nectar,4.28,"An overall lovely ale, with a slightly stronger taste of malt than I would prefer, and slightly less sweet than I feel it should be for that perfect balance. Really glad to have tried it, and would like to have it on draft someday."
5395,AphidRuin,Hazelnut Brown Nectar,2.8,Pours dark brown with caramel foam. No obvious scent. Tastes of nuts and brown sugar with quick finish. Average beer at best.
5396,mfnmbvp,Hazelnut Brown Nectar,3.53,"12 oz. can, canned 03/08/22.

Poured to a Duvel snifter.
Pours a dark ruby body, some bubbles show when held to the light. Thick finger of frothy khaki-tan head that leaves good spotty lacing.
Aroma is pleasantly toasty & nutty. Definitely invokes an authentic sense of earth / nuts / peanut / hazelnut. Slightly minerally / metallic.
Flavor profile has some muddled notes to it: earthy, herbal, bitter, with notes of dark fruits (cherries, figs, dates). Almost retains a tart cherry juice sort of quality, not sure if this is due to the age of the beer or what. Hazelnut is not exactly the main player here, if you ask me. Does retain some earthy nuttiness (peanut, hazelnut), but tastes more earthy & herbal & hoppy than anything else. Not as roasty as expected.
Feel is smooth, crisp, fairly easy-drinking. Carbonation is good.

Overall, a middle of the road offering from Rogue, in my opinion. Surprised to see that this beer has such high ratings here on the site.

Rogue Hazelnut Brown Nectar -----3.5/5"
5397,JokersAce,Hazelnut Brown Nectar,3.75,"Medium brown to dark caramel in color with a caramel beige head that briefly flashes and dissipates.

5400,akaizer,Hazelnut Brown Nectar,4.07,"From a can into a pint glass. Pour has a vibrant, slowly receding head of light biege foam that tops a fantastic amber brown body that is generally clear but with uniform particulate throughout. Scent has the pretty typical nuttiness of a brown ale with sweeter notes of toffee and hazelnut rounding it out (and almost wholly avoiding the sometimes bitter scents of a brown ale). Taste is an incredibly well balanced blend of subtle nuttiness and hazelnut with a just a smidge of bitterness peeking out. Feel is very smooth with a pleasant aftertaste that follows the taste well. An all around excellent fall beer that is very, very drinkable."

5403,Death_Adder,Summerfest,3.5,"Has a beautiful golden color, decent head, and practically no aroma. The taste is lemony and light. It is a fine and refreshing lager, but I'm more likely to grab a slightly cheaper pack of Miller High Life or PBR. Jeremy Piven probably loves this stuff.

5404,kotocar,Summerfest,3.75,It's definitely better then that pilsner (nooner). It's got a slight fruity taste in the background. It's a little bitter. I thought this would be much more refreshing. I think it's the dry bitterness of it all.

Nose is light lemon and mild yeast
Taste is a nice lemon tinged malty profile with a subtle hop dryness, not too bitter, just right.
Excellent medium body with a smooth and clean finish. Some light carbonation through the taste and a bit of thickness at the end.

Overall a very worthy beer and one that should be brewed year-round. Just a bit different from other Bohemian or Czech style to make it fun!"

Very easy to drink multiples of this on a hot day"

5411,mcm180,Summerfest,2.53,"Poured from 12oz can into my trusty Guinness glass. 

Golden yellow beer color. Nothing unique, but it’s pretty. Kinda like a newscaster is pretty in a generic way. 

Smells floral, lemony, and round. Full. Not quite lemon Pledge but full. Even for my poor smelling. 

Taste: too spicy-hoppy to be refreshing. The can lied to me. Tastes like it’s trying hard to be a proper snobby craft beer instead of a drinkable lager. Or like Sierra Nevada just couldn’t help themselves and made another IPA. 

Feel: a little thick and syrupy. Decent carbonation, but the overly heavy feel kinda goes with the hifalutin beer thing. 

Overall: not for me."

Look - Pours a thin and fizzy off-white head that dies down pretty quickly. Crystal clear, golden yellow appearance with tons of streaming bubbles.
Smell - The scent is mostly floral hops and lager yeast. Also picking up some woodiness and slight zesty lemon qualities.
Taste - The taste follows the nose with the floral hops and woodiness dominating the most. The slight bitterness seems to be cancelled by a lemon sweetness in the aftertaste.
Feel - Medium bodied with a semi-crisp mouthfeel and finishes dry.
Overall - Nice hop characteristics for an easy drinking lager."

Overall - So intrigued by all the pics posted and solid reviews of this lager that I had to pick one up and see for myself what all the hype was about. Pour was an old school pale straw and the scent brought back memories of the lagers I grew up on. Bready malts, floral and a hint of menthol on the nose. The taste is bready, grassy and fruity but enhanced by the lemon zest and a bit of spice. Good brew that is a refreshing summer lager best enjoyed while listening to Du Hast by Rammstein."
5415,Tolianych_Pivomnabuhanych,Pilsner Urquell,5,"I can't believe some reviewers rate THE ORIGINAL PILSNER below 5 points. This is the ONE and ONLY Pilsner that started the trend.

Everything about this brew is perfect. This is HEAVENLY AMBROSIA!!!

Everyone else, go learn. German and other international ""pilsner-style"" brews are lame knockoffs."
5416,Hephaistos,Pilsner Urquell,3.17,"The legend has this started the pilsner style of beer. In my younger days I did not know better if this was typical beer.

Pretty darkbrown 330 ml bottle, 4,4 % abv. poored in a straight Palm glass at around 5 degrees celcius.
Opens with a bit of smoke. Medium carbonation, gettinf flat soon, but low on the foam. 1 finger white head, poor retention. Clear yellow colour, a bit on the pale sight.
Smell, malts, but of humid cellar smell.
Taste: first you got the malts, they are not very pleasant, than slight notes of honey-like sweetness take over, before the very bitter hops kick in.
Mouthfeel not unpleasant and at 4,4% this is of course very drinkable. 
If you like hoppy-bitterness, this is a very good pilsner for you."
5417,MaltsOfGlory,Pilsner Urquell,3.97,"16oz can

Pours a finger of white head into my Willi. Retention is poor and the head fades within a minute. Lacing is ok. Body is golden orange, crystal clear, with minimal nucleation. Looks alright.

Nose is very bready and malty. Definitely some spicy noble hops hiding in here. It seems somewhat balanced, but definitely tilts towards the maltier side of the style. Smells nice.

Flavor definitely leans bready and malty as well, though as with the nose there is a significant hop presence that quickly comes in - floral, tiny bit of spice. A touch maltier than I would like for the style, but the hops are distinguished, and they add a somewhat unique touch. All in all the taste is good.

Carbonation is on the higher side. Somewhat light bodied, but the carbonation has it drinking a little fuller than that. Despite being malty, this is incredibly clean and attenuated, though unfortunately not very crisp. Bitterness is somewhat low. Altogether the mouthfeel is nice enough.

Drinkability is pretty good.

Not exactly what I want out of a Pilsner, but it’s very flavorful and pretty tasty."
5418,nwalke16,Pilsner Urquell,3.01,"The taste itself is not my cup of tea, but it is a classic Czech beer that is easy drinking. It's just okay though and definitely not the best beer that I've had."
5419,foamy-afterglow,Pilsner Urquell,4.04,"The world's first pilsner dates back to 1842 from the town of Pilsen in the Czech Republic. 

Lovely scent with some citrus. Crisp flavour with a little complexity. Strong hoppy bitterness and lengthy finish."
5420,DaleHolmberg,Pilsner Urquell,3.42,"Great tasting bright beer. Not easy to find so I get some when I can. Clean, fresh and tasty."
5421,LeinenkugelDrinker,Pilsner Urquell,3.95,"It’s the original Pilsner, and truly is great. Strong bitter flavor in a light and highly carbonated body. Relatively cheap, available at most stores and gas stations. Cool cap design. Down the hatch!!"
5422,MissouriMule,Pilsner Urquell,4.7,"Pours light straw with a tall white head that lingers.

This beer is moderately aromatic. The small is sweet malt with spicy floral overtones. 

The balance of the flavors matches the aroma. There is sweet maltiness, but the bitterness of the hops takes over quickly and remains in the aftertaste. 

The nose and the taste are excellent. The only letdown is the thin mouthfeel. The feel is not enough of a deficit to put me off this beer, though.

This is a solid classic Pilsner. It will not revolutionize your thinking about beer, but it will take you back to basics in a good way."
5423,wmeckley44,Pilsner Urquell,4.46,"It's just good. Cheap, reliable, light and refreshing. Nothing else to say. It's almost macro lager price while being insanely flavorful."
5424,AleManDan,Samuel Adams Rebel IPA,3.33,"This is a tame IPA, but I like it well enough. I'd be happy to drink it a party at which I didn't pay for it. :) Haha! That's not a bash, it's just a very inoffensive and NOT rebellious form of the style that has a more pronounced malt profile and a balanced and tame hope bite.

Sure, if you are not an IPA drinker you may notice what might be perceived as a strong hop presence, giving it the typical citrus and pine notes. It does pour a golden color with a frothy head, creating an inviting appearance so there's also that...put it in a glass and church it up baby!! 

The standout features of this beer is its balance. Despite the high hop content, it manages to maintain a smooth and drinkable flavor that I think makes it very middling in the true sense of the word, but not necessarily in a bad way. 

The bitterness is well-matched with a malty sweetness, creating a harmonious flavor profile. This beer is perfect for those who enjoy a strong and hoppy IPA without overpowering the senses

A brewery that made it's name NOT making hoppy beers has made one that I think is aligned with their overall portfolio. I can appreciate this as their IPA, not THE prototypical American or WC IPA, this is a Sam Adams IPA and it's good!"
5425,BucBasil,Samuel Adams Rebel IPA,3.82,"This beer is way more balanced than your typical IPA. The first note was more malt than hops, which was interesting. Bread and toasted malt. Then the hops. Floral, slightly earthy, a bitnof pine. Balance is the big word here. Super drinkable. A go-to beer for sure."
5426,davidward,Samuel Adams Rebel IPA,4,A lighter IPA that I think works well as a tasty refresher.
5427,JohnniEMc,Samuel Adams Rebel IPA,3.63,"Poured a couple of brown 12 oz. bottles into a singular clear glass liter mug for observation. It's a light bright copper color, with emphasis on light. Rather translucent more than colorful, maybe the head and lacing will compensate. No, there's little of either there. The lacing outperforms, but not by much. It's not aromatic, neither. OK, now for the taste, the big category. Unfortunately, nothing to rave about here. It's pretty good; well balanced between a noticeable malt backbone, which is more earthy than sweet (good) and a hoppy finish. The body is a little thin and the hops aren't bitter enough, but they're there. If ever there was an IPA intended to be mass produced to offend the least number of drinkers, this is it. Not at all rebellious, it conforms to the basic norms of a mainstream beer with a hint of a style above the standard American lager. Likely the best choice at national chain restaurants."
5428,feloniousmonk,Samuel Adams Rebel IPA,3.87,"12/11/14:
Appearance: clear, bright golden hue, long-lasting, bone white head, looking good.

Aroma: Fresh and lively hop aromatics, screaming with citrus and tropical fruits, bristling with pine and grass. Green as it gets.

Taste: Brisk hop bite at the front, soft and mellow from there on out. Light bodied, but with a long, bitter hop finish. Exquisite drinkability, but for hop-heads only. Bitter hop resins lay long on the palate, providing more than sufficient refreshment for those of us who crave the alpha acids.

A very nice rendition of this popular style, but it's not just not landing on the top tier, I'm afraid. A few steps short.

Wait. I just noticed something. The box reads: ""Enjoy before Dec. 2014."" No specific date given. This was purchased in early December 2014. I always see a lot of these cases at the store I bought it at, I'm guessing it's not that popular, for whatever reason. Maybe if I'd bought it earlier, it would taste fresher, and I'd see higher up on that tier…maybe...

What's the paper on the bottle say? ""Rebel IPA is brewed with 5 varieties of West Coast hops: Cascade, Simcoe, Centennial, Chinook & Amarillo, It's everything we love about West Coast-style IPAs, Big citrus & grapefruit flavors with subtle pine notes for a flavorful, refreshing brew."""

5430,Cdriver0414,Festina Pêche,3.83,"It is pretty cool to see tiny peach chunks floating around. The smell is not as good as it could be. It's a subtle peach smell slightly overpowered by the sour. The taste of this beer is excellent though. If you love peach with a sour afternoon, this is the beer for you. This beer is so refreshing on a hot day and so crushable. The low abv and flavor make this an excellent light choice for the summer."
5431,HardCider,Festina Pêche,3.54,"This beer pours a cloudy apricot color with a moderate white head. There is a strong, pleasant smell of pineapple. The taste is bitter and tangy. The most notable flavor is lemon, but its overpowered by an artificial sweetener."

5439,Sabtos,Hop Nosh IPA,4.03,"Based on my fairly unkind perception of Hop Nosh's expression back in 2015, I find it absolutely necessary to delete my old review and reevaluate now, as that opinion just does not apply anymore, largely in terms of my own palate, preferences and overall experiential evolution.

Lightly foggy orange-amber--just about as hazy as Hazy Nosh, ironically enough--with a moderately short off-white head leaving substantial but fluid lacing that falls back down to the surface in slo-mo.

A solid West Coast IPA with plenty of citrus and pine working in concert, it's quite a bit more bitter and dank than their hazy, obviously, but without all that limey juiciness, instead exhibiting some catty hints in the exhale. However, it's quite clean up front, and stunningly reminds me of the sort of prickly resins often found in Fat Head's stellar IPA program, although paired with a lesser hint of dampening graham.

The moderate body has a gently expanding carbonation and finishes just dry."
5440,The_Beer_Guru,Hop Nosh IPA,4.25,Great go-to west coast ipa
5441,CBlack85,Hop Nosh IPA,4.15,"Poured from a 12 oz can into a Sixpoint can glass

the beer pours a murky light copper color with a ton of floaties. Kind of surprised after reading so many reviews describing the color as a clear copper color... about three fingers worth of rocky white head with substantial lacing.

Lots of citrus fruits in the aroma, as well as some pineapple, mango, and papaya. Mildly bready and earthy malts balance out the hopiness. 

Like the aroma the flavor is orange, papaya, mango, with a nice bready, toasty malt character. Great balance. Medium bodied and slick on the tounge. A bit heavier than most IPA's, definitely a well balanced beer more in line with the east coast IPA style, but with the big citrusy hop punch of a west coast IPA

Overall, a very good beer that I would would be happy to see on tap or on the shelf."
5442,maxpower,Hop Nosh IPA,3.91,"12 oz can pours a clear copper color with a average off white head of large bubbles, leaves some lacing in my glass. Fresh grapefruit and pine aromas, hoppy citrus and pine flavors. Medium bodied with a soft and creamy mouthfeel, finishes dry."
5443,travis1108,1554,3.64,"Wow. This is smooth. I prefer stouts and porters I read that this drinks like one. I was doubtful, but I decided to give it a try. Pleasantly surprised. 
Great mouth feel. Dry with a hint of chocolate. Kinda creamy even but not in a sticky sweet way. Not impressed with the smell though. I can't quite place it but I suspect it is the licorice root"
5444,solok,1554,3.69,"Dark, almost black. Short-lived dark tinged head. Porter flavor. Miso soup aftertaste. Smell of porter, coffee beans. Feels nice, with decent effervescence."
5445,JohnniEMc,1554,4.09,"Consider it a wonderful set of pours, as two twelve ounce cans have been emptied into a clear glass liter mug. The color of the brew is a dark and malty mahogany one; dark brown, with reddish tint. It's bright, but quite opaque. There's a substantial biege head that seems to be enduring. There's more malt to smell than anything else, then yeast and maybe some hops and alcohol. To drink, this is a malty one. Remarkably, it's rich and smooth, yet light across the palate. This isn't a hopfest, nor is it laden with all the yeast and ester distractions some find appetizing in a Belgian style brew. Nor does the roasted malt, or barley, if that's the case, bring a bitter aspect. Continuing with what it's not, the yeast, alcohol and hops barely make their presence known. It maybe malty, but it's not overly sweet and the malt does allow traces of other tastes to come through. No, it's not the most interesting brew to drink and it certainly can disappoint people seeking a hoppy bite, or the typical Belgian brew characteristics. But, it's very drinkable and outstanding in two categories. It's beautiful in the glass. The color and head are basically flawless and the copious stratified glass lacing is among the best. As a brew relying mostly on malt, this is particularly good for the mouthfeel category, as there's also no hoppy bite, nor alcohol burn at the finish. This is a very comfortable beer to drink."
5446,Stooven,1554,3.73,"Been running through a lot of the larger-distribution domestic crafts I've never reviewed. This is a decent fall beer; probably the 2nd best offering in the mixed pack with Trippel, X IPA and Fat Tire. Don't serve it too cold, because it thins out."

Appearance: Dark brown with a massive light tan head that lasted long and left abundant lacing.

Nose: Rich roast, bread.

Mouthfeel: Light.

Attack: Sort of follows the nose, adding bitter roast a bit too quickly; I was hoping for a little more depth in the flavor.

Finish: Continues and resolves the bitterness with some hops.

Overall: The look and the nose set me up for higher expectations. It’s drinkable, but won’t go down as my favorite."

Strong and unpleasant aroma of stale orange marmalade and rotting fruits and vegetables. Distinctly hoppy and resinous flavour, better than the aroma, not too sweet, with a solid bitterness in the finish."

It’s a little too bland for my taste now. Still, a good solid IPA."

5457,ATL6245,IPA,4.32,"Appearance: Clear amber, fluffy white head with good retention.

Aroma: Citrus and toasted, bready malt.

Flavor: Citrus, toast and bread. Moderately sweet. Moderate bitterness.

Mouthfeel: Drying, moderate carbonation, medium length finish.

Overall: Another iconic, old school IPA. Pours a clear amber color producing a nice fluffy white head with good retention. The Cascade and Cluster Hops provide citrus aromas of grapefruit and oranges that distinguish the nose. You also get some toasty bread hints from the lightly roasted malts. Tastes include citrus notes combined with the sweet malt that you would expect from a beer of amber color. Bitterness is quite restrained; however, the sweetness is as well, giving it a nice balance between the two. It finishes on the dry side with a medium aftertaste. Well crafted, classically balanced IPA."
5458,BubbleBobble,IPA,3.57,"Pours a slightly cloudy deep golden orange, 1.5"" soapy head with good retention and lacing. Nose is malt and roasted barley with a nice background note of pine and earthy spice. Taste is also malt forward, though there's enough hop presence to keep things balance. Would like a bit more bright, spicy hop, but this still satisfies. Mouthfeel is moderate with light carbonation."

What a damn shame because very pretty to look at the smell follows the description on the can perfectly as does the taste when it FIRST hits your mouth and then....ugh it all falls apart. What a disappointment. Especially considering it came highly recommended from someone who always gives me good suggestions. I only got one can. Part of me wants to buy another just by chance that this one was off or aybe my taste buds were but...."

5464,DarkPassport,Xocoveza,2.86,"Appearance: On draft into stemmed tulip glass. Very dark brown with thick, lofty dirty brown head. The foam stuck around for a long time and left plenty of lacing.

Aroma: Overpowering cinnamon with some bready malts. Reminiscent of Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal with milk.

Taste: Spicy cinnamon. Dark malt. Alcohol. Maybe a touch of chocolate.

Feel: Thin and watery with medium carbonation.

Overall: The light feel of the beer didn't carry the weight of the flavor. Plus the spice profile was over the top and the alcohol feel was stronger than expexted for the ABV. There is a lot of potential here if they were to thicken it up and balance the malt flavors with the spices."
5465,dkoehler42,Xocoveza,4.05,"It's a dark brown in the glass, and it doesn't allow light through. There's a brown head and aroma of roasted malt and sweetness, with maybe a hint of cinnamon.

The pepper spice does carry through the entire sip while the sweetness departs earlier but the whole thing finishes cleanly."
5466,AccipiterofBeer,Xocoveza,4.07,"Pours a jet black with a tan head with evident carbonation. Wintry spices and cacao on the nose. Very chocolately taste when it is cold, but the spices really come out and overpower that chocolately flavor when the beer warms. This is a stout that you want refrigerated. Lactose. Cinnamon. Coffee. A hint of spicy pepper. The mouthfeel is on the thinner end. Overall, this is a good stout. One you should try if stout is your thing."
5467,gromme,Xocoveza,3.19,"Very overrated beer. 

Despite long list of ingredients, its taste lacks complexity. Spices predominate. Cocoa and vanilla are not really identifiable. Slightly metallic aftertaste. 

Mouthfeel misses the mark for an imperial stout. It is thin and carbonated. 

Overall, simply fails to deliver the rich, decadent drinking experience suggested by its packaging, or to justify its premium price. Has more in common with middle-of-the-road porters than other imperial stouts in this price bracket."
5468,mwilbur,Xocoveza,3.99,"Poured from 12 oz can into snifter.
A: Pours a dark brown hue with 2 inch frothy mocha head with good retention, eventually settling to a thin skim with nice lacing on the glass.

T: Roast malt with bitter chocolate and coffee hits first, followed by cinnamon, vanilla, almond, and just a touch of spicy pepper.
M: Light medium body. Very bitter with mild dark sweetness and a touch of spicy heat. Lingers nicely on the palate.
D: A nice example of style. Lovely holiday brew!"
5469,steved5500,Xocoveza,2.88,"Totally disappointed. In a few words this is a thin gruel. Nothing as before. A blind taste testing would not even give me the faintest hint of Mexican cocoa. Back to my go-to of norwell, Old Rasputin and anything else that provides substance."
5470,wiggibow,Xocoveza,3.31,"Not sure if this 2023 batch is different, or I'm just misremembering this beer. I recall being absolutely blown away by it back around 2017/18 or so, enough that I would have considered it an all time favorite. Easy 5/5. I quit drinking for some years and haven't had one since, so I eagerly snatched up a sixer the second I saw the new release at my local store.

This tastes nothing like I remember it. I recall the espresso flavor absolutely slapping me in the face, the spices being well balanced but easily discernable, and a textbook thick, creamy, full-bodied imperial stout mouth-feel.

What I'm getting from this 2023 release seems practically the opposite; I can hardly tell there are any spices in there, I taste less of a coffee flavor in here than in plenty of other non-coffee stouts, and the body is rather thin - much closer to a standard stout than an imperial.

It's still a pretty tasty brew, I definitely don't dislike it, but it is a catastrophic disappointment compared to my glowing memory of this beer, so it is very difficult to be objective here. Either my memory is playing tricks on me, my pallete has changed, or they've altered the recipie in some way. Either way; my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined."
5471,tekstr1der,Raison D'Être,3.32,"This was deeply appealing by description. Not sure if it was the yeast or (maybe) bad bottle, but the stuff was kind of bitter and frankly a bit nasty. Scoring more objectively with benefit of the doubt."

The taste is slightly sugary, with raisin flavor before an alcohol hot, barely bitter finish. Not real complex and scary close to cherry cough syrup. The mouthfeel is medium plus bodied with below average carbonation and anundry finish. Overall, subpar. I got a stupid deal on this crowler ($5) and I imagine that this keg had been on tap for quite a while with the restrictions on shopping. I would still try this from a dated bottle or a bar that does a brisk business. Numerically rated close to the existing average for fairness."

Aroma is strong - plum, dark fruits, raisins, fig and caramely malts. A little bit of alcohol seeps through, but just barely. Flavor profile carries the same profile forward, hitting notes of plum, dark fruits, raisins, fig and toffee with caramely, nutty malts underneath. Alcohol is a little more apparent here. Mouth feel is full with a medium-thick consistency that firms up to 'thick' when the glass has been warmed slightly. Light graininess adds a little texture to each sip. Overall, heavy and full with strong raisins and dark fruit qualities.

5476,JZH1000,Titan IPA,3.77,"Had on tap at boondocks fun center Thornton

On arrival there is a very light haze in a deep gold body dome lacing forms.

Aroma is more of an old school WCIPA, with a touch of dank edd, and an almost toasty malt in the very back. Not as intense as expected. Slight bitter herbal hops that are almost but not quite piney.

Taste follows the aroma with a decent bitterness right up front, that carries an herbal, dank, flavor that fades slightly to a mellow pine resin, and toasted malt. Super clean and crisp. 

The feel is super smooth, due to a dryness taming the full malty body. Finish is longer and is very balanced with a slight warming sensation. Very good 7%+ IPA in this category.

Overall this is pretty good. Nothing crazy out of the ordinary, but a solid WC style IPA with a reasonably unique hop profile."

Not overly powerful. Brewer's notes describe this well."

Smell is slight honey, some resinous pine, and a vague fruity aroma. Light biscuity malt , and a background yeasty smell. 

Taste is pine and a bit of citrus rind. 

Feel is medium, lightly sticky, with moderate, very fine, sharp carbonation. 

Overall, not bad. Classic, old-school-type resinous DIPA. Don't get much of the ""Belgian"", except in the aroma. Nevertheless, it's a good, solid IPA, that's a nice break from NEIPAs ."
5482,Holistervildercamp,Raging Bitch,4.89,"She has lost some of her Belgian quality over the years. Miss her murky waters. The initial Belgian yeast scent fades quickly now. If this hadn't come so far as MD, and if it were readily available, I might rate it higher. Still has a nice label, but it doesn't advertise itself as Belgian style any longer. As it probably shouldn't. Why fuck with a good thing flying dog?"
5483,freystout17,Raging Bitch,2.67,"Would not buy it again. Stringent lingering aftertaste that takes all of the fun out. Belgian ? Yes. IPA ? If so, I don't know where...?? This beer has no resemblance to a typical IPA. Think Belgian with a ferocious bitter and affronting aftertaste.
GLTA. I won't go back to this one."
5484,gogglesnteeth,Raging Bitch,4,Good pre-season football beer
5485,hman43,Raging Bitch,3.76,"Look: It pours amber with a bit of cloudiness. It has an off white head with excellent head retention. 

Smell: It has a strong aroma of apricots with caramel with some honey and citrus. 

Taste: It has apricot flavor with caramel and honey. There are some light cherry elements with other citrus notes in the background. There are very light barnyard elements. 

Feel: It has a medium full body with moderate bitterness. 

Overall, it drinks more link a thick west coast IPA than a Belgian to me, but there are nice worthwhile flavors."
5486,Franziskaner,Hercules Double IPA,4.07,"Light gold in color with with a fingernail of off white. Light, soapy lacing on the glass. The aroma is of earthy hops , light malt, and alcohol. I’m tasting lots of earthy to lime hops with plenty of booze. The mouth is dry and warm with alcohol."
5487,beergoot,Hercules Double IPA,4.17,"Clear, golden hued body; dense, slow rising carbonation; thick, white head, long lasting, semi-creamy texture. Initial scent of floral and tropical fruit notes; mild spicy zestiness; very faint earthy maltiness. Very mild cereal grain flavor carrying a zesty, spicy hop flavor; white pepper, sage and turmeric; moderate bitterness; very quiet alcohol presence. Medium-heavy mouthfeel; smooth and lightly velvety; bold alcohol warmth presence; semi-dry at the finish.

I know I've had this beer before, likely before my BeerAdvocate days. Regardless, this is my first rating and review of this beer. It is a solid, easy drinking imperial India pale ale. Simple yet alluring.

Pouring temperature: 46 °F; canning info: 5/11/23
Source: local purchase"
5488,MadMadMike,Hercules Double IPA,4.15,"12 ounce bottle into a Great Divide snifter. Clear liquid gold and a nice fluffy foam from an aggressive pour.
Smells like Colorado.,. the dank pine jumps right out, there’s a sweetness on the nose from the malt.
Tastes Big. A punch in the mouth of well balanced maltiness and stanky piney hops. Resiny. Crisp finish featuring a bitter hop note.
High medium to low heavy mouthfeel, medium carbonation.
Overall, I’d drink these every gah dam day if they were sold in Florida.,."
5489,Fordcoyote15,Hercules Double IPA,4.5,"Looks almost crystal clear. Def not hazy. Def my style.

Smells like pot. I cant smoke it but I sure like the smell and beer taste of it.

Tastes super dank. Super weedy. Sweet and caramely with a sticky, sticky resinous piney darkness. Old school as fuck and super big on malt and hops.

Feel is OILY and gelatinous. Finishes very crisp though. Intriguing beer.

Overall - I've definitely had this before but I always seems to ignore great divide for whatever reason. I think im primarily annoyed by their yeti series and how they absolutely try to milk the fuck out off it, but thats another topic. Regardless, its been a LONG time since I've bought a GD beer (probably close to ten years) but this beer is a super nice reminder of where beer was at 10-15 years ago. Very DFH 90 minute-esque as well. An IPA not ashamed to be malty and unpalatable to Virginia beer enthusiasts."
5490,gooddaydiablo,Hercules Double IPA,3.94,"pine pine pine bitter bitter bitter bready bready 

very old school, not hoppy"
5491,TBoneJones,Hercules Double IPA,4,"Citrus hints and malt dominates this dipa and the hops come in the form of deep woods/ pine forest. Other more non-description tropical fruits appear as this warms. You’ll hear others say this really comes to life as it warms. I agree. Tasty stuff. Big pine notes with plenty of sweet nutty/ tea-like malts without the sweetness being a turnoff. Like many also note, the hops don’t dominate here."
5492,KT3418,Hercules Double IPA,3.32,"The can I have isn't expired but not the freshest but this is so malty im wondering if they some how canned a brown ale. If this how this normally is then it's honestly awful to me. Zero hops just malt, like this is so disappointing I'll have to try again to see.


Seeing as how I have the lowest review on here I looked at others and they're all as flabbergasted as I am. I really hope we all got bad bottles or cans and it will be better next time.


Update, after trying again I more or less confirmed what I thought while also liking this more. Still not for me but for those more into malty IPA'S."
5493,KenjiN,G'Knight,4.17,"Hazy red brew with an off-white head. Hoppy nose evocative of grapefruit. Rich, thick malty sweetness -- also plenty of flowery, fruity hoppiness. Warming. This would have enthralled me in the 90s. Today I'm into subtler beers."
5494,Pivopijak,G'Knight,3.99,"draught
Nearly clear, medium dark orange, with the slightest auburn tint. Nice, allspice tinged, medium dark toast caramel malt, with a bit of fruitiness, to the aroma. Some sharpness upfront, lightly astringent, bit of allspice/coriander type sweet spice in the background, with a bit of a floral note to the taste and finish."
5495,JohnnyHopps,G'Knight,4.25,"Appearance - The beer poured a brownish maroon color with a white head. 

Smell - The smell malts and dank hops were just right for the style. 

Taste - The malts backbone was huge, leaving a trail of sweetness. The dank and grassy hops provided a nice contrast. Nothing was overpowering, and a dry finish left me thirsty for more. 

Mouthfeel - The beer was full bodied, allowing the aftertaste to linger. 

Overall - It has been too long since I had this one."

5497,crazyspicychef,G'Knight,3.12,"Too hoppy for my taste.
Otherwise a very solid beer for the style, but not red.
More of a slightly darker honey.
Old Chub is much better!
To me, this tastes like the rest of the IPA's in this style."

L: Hazy, red/amber colour with two fingers of off-white suds that leave rings of lacing.
S: Malt and some subtle cinnamon spiciness.
T: Red liquorice, orange and caramel. Unusual. Alcohol heat follows, as does moderate hop bitterness.
F: Full bodied with slick mouthfeel. 
O: A decent Autumnal red ale that also delivers a boozy hit. Not very subtle, however."
5499,ohbigun,G'Knight,2.95,"Chilled 12 oz. can poured into a chilled mug. Canned 08/28/21 stamped on bottom of can. Consumed 11/06/21. My wife bought a single can of this randomly for me to try. It is the highest-ranked beer on this site that I have consumed to date, rated #3 in the Red Ale - Imperial style and #3,096 overall at time of writing. 

L: Dark amber with a moderate amount of foam. A slight amount of bubbles. 3.75

S: Hard to put a finger on what this smells like. Smells like it will taste sour. It has notes of a typical IPA, but different. 3.0

T: Tastes about like it smells... kind of weird. It has a harshness that sort of overpowers the other flavors of the beverage. This is a higher ABV than I am accustomed to, which might account for the issues. Bitterness from hops is about the only other thing I can discern. I get no sweetness, at all, even as the brew warmed. 2.75

F: Not very easy or enjoyable to drink. 3.0

O: Not for me. 3.0"
5500,RedStickPhil,G'Knight,3.92,"Yet another great Oskar offering! Beautiful to behold, with deeper colors at the top of the glass. I guess just because the top is wider? Anyway, a cool effect 
Maybe just a little malty with the high alcohol content, but great mouthfeel."
5501,Smuggler8787,The Mad Elf,3.75,"It’s a great beer when you don’t get flat ones. I bought a case last week (Jan 13 2024) and 8 bottles were pure syrup. 

When it’s on, it’s a great beer. When it’s off, it’s like drinking cherry Dimeatap."
5502,easyrider1234,The Mad Elf,3.43,"I picked up a 6 pack of bottles from local supermarket late Dec 2023 and i usually drink a few of these for the holidays. not sure if I got a bad batch or if something has changed but I just couldn't finish one. Maybe its me, maybe it was a bad batch, maybe troegs has changed something but the heavy boozy overly sweet taste just didn't do it for me. I usually can drink anything I buy but had to pour out half and gave away the others. Anyone else notice a change in this years mad elf?"
5503,Hayesbro,The Mad Elf,4.18,"Pours a clear copper with a light red tint and a brown head that disappears quickly. Aromas of yeast and cherries. Fairly sweet, those cherries come through but not overwhelmingly, some honey and spiciness. A little heat, fairly thick mouthfeel. This is apparently polarizing here but I think it delivers well on what it promises: Big sweet with cherries but not too much"
5504,Bitterbill,The Mad Elf,3.54,"Freshest by June 21st 2024. From Beer Drop. 

Pours a clear deep amber with a small head of foam, very little lacing. 

The smell is Belgian spices, yeast, cherries, more spices.

The taste is yeasty, cloves, cherries both tart and sweet (honey), massive spiciness, heat from the alcohol, big big flavours, not all of them to my liking. Especially the allspice and cloves. 

Medium bodied, good carbonation. 

I have another can that will be sitting for a while."
5505,Cholla,The Mad Elf,5,You really get the taste of the cherries and a bit of the alcohol up front. The honey taste is on the back end of it. Not bad. The alcohol flavor does become more prominent as you finish the bottle. Couple of these and you’ll be belting out Christmas carols. I recommend it. Cheers.

F-outstandingly smooth. Would never guess this was 11abv. 
O-pleasant Belgian style with a successful cherry element mixed in. Nice to mix in with other holiday beers, as it diverges from the common cinnamon/nutmeg/etc profile."
5507,jadpsu,The Mad Elf,3.59,"Gary D dropped a bottle off for me to try and review. A couple of friends bragged on this offering.
LOOK: Pours a very clear mahogany brown with a tan, light brown head that has decent retention wile settling to a bare minimum with a thin coat of side glass lace.
AROMA: Dark cherries and candied sugars and sweet caramel and booze. Never personally like picking up the scent of alcohol in beer.
TASTE: Up front I get some roasty malts and the dark cherries, it's sweetness blends with the malts and while I pick up some the ABV of 11% it is not as prominent as in the aroma. The after taste of dark or candied cherries lingers 
FEEL: Warming, feels thick, syrupy.
OVERALL: Not my style, very much a sipper, not a thirst quencher. As one completes the 12 ounce bottle the high ABV is noticed."
5508,Virrog280,The Mad Elf,3.62,"Nice amber color, sweet cherry, spices scent. Just regular carbonation, felt heavy in the mouth, almost like I had to chew it. The 11% alcohol is very pronounced, could have been better with it lower. It is a good holiday beer, but would not be my first choice. At 11%, this would get the party going and would be enjoyed."
5509,hbeimers,Nut Brown Ale,4.09,Strongly sweet and molasses-y aroma. Rapidly dissipating head. Clear dark amber. Mouthfeel is somehow both light and syrupy. Very little aftertaste. Delicious

Tastes like nutty caramel, almond, walnut, chestnuts, lightly toasted brown bread, a hint of chocolate, toffee, subtle raisin, dried fruits, apple, apricot, some tobacco, woody cedar, pine resin, and herbal earthy hops.

Medium bodied, light side of medium carbonation, smooth mouth feel."

5515,mothmanscott,Smoked Porter,3.92,"From notes 4/2/12: Pours dark brown with a ruby highlight when held to the light. The pour produces a frothy, tan, short-lived head that receded to nothing and left no lacing. Aroma is dark roast, dark fruit, chocolate, a little cherry and smoke. Taste is the same with heavier dark malt notes and a nice nuttiness with minor hop hints in the finish and a lingering bitter aftertaste. The level of smoke is a little disappointing. The taste is well balanced. Mouthfeel is medium-heavy bodied with nice carbonation, smooth and very drinkable."
5516,greenhousedrummer,Smoked Porter,4,"Not as smoke forward as I like but still an undeniably good beer. It's a bit more on the traditional porter side, with a nice hop bite, caramel sweetness and deep roasted nut aroma. There's a light kiss of smoke but it makes you work for it. Unfortunately, although a good beer, when reaching for a smoky fix I go for O'Fallon's smoked porter, Yazoo Sue, or Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Urbock."

5518,MadMadMike,Shock Top Belgian White,3,"Tap hit at a local seafood place. They added a dollar to the value by calling it a ‘craft beer’, lol.,.
Cold and flat in the chilled mug, a wedge of orange attached. Smells bland, but slightly Sunny D. Taste is ok to rinse a shrimp po’boy down, but I’ll not get a refill.,."
5519,JZH1000,Shock Top Belgian White,3.15,"12oz can

On the pour not even 1 finger of average white head formed then in under a minute it completely dissipates. Despite that and my clean glass, bubbles cling to the side of the glass from excessive carbonation. Hazy golden orange body.

Aroma is light for the style with hints of citrus, but no coriander. A touch metallic with a grainy finish.

Taste is decent, with some nice but subtle orange flavor right in front of an almost sweet, wheaty malty body. A touch doughy. Really not bad, but not quite a full on belgian wit.

Feel is highly carbonated and very refreshing. Much better when poured in a glass than when left in the can. At first it seems like its going to be full bodied, but the body quickly drops off as a dryness sets in. The wheat flavor stacks around for the finish, but this gets light fast. Basically a lawnmower beer.

Overall this is decent for an AB product, but it's too expensive for what it is. I don't get any coriander, and the orange basically replaces any hop character. Not bad to change up the pace from lagers, but not something to give a shot if youn are looking for a quality Belgian style Wit."
5520,DeathMetalJedi,Shock Top Belgian White,5,Lots of snobs giving Shock Top a low rating. Came to even the scale a bit. It's a great refreshing summer beer with citrus. Of all the beers to hate on I don't understand why it would be shock top. Get yourself a six pack next time you're at the beach or grilling in the back yard.
5521,Brainsurgerystudio86,Kellerweis,5,"I’ve been saying (& will continue to say) for many years that Kellerweis is, without question, one of the best American examples of a traditional German Hefeweizen that has ever existed. It’s unfortunate that this is no longer available in packaged form. However, if you are lucky enough, you may be able to find it on draft exclusively at either of the brewery locations."
5522,Elemental19xx,Kellerweis,3.87,"I think their label got it right on the nose ""Our Bavarian-style wheat beer is complex with flavors reminiscent of banana bread and spicy clove. This hazy-golden beer glows with suspended yeast, creating a velvety texture and refreshing finish."" This is one of the few beers where the label is spot on. Very much so enjoy the banana bread flavor going on, as well as the very smooth finish."
5523,Sigmund,Kellerweis,3,"Rerate, 355 ml bottle, Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. I turned the bottle upside down before opening. Hazy yellow colour, small white head of poor retention. The aroma has notes of citrus, and less pronounced notes of cloves and banana. There are also some less pleasant hints of solvent. The flavour is also citrussy, with moderate notes of banana and cloves. Fizzy mouthfeel. 

Original rating: 355 ml bottle, at Peter Gift, Aarhus, Denmark. Deep golden colour, no head at all in the shiny glass, probably due to the pub’s ignorant use of rinse aid / rinse agent. The aroma and flavour have some of the typical notes of a hefeweizen (banana and cloves), but this beer was far from the best h.w. I’ve had (and I love hefeweizens). Fizzy mouthfeel."
5524,TommyG22,Kellerweis,4.58,Very good American Hefeweisse.

5528,colts9016,Daisy Cutter,4.28,"Review: 2003
Name: Daisy Cutter
Brewery: Half Acre Brewing
Location: Chicago, IL
Style: Pale Ale
A.B.V. 5.2%
Date: Oct 2023
I am drinking Daisy Cutter today using a Willie Belcher. I served it at 42 degrees. The pour created an airy, foamy, creamy, three-fingered, white head with above-average retention. The color is golden yellow with pale straw hues, charting around S.R.M. 6. The beer is clear with carbonation bubbles. The dissipation left lots of lacing on the glass. The appearance is above average for this style. 
The aromas are floral, soft herbal, orange, mangos, peaches, toasted biscuits, and a bit of resin. The aromas are vibrant and fresh. 
The flavors are floral, herbal, earthy, grassy, mangos, orange peel, peaches, pine needles, lightly toasted malts, and biscuity—a big, no-frills pale ale with a firm, malty backbone. 
The mouthfeel is soft yet astringent, finishing somewhat tannic. The body is medium and has medium carbonation. 
It's an easy sipper with lots of flavor for a Pale Ale. The flavors are fresh and bright. The malts are not overbearing or sweet. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer; I wish I had access to it in the summer; it would be one of my go-to beers for camping."
5529,GavinRoddy,Daisy Cutter,4.53,"Huge fan of this beer. Although not my favorite, it is my go to at any bar that offers it. I love everything Half Acre does and the Daisy Cutter is definitely one of their best! Super easy to drink, not too filling, and a great abv."

Appearance: Pours a deep amber with faint haze

Smell: Faint hop aromas with biscuit malt notes

Taste: Follows the nose, with some pine and citrus notes

Mouthfeel: leads to a crisp-satisfying finish 

Overall: A very pleasant Pale Ale that certainly sets itself apart and I will always seek it out in the future when I am in the Chicagoland area."
5532,chinchill,Daisy Cutter,4,"16 oz can. 
Appearance. Clear amber body with high clarity and a very good white head. 

Moderate strength and bitterness for the style with high complexity. Hints of pine, herbs, grass, and fruits."
5533,PSanger,Daisy Cutter,4.29,"As mentioned all the time, this beer is super Dank for a pale ale. Really good thin mouth feel and an easy drink. Has all of the good characteristics of a pale ale and some great qualities of an ipa. Well worth searching for if not in the Midwest. Well done."
5534,jkrich,Daisy Cutter,3.76,"Poured from a freshness dated 16 oz. can: slightly hazy, deep golden-orange with a sustained, foamy white head.

The aroma is mainly tropical fruit and some faint pine. 

The first sip, just after pouring into the glass, nearly took my head off because it was so bracingly bitter and seemed very thin-bodied. Please let this one warm in the glass for a few minutes before quaffing as it will calm the bitterness and give flavors of bittersweet tropical fruit and mango as well as hints of pine. This one drinks like an IPA to me. I prefer my pales ales less bracing with a well-rounded body. I'm still glad I tried it."
5535,cjgiant,Daisy Cutter,3.92,"Can dated 7/6 (month-plus):
Pours a amber nearing copper with a near clear body and a bunch of head. Lacing is a bit clumpy, but pretty strong. Nose seems trying to throw a little citrus into a grassy bitterness along with some grain dry toast. Taste opens with a bit of a grain tea from lightly toasted malts. This doesn't last too long on a cold beer, but lingers longer on a warming beer. Grassy notes from the aroma grow out of this fairly steadily and into full strength at the finish. A copper note leaks in on a cold beer, but isn't really noticed at all at the preferred temp. The beer is pretty dry, which seems to accentuate the bitterness, which turns a bit dank at the end and in the finish. This offering from Half Acre has more of an old school IPA vibe to it than an actual IPA of theirs I recently tried."
5536,MadMadMike,Daisy Cutter,4.18,"Pint can poured into a pint glass. Imagine that., Canned in Chicago, IL on 6/13/23. (That’s 25 days old. We don’t sometimes get Cigar City Jai Alai that fresh 130 miles from the tit.,.)
Aroma of unoffensive pine and citrus zest.
Taste bursts low and kinda dank. A wave of malt is in the mix. Nice balanced finish. Mmmm., really good dry finish. 
Mouthfeel is narrow, center of the tongue. Medium carbonation suits it well.
Overall, a ‘little’ beer that delivers a satisfying six minutes worth of your time."
5537,travis1108,Special Double Cream Stout,3.94,"An excellent beer. Malty flavor with a medium mouth feel. It doesn't seem all that creamy when I'm drinking it but after I swallow it a creamy mouth feel remains. I would like a little more chocolate/coffee but this is okay because it doesn't have that sickly sweet taste. Hardly any any alcohol taste. I know that might be a negative for some people, but tonight it's exactly what I'm craving.
Excellent with chocolate donuts. Then again, what is it excellent with chocolate donuts?"

5540,DarkLordScott,Special Double Cream Stout,3.54,"Pours dark brown with a very nice one finger head. Aroma is nice roasted malt. There is a degree of sweetness to the aroma as well. Taste is on the lighter side of moderate, sweet, with roasted malt though not as much as hinted at by the aroma. The brew is smooth and creamy. The ABV is nearly absent. A bit on the watery side for my personal taste but drinkable."
5541,Whyteboar,Special Double Cream Stout,4.09,"Poured stout black and, much to my surprise, had virtually no head but left off-white lacing.
The aroma was mild for my nose, but that’s normal. I did get that lactose sweetened malt and smooth coffee.
The taste features malts galore, cocoa and chocolate and coffee and toast and the expected sweetness was present, just not as a major player.
The feel was a bit thin for a stout, especially a double, but as the ABV makes it possible to drink more than one without falling over, the thinness works in its favor.
Glad it’s local, I get some every year, just never rated it before."

5544,BitteNochEinWeissbier,Special Double Cream Stout,3.87,"12 oz bottle
Glass: Nonic Pint
Temp at Pour: 47 F
ABV: 6.1%


Look:
Very dark brown-to-black with some chestnut highlights when held up to a light. 1-finger dark tan/light brown head that quickly dissipates to a thing cover and then that begins to disappear. I suspect that the age of this bottle is a factor, here.

Smell: 
Sweet roasted oats and rich semi-sweet chocolate. Touch of coffee here and there.

Taste: 
Initial molasses sweetness is quickly joined by roasted oats and some char. The semi-sweet chocolate appears and transitions to bittersweet chocolate and obvious coffee notes emerge. Anise shows up near the end. Finishes on a sweet fading chocolate and molasses note.

Feel: 
Smooth and creamy. Body is in the heavier side of medium

Overall: 
This stout is a perennial favorite of mine. I pick up at least a 6 pack each year, if I can. The coffee and chocolate notes remind of coffee stouts, but are much less in your face. The heavier body is nice. Somehow, this particular bottle hid in the cellar for 2 years. It didn't last long after I found it."

T - follows the nose with semi sweet chocolate and roasted dark malts intermixed with sweet cream and coffee along with a somewhat nutty finish
F - medium bodied with light to medium carbonation. Smooth and velvety, but a little thin on the finish 
O - a nice milk stout that doesn't really do anything wrong."
5546,JacobusFavier23,Big Bad Baptist,4.09,"Pours a jet black body with a lacy tan head. The head was about a quarter inch on the pour. There is some visible carbonation towards the bottom that grows towards the top. 

Aroma is off the bat, an immediate mix of dark cocoa, roasted malt and coffee. I then get a good note of vanilla followed by a woody bourbon barrel aroma. There are also some notes of stone, fruit and raisin. 

Follows the nose. Sweet, but not overly so. Notes of dark chocolate, coffee and roasted malt. This leads into a bitter finish that works well with the coffee. Some raisin follows. At the end there is some woody bourbon notes that work great with the that bitterness as well. 

Medium bodied. Solid carb which is surprising.

O-Very well done imperial stout that is a treat to enjoy. I will seek this one out again."

5548,NorsemanOne,Big Bad Baptist,4.71,"Release #157

Purchased from the dabc for $5

12oz can poured into a snifter glass at about 45°F and let warm.

Pours a deep inky black with whiskey brown edges and a dark mocha head. Very reflective deep black body that is nearly mirror like. Fine ring persists after the head dies down. 4.5

Off the can the aroma is big and hot whiskey while off the glass I get raw cocoa, semi-sweet bakers chocolate, and tobacco with a hint of well burnt malt. 4.75

Taste follows, whiskey takes a back seat in favor of the chocolate, cacao nibs, medium roast coffee, and tobacco. It's truly delightful, and holds up exceedingly well at room temp for an extended time. 4.75

Hardly any boozy warmth for this batches 11.4%abv. Lingering chocolate and lightly earthy hop oil finish. Very moderate nearly light for the style which makes this dangerously drinkable. 4.5

Overall I have seriously under appreciated this year round BCBS equivalent and a fraction of the price. Enjoyed significantly more than BBBaptista and will certainly make a return to my fridge regularly. 4.75"
5549,dd53grif,Big Bad Baptist,4.35,"Pours a dark brown color with virtually no head. Aroma of coffee, chocolate and roasted malts. Taste is black coffee and dark chocolate with a good amount of alcohol warmth. Smooth and creamy."
5550,JamFuel,Big Bad Baptist,4.24,"Pours jet black with low, tan head.

Smell is roasted with notes of coffee, coffee grounds, dark chocolate and tobacco.

Taste is roasted and a bit sweet with notes of coffee, chocolate, bourbon and vanilla. Some hints of cured meat and a bit of bitterness.

Mouthfeel is medium, soft and well carbonated.

Overall, a very nice, pretty laid back impy."
5551,Rotundum,Big Bad Baptist,4.38,"Pored great, it went exceptionally well with a cigarette. Very thick and strong bodied, but not in a bad way. My only complaint is that the head takes forever to dissipate, regardless of how you pour.

For taste, I have to give it a 9/10, honestly one of the best bottle of beers I have ever had."
5552,highdesertdrinker,Big Bad Baptist,4.49,"Pours a dark brown black with a little tan head. The aroma kills; chocolate coffee, bourbon with the taste those same qualities, with a strong presence from the barrel, it’s like FBS on steroids, delicious, and oh so easy to drink at this high abv. Epic has a winner with this one and will definitely keep an eye peeled for this in the future!"
5553,Christianriveraaa,Big Bad Baptist,4.63,"Look: Poured from a 12oz can into a sniffer - Jet black pour with about a fingers length of foam risen to the surface. A bit of lacing is left behind as it dissolves back into liquid form. Pours quite thin for a 11.8%.
Smell: Getting big notes of chocolate - rich baking chocolate. Getting some caramel and toffee as well as some molasses too. Not to much on the coffee notes here or bourbon/whiskey either.
Taste: First you get a coffee aromic taste followed by the chocolatey that backs it up. The thing that stands out the most is definitely the chocolate. I'm getting hints of oaky-ness and vanilla as well. It's rich yet not to heavy in a sense that you can drink it easily. The alcohol is very well hidden and that's surprising being a 11.8% beer. I didn't get much of a whiskey taste in this and this might be due to ageing it for months in a barrel vs some places do years. Even though the whiskey/ bourbon barrels aren't to present but it's a very good sipper.
Feel: This is so smooth that you can't even tell it's a heavy beer. It's not chewy or oily at all, very light carbonation - might throw a lot of people off by this alone yet so smooth. Easy sipper for sure.
Overall: I was hesitant paying the price for a four pack but man I'm glad I got to experience this. I'll definitely be buying again and even aging some to see how it turns out."
5554,Iamaskier,Big Bad Baptist,4,"Smell is huuuge spicy bourbon notes, chocolate, marshmallow, and a hint of coffee. Taste is plenty of bourbon, coffee, and dark chocolate, with oaky hints. I think the feel is what throws me off. Very nice heat behind it, but not as thick or as carbonated as expected. 
Overall I think the feel distracts from the taste a bit, which is too bad because the balance of coffee and bourbon is phenomenal."
5555,DrOfGolf,Big Bad Baptist,4.46,"Pours out a black color with a beige head. Smell is of whiskey, coffee, dark chocolate and malt. The taste is of whiskey, coffee, cocoa, dark chocolate, malt, oak, and vanilla. Very good and I had this one for breakfast along with my usual straight black cup of coffee. Great!! I'll be drinking more of this type for sure."
5556,MadMadMike,Big Bad Baptist,4.62,"12 ounce can into an Epic snifter, poured at 50°. 
Deep night black with a generous finger of dense foam.
Smell on the spin is Coffee up front, malt sweetness right behind.
Taste is roasty malt, fresh pulled espresso, rich dark cacao, sweet tobacco. The bourbon barrel is subtle, but present. Coffee is the star of this show.
Feel is smooth, decadently rich, light to medium carbonation.
Overall: Beautifully smooth coffee Stout sipper, very well-executed and balanced. One of Anerica’s Best."
5557,LiquidAmber,420 Extra Pale Ale,3.67,"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a lightly hazy, medium golden amber with a three finger white head with good retention and lots of lacing. Aroma of biscuit malt, citrus hops, lemon, grapefruit and a faint vegetal note. Flavor is biscuit malt, citrus hops, lemon, grapefruit and a little grassy hay; flavor drops off precipitously in the finish leaving mostly grassy hops lingering. Medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess. The nice looking pour and old fashioned aroma gave me some hope for this one and the initial taste is solid, if one-note, hops and a good biscuity malt base, but the finish ended abruptly and left a watered-down memory of the initial taste. It's satisfactory, but with so many fine pale ales around, I won't be seeking it out again."
5558,Hmmmmm,420 Extra Pale Ale,3.69,"Not shite. Not overly exciting. These were on sale at Publix, so I gave it a whirl.

Steep at 5.7 abv for how light it tastes.

I guess think rolling rock meets Sierra Nevada meets Atlanta city water.

Not bad.

I don't hate it."
5559,Tofuteus,420 Extra Pale Ale,4.03,Overall what I expect from a pale ale. A little on the mild side as far as hoppiness and bitterness. A very easy drinking ale. But has a kick that doesn't disappoint. A very nice beer experience.
5560,AzfromOz,420 Extra Pale Ale,3.6,"Poured at Black Taps in Singapore in October 2023. 

L: Hazy, dark golden orange. Thin rim of bright white head. Lacing in the glass. No carbonation seen.

S: Mild, hoppy orange and peach. 

T: Reminds me of an orange Berroca (which might just be an Australian thing for all I know...). Mild, bitter orange peel and flesh. A touch of tropical hops. Nice retronasal bitterness. Dry finish. 

M: Full mouthfeel with low carbonation and a slightly chalky residual. Leaves a nice bitter coating on the tongue. 

O: The overall mildness of the beer in the mouth surprised me as I had drunk the Sweetwater session beer the day before and expected more kick from this one. Not getting that outcome made me mark this one down. 

Cheers!

5562,burnonethird,420 Extra Pale Ale,4.75,"It's about a perfect Pale Ale as you can get. The beer has a spot between Sierra Nevada and an IPA. More flavor than Sierra but not as robust as a standard IPA. At 5.7% it is perfect for summertime drinking. Pale Ale are my favorite beers. If you're a pale ale fan, then take it from me, this is good."

O - Easy drinking Pale Ale."
5566,FRANKHAZE,420 Extra Pale Ale,2.85,It's pretty watery. Sweetwater just like the name. Faint aroma of hops. Grassy pale look. If budwesiser produced PA it would taste like this one.
5567,JZH1000,Samuel Adams Cherry Wheat,2.92,"12oz bottle best by June 2024

On the pour, almost 2 fingers of fizzy white head form on too of a yellow body with a medium to full haze.

Aroma is slightly malty, but mostly dominated by a sweet cherry flavor that reminds me of candy. I can't really get much else.

Flavor is more balanced than the aroma, but the aroma is so strong that it influences the flavor more than usual. Beyond the light maltiness and sweet cherry, the beer is surprisingly light.

Feel is highly carbonated, and again, surprisingly light. I will say it is very easy to drink, but it does have a thicker than usual finish from the extra sweetness. 

Overall, this beer is dominated by cherry, in every category. The wheat isn't as present as I'd like, and somehow the flavor verges on boring after the relatively intense aroma. Drinkable, but not much more than that."
5568,Cdriver0414,Samuel Adams Cherry Wheat,4.5,One of my favorite Sam Adams brews. The strong cherry notes do limit the number of beer drinkers that will enjoy this one. The cherry and the wheat work so well for me. It's easy drinking and full of flavor. If you love cherry you will love this.
5569,mhhsvt,Samuel Adams Cherry Wheat,3.39,"Not bad, in fact pretty good! The abundant smell and taste of cherrys would make George Washington Blush!!!"
5570,Broski1989,Samuel Adams Cherry Wheat,3.42,"Sam Adams Cherry wheat is a decent seasonal beer. Granted you can find it on the shelves outside the fall & winter months, but it really belong there. It’s not nearly as refreshing drinking it on a hot summer day as opposed to a chilly fall or winter day/night. 

It has a bite when first taking a mouthful, but finishes nicely. The cherries are noticeable at first, but after having more than one beer in a given setting you don’t really notice the cherry taste anymore. Hence it’s not very vibrant it’s just there. It also sits on the heavier side too so a 6 pack is generally enough for any one given person at a time."
5571,DERTYthegrower,Samuel Adams Cherry Wheat,4.42,"I just want to say, I have tried many cherry beers, especially Michigan cherry beers and PNW Cherry beers...
This is hands down the best cherry beer I can drink all day, or if I had to pick one cherry beer.. this is the one I would drink many times. For sure. Most other cherry beer is tart and not sweet...this one is like if a normal light American lager had a hybrid with a bit of cherry coke just for some smooth lager cherry flavor. I have bought many times, very rarely is it a bad batch. Would recommend."
5572,brewerburgundy,Samuel Adams Cherry Wheat,3.62,"12oz bottle, tulip, best by May 2023. An office Christmas gift as part of a mixed six. 

The color is rather golden, with perhaps a nod of pink, though that could simply be the suggestion. The head was average and not long lasting. 

I smell beer and cherry smoothie. I find the cherry aroma pleasant and real, though it’s more like real cherry ice cream or a smoothie than fresh cherries. Sweet, creamy, fruity, small tang. 

The taste very much follows; cherry yogurt, pale wheat ale base. There is some bitterness to the finish, which is mostly clean with a lingering sweetness like from one of them flavored sparkling waters that’re all the rage. 

Moderate body and carbonation. You can tell there’s wheat in it by a slight matte feel to it. 

I’m a bit surprised given the reputation this beer at least used to have on this site. I’d say a good word to describe it is “pleasant”, as long as you’re in the mood for something light and fruity. C’mon, it’s clearly for non-beer drinkers or beginners."

Taste - a ton of complex malt flavor, ranging from lightly toasted to caramel notes. honey-like sweetness. low on hoppiness. finish is smooth and slightly creamy.

Feel - medium bodied but feels quite light. moderate carbonation. sessionable at 4.8% ABV.

Overall - a very tasty farmhouse ale with cream ale characteristics and moderate complexity."

Look - (4) Poured cloudy-gold with a 1/2 inch head that dissipated to a small ring around a filmy top. A little lacing. 

Smell - (3.5) Not overly strong. Tart, juicy grapefruit and straw with some honey coming in underneath. 

Taste - (4.5) Taste followed smell. Really nice evolution. Started off tart and straw-y with a honey sweetness that gradually transitioned to juicy grapefruit juice. A bit of bitter allspice in the middle and a slightly bitter cherry-pit astringency at the end. Tannic aftertaste on the tongue. 

I let it warm a bit and sipped some more. A bit sweeter and waterier. The honey notes were more prominent. 

Feel - (3.75) Effervescent and juicy. A slightly syrup-y mouthfeel. As it warmed, it thinned out a bit.

Overall - (4.5) A wonderful treat! Picked up a 6-pack when I was across the Wisconsin border and am not disappointed! A very pleasant, tart beer. An excellent farmhouse ale."

Nose: Fresh sweet grain — very pleasant and inviting.

Attack: Follows the nose but not quite as sweetly or fully.

Finish: Hop bitterness is just about right.

Overall: Not bad, but the balance would be better if the attack was as sweet and full as the nose."

toasted malts, caramel, and herbal hops. Flavors follow the nose with 
nicely toasted malts, caramel, light breaded notes, and balanced herbal
and zesty hop notes. Mouth feel is medium light teetering on light with 
medium light carbonation, and a balanced bitter hop finish that is lightly
dry and crushable.

5593,bristol2120,Honker's Ale,3,"Deep copper orange in color. Head fades quickly leaving a bit of lacing. There is not much to be found in the nose, very subdued. Taste approximates what you would expect of the style, but there was a very slight hint of smokiness in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is smooth, with understated carbonation. This is a fairly inoffensive take on a style that is overlooked by many brewers. Not bad, but not really anything to go out of your way for."
5594,Rug,Honker's Ale,3.71,"The first beer of my trip to Chicago for Riot Fest! Honkers is one of those beers always spoken fondly of by old school BAs, and I figure there’s no better way to start off the trip than with this beer I don’t see in Massachusetts. Let’s dive in

Pours a cloudy deep orange amber with 2 fingers of light tan head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing

It doesn’t have all that much presence in the nose, but what’s there is pretty good. I’m picking up on aromas of biscuity malt, floral hops, lemon zest, honey, and light pepper

It’s a bit more expressive in taste, but still not a punch in the face or anything. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting herbal hops, crackery malt, honey, orange zest, and green tea. The swallow brings notes of black tea, floral hops, biscuity malt, honey, toasted grain, and light orange

A light medium body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a crisp beer. Finishes mostly dry but a bit watery

5601,Orca,Mirror Pond Pale Ale,3.9,"Re-reviewing this one as it’s been a dozen years since I last reviewed it.

12oz can (5/16/2023) into a tulip. Pours a clear amber color with a huge billowing almost Duvel-like eggshell head with lots of sticky lace. 

Aroma is hoppy and grassy, floral. Piney Northwest hops, fragrant sweet malt. 

Taste is a blend of bready caramel malt and floral hops; light bitterness. Clean water. Nicely balanced. Very old school. 

Mouthfeel is soft, medium bodied, crisp, drinkable. Something about it is vaguely reminiscent of beers brewed with Belgian yeast.

Overall a tasty, classic approach to the APA, one of my first go-to beers from the ‘90s. It’s somehow comforting to know that beers like this are still being made.

Color is a slightly hazy copper with a beautiful 1-finger head, good carbonation.

Aroma is floral and herbal hops.

Taste is floral, bitter hops with a nice pale malt balance. This beer straddles the line between a pale ale and an IPA. Used to drink this often and it's been way too long.

Served in an oversized, stemless, wine glass
BOTTLED ON: 021323

This beer pours a hazy golden hue and is topped with a mountain of creamy, beige head that leaves rocky lacing.

Not as aromatic as some BPSAs that I have had, especially the ones from Belgium. I get some spiced pear with hints of banana.

Mild spiced pear flavor. I get some Belgian esters, but it is really not all that flavorful.

Thin bodied with a chalky, yet creamy mouthfeel

My buddy gave me this because he didn't like it, so I can't complain about the price. I love the head on this beer. The flavor does improve as it warms, but there is just nothing to make it stand out other than the fact that this beer was a pioneer in the style. It is a classic, but with approximately 1 billion breweries now in existence, it doesn't really stand out from the crowd."
5608,TheBricenator,Damnation,4.59,"Look: Golden yellow and nearly clear with a silky-looking white head that settles to a lid, leaving a ring of lacing behind
Aroma: Wet hay, floral hop notes, wafts of lemon, straw, some Belgian yeast funk, pear esters, and crackers. This smells awesome
Taste: Flowers and lemon come together and strike first with a plethora of strong citrus blossoms, butterfly bush, and honeysuckle that quickly deepen and intermingle. Wet hay, yeast funk, and pear gain momentum and mix well with the floral/lemon combo as the whole entirety of flavors continue to deepen throughout until it closes with straw, yeast funk, and crackers
Mouthfeel: Full, silky smooth, medium-high carbonation, and smooth and soft on the finish but with a light kiss of dryness
Overall: Simply put – this beer is awesome. I haven’t had, had access to, nor seen this beer in probably 12 years so when I spotted it, I had to have it for old times’ sake and also since this beer helped me develop my palate for Belgian-Style ales. A ridiculously well-made and flavorful Golden Ale that is easy to drink and has seemingly endless flavors/aromas that come on more with each sip (and warming). A classic and one I would easily but frequently if possible. Highly recommended"
5609,hman43,Damnation,4.03,"Look: It pours yellow and quite clear with a pillow like white head. It has excellent head retention. 

Smell: There is pronounced grainy malts in the aroma. It has some light spices in the nose with a touch of pear. 

Taste: There are some Belgian funk elements with malty grain. There are some spicy elements with light banana and pear. 

Feel: It has a medium body with an easy drinking finish. 

Overall, the balance between flavors is quite good, but the aroma is lighter than I like."
5610,HipCzech,Damnation,4.13,"Serving: 375 ml bottle (“bottled on 111722”) poured into a 14 oz Teku glass.

Smell: Grassy, fruity, pale malt and yeasty, phenolic cloves and spice.

Taste: More cloves, pepper, fruity but dry malt body.

Mouthfeel: Medium body and crisp carbonation.

Overall: A solid Belgian-style golden ale with nice balance of malt, hops and spicy, funky yeast."

Russian River Brewing
Date: 08 May 2020
Drinking through one of the lists on BeerAdovcate, this beer is next on the docket. I served the beer in a chalice around 46 degrees. The pour created a massive two-fingered creamy but airy white head. The retention is excellent, leaving gobs of lacing on the glass. The color charts around SRM 8, dark golden yellow with amber hues. The clarity is clear with loads of carbonation. A beautiful appearance. 

The aromas in the beer are cloves, phenols, floral, toasted crackers, banana, a touch of funk, and earthiness. 

I taste cloves, phenols, floral, herbal, green grass, toasted crackers, bready, a hint of funk, orange, banana, and earthiness.

The mouthfeel is dry and spicy. 

The body is medium, has high carbonation, and has a lasting finish. 

I was expecting a big, malty, and spicy Belgium beer. I got a lighter malty Belgium Beer with a dry, spicy finish. A unique take on this style. I enjoyed the differences in this beer."

5613,MetalRugMan,Summer Shandy,5,the perfect beer on a hot summers day. I have turned multiple people onto this brew.
5614,JohnniEMc,Summer Shandy,3.48,"Two brown twelve ounce bottles were emptied into a clear glass liter mug. The pours produced a modest stark white head on top of dull and largely opaque yellow-amber liquid. It smells of lemon, but without any citrusy edge, as it's dampened by the wheat. The taste is much closer to undersweetened lemonade, as it presents a little more citrus. There's a bit of a wheat beer character here, but it's mostly as a light and thin body. This is a case of it is what it is, meant to be liked by people that don't really like the taste of beers. Any hopping at all is hard to find. But, it delivers what's expected about as well as could be. It's a beer, albeit a wheat beer and that makes it better than almost any lemon flavored seltzer. The fruit masks one of the faults of wheat beers, that annoying sort of metallic reference during the finish. It's there, but mostly masked. This is neither too sweet, nor too sour. The head was not maintained, nor was there much lacing in the glass. Recommended? Not really, unless this is a style you really like. Then, it is what it is."
5615,LeinenkugelDrinker,Summer Shandy,4.36,"One of my absolute favorite beers (hence the nickname). Not an ordinary tasting beer, and a lot of people claim it has too light a taste. However, it’s a Weiss beer and is supposed to be crisp and refreshing. Samuel Adams Porch Rocker has a little more lemon flavor in it, but I feel that the Summer Shandy has better drink-ability. Great way to change things up when regular beers just aren’t cutting it."
5616,Death_Adder,Summer Shandy,3,"Having really enjoyed the Samuel Adams Porch Rocker of a similar style, and really enjoying that, I was very let down by this beer. It tasted like Lemonheads candy that had been shaken up in a water bottle and then poured into a lager. Very watery and artificial tasting.

5617,datstankadank,Summer Shandy,3.14,"Was looking for something akin to cider, only one, and after work, and it's a very rare urge for me. Didn't see anything that matched so i went with a 24 oz of this. Havent had it in years, last i recall was a very artificial pine sol after taste. Seems to be gone in the smell, pours a hazy big lasting head, good retention and lace. Tastes sweet with lemon zest i assume to balance on the finish. Decent enough."
5618,ramseye4,Summer Shandy,3.17,Lemon mixed with a faint Weiss beer. Good mouthfeel weak smell. Overall it’s sippable but not stellar. Old Lemonade is the most prominent taste. Not bad on a hot day though
5619,KP7,Summer Shandy,3.39,"This is a situational beer. Tons of lemon and lemon zest for aroma and taste. Nice smooth feel. This shandy is something I'd be pleased to find at an outdoor party with it is 85+ out, or in the fridge after doing yard work. However, other than those times when you need something really refreshing (and maybe should be hydrating with something other than a beer anyway), the lemon would probably be too much."
5620,UncleReemus78,Hefe-Weissbier Naturtrüb,5,"Wheat beer at it's finest. This is one of the best hefeweizen's available next to Weihenstephaner and Franziskaner. I highly recommend this to those looking for wheat beer with class. It is a true hefeweizen, brewed in Germany, and truly highlights the flavor profile and characteristics that define a wheat beer. I gave this brew a 5 star rating. It deserves it."
5621,HorseheadsHophead,Hefe-Weissbier Naturtrüb,4.01,"Comes in a very dark gold color, bordering on light brown. Hazed, but still transparent. Nice creamy white cap of head. Great retention and lacing!

Not getting much aroma through the thick head. Malted wheat, some sweetness, faint apple and banana notes.

Nice pop of sweetness upfront; banana bread, green apple skins, lemon zest, green/unripe banana, hint of clove, but more so hay on the finish. Finishes clean and crisp with just a touch of lingering sweetness.

Nice mouthfeel, fluffy carbonation, pillowy head, smooth body, crisp finish without wateriness.

A fantastic German Hefeweizen. I'd rank Weihenstephaner higher as my favorite, but this comes close. It's one of the best Hefeweizens you're going to easily find."
5622,aeranu,Hefe-Weissbier Naturtrüb,4.42,"Another Hefeweizen I can always count on. 

Paulaner Hefeweizen smells like Banana and fresh bread with some slight citrus aftertaste. It looks like the standard wheat beer— albeit a bit darker than usual brands. It’s cloudy, golden and foamy. The taste is where it’s at— starting of with a hint of spices and citrus before evolving into a bready and bitter finish. The tastes linger in your mouth for many minutes after your last sip. One of the best Hefeweizens ever!"
5623,Hephaistos,Hefe-Weissbier Naturtrüb,4.25,"500ml bottle, 5,5% abv, Poured in a Wiessenglass. Yellow Amber hazy colour. 2 finger off-white head. Small to medium bubbles carbonation.
Smell, bread, banana, clove, little citric acidity.
Smouth mouth feel. Taste a little bit more nutty and more spiced than most Weissenbeers. Light bitter yeasty aftertaste. 
Very good beer, However, being one of the more expensive ones in its category, I'd rather buy the more drinkable and smoother Franziskaner."
5624,KleinSchwein,Hefe-Weissbier Naturtrüb,3.74,"Poured from a 500ml bottle .

Pours milky orange-brown , plenty of sediment with a short lived thin white head , a bit ugly. 
The smell is strong funky yeast ,wheat , citrus and maybe a touch of honey a d the taste follows on with yeast leading the way in an almost Belgiun ale fashion ,there's bags of orange , coriander, Christmas spices a mild sweetness and scant bitterness.
The mouthfeel is borderline foamy in a good way , not at all watery . 
Overall, disappointing to look at but once tasted it's a different story . Somewhat strange and an acquired taste but once you get into it it's like a German weissbier meets a Belgian pale ale in flavour and it works very very well."
5625,dbl_delta,Hefe-Weissbier Naturtrüb,4.04,"Undated can into pint glass. Pours a medium honey color with a frothy, long-lasting white head. Initial imprssion is sweet wheat, cloves, banana, bready malt, and a bit of spiciness. Mouthfeel is clean and crisp. Overall, a very enjoyable and drinkable Hefeweizen. Its high scores are well-deserved."
5626,scott451,Hefe-Weissbier Naturtrüb,4.17,"Poured a 500ml can into a pint glass. A two finger off white head on a cloudy apricot. Good head retention. Lots of lacing.
Clove and banana in the nose.
Again cloves, spice and yeast flavor.
Light body and moderate carbonation.
Overall an excellent Hefeweizen. Well worth a try."
5627,raphhix,Anchor Porter,3.97,"I am pretty certain that Anchor Porter was the first porter I ever drank, around 1986, probably the second opaque beer after Guinness. I have only had it occasionally in the intervening years, calibrating the wide variety of other porters, stouts and other high gravity beers I've enjoyed since then. I hunted around and bought this 6-pack the week the bankruptcy was announced and have been savoring it since then. Not sure I can really provide a proper review for the beer that was my introduction to the style, but here goes.

Pours a deep brown, only allowing transmission of a little ruddy light around the edges. Foam is cream colored, but not long lasting. Smell is roasted grain, very clean. Taste starts with malt and a hint of cocoa or chocolate, roasted grain comes on strong soon thereafter. Feel is smooth and very dry for the style, the result of more hops than a typical (english) porter and the roasted grain. Overall, this is a very flavorful but light bodied, for the style and color, beer. This beer (and later Schwarzbiers) has always been my answer to those who say dark beer is too heavy."
5628,jjamadorphd,Anchor Porter,3.87,"Decent porter...

I found this to be a roasted flavored porter - medium-bodied, with a similar experience to the nose. It was boozier than the 5.6 ABV advertised which added a dimension to the overall experience."
5629,DoctorRobert1969,Anchor Porter,4,Solid Anchor quality. Leaning into stout bitterness territory but not too much.
5630,TwentyDimes,Anchor Porter,4.23,"Opened on Nov 10th. Poured to a shaker.
Dark brown, thick semi creamy coffee foam slowly reduced to thin, spot lacing.
Shy nose to start then classic candied raisin chocolate with touch of herbal, spicy, and coffee nose. I can smell it all day.
Same dried fruits and sweet spicy malty notes, following to moderately long, mouth coating, layered finish.
Medium body and weight, clean, full richness, signature Anchor carbonation and mouthfeel.
It is an excellent porter, packed with flavor, complexity, and balance, so crushable. Again, it is sad to see this go."
5631,KP7,Anchor Porter,4.42,"Pours a dark brown with ruby edges when held to the light. Two and a half fingers of tan/brown head form readily and linger.

Aromas of dark chocolate, cocoa, dark roast coffee, with some molasses-like sweetness and dark fruit as well.

The taste is superb, with not-quite-dark chocolate, cocoa, and brownie at the fore of the sip. Bitter characteristics quickly come through, though, keeping things from getting too sweet. Roast grain, roast coffee, and char turn those initial flavors into dark chocolate and fudge brownie. Then as it warms things change up again with a lighter sweetness becoming present bringing along caramel, toffee, milk chocolate, and dark fruit. It finishes dry with dark chocolate lingering on the palate through the aftertaste.

The carb comes out easily on the pour to form a robust head, leaving a low carb beer in its wake. It works well here, contributing to a smooth and medium-light body.

Overall, this is a great porter that checks all of the boxes for me. Porter is my favorite style and this has been a memorable one, potentially the best mass-market Porter I've had."
5632,dcotom,Anchor Porter,4.06,"Poured from 12-ounce bottle into a Willi Becher glass. Appearance leaves nothing to be desired. Cola-colored body with ruby highlights, a thick long-lasting light tan head, good retention and lacing. For my money, this reaches its peak at near room temperature. Roasty and a little bitter, with notes of caramel, chocolate, toffee, and dark fruit coming to the fore. Medium-light in body, with a bit of astringence and a sour note lingering on the finish. Overall, an outstanding beer. Hopefully Anchor will find some way to carry on."
5633,cheeseheadinMinneapolis,Anchor Porter,4.12,"Bottled on 03-28-2023. Enjoyed on 7/30/2023 This my second bottle. I had the first on on 7/28/2023. For some reason this bottle is better and has more robust flavor.
Impressive head with a aggressive pour, leaves plenty of lacing.
Flavor is roast, chocolate, caramel, and a hint of dark fruit. Plus a micro hint of coffee. Rather smooth and slightly bitter overall. 
A solid beer, kinda old school."
5634,jzeilinger,Anchor Porter,4,"Bottled on: 06-09-22

A - Pitch black pour with a frothy layer of creamy foam resting on top.

S - Nice roasty chocolate and coffee malt aroma with a touch of char.

T - Chocolate roast, a slight bit of coffee, some toffee, and a hint of dark fruit. Finishes with a pleasing lingering chocolate coffee char. There's also a very slight bit of astringency.

M - Medium body with soft prickly carbonation.

O - Solid and glad to finally find this one, first time ever noticing it on the shelf."
5635,MNJR,Anchor Porter,4.38,"Roasty, smooth, flavors of cocoa, fruit (raisin and prune come to mind), slightly spicy. Sits well with me, and sips well with me. An old favorite, a classic, great porter beer."
5636,defunksta,Anchor Porter,4.14,"Appearance: Pours a dark, nearly black color with a mild tan head. SRM of 23. (3.75)

Aroma: Strong aromas of English and dark chocolate, some coffee and hints of dark malt and molasses underneath. (4.00)

Favor: Strong flavors of bittersweet chocolate, dried cocoa powder, with some coffee and dark malt. Balanced by dry finish. (4.25) 

Feel: Medium-bodied, roasted grainy mouthfeel. Balanced. (4.00)

Compared to Einstok Icelandic Porter 1/7/2023: Pours similar, milder aromas. More chocolate and roast. Less bittersweetn chocolate and English cream. Roastier, dryer, and more American. 

Compared to Surly Skeleton Tree 1/7/2023: Pours darker, stronger aromas. More chocolate. Less airy roast, dark grain, and yeast. Slightly maltier and more balanced. 

Compared to Great Lakes Edmund Fitzgerald 3/2023: More English chocolate, espresso bean dark fruit. less bittersweet chocolate, dark roast, bitterness. 

Compared to Bent Paddle Black 3/2023: More English chocolate, espresso bean, dark fruit. Less milk chocolate, coffee roast. Milder. 

Overall: A nice Porter here with bittersweet English chocolate, cocoa, and roasted flavors. Drinks balanced, but leans dry as a porter should. A lower ABV and clean, yet flavorful. Nicely done and balanced all around. (Rating: 4.14)"
5637,Wattie83,Anchor Porter,4.17,"Poured from 12oz bottle to a nonic pint glass. Pours a deep, rich brown with a decent dark khaki head that settled to a cap. Beer is opaque. Smell is roasted malt, caramel, and chocolate. Also there's a bit of hop aroma too. Taste had cocoa, coffee, roasted barley, generic fruitiness in the finish. Feel is medium bodied, well-carbonated. Overall, this is a really nice porter with a strong hop presence, yet it still remains rather well- balanced."
5638,Hooded,Anchor Porter,4.72,"Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass.
The body is inky black with a half inch of brown head with a mild pour. Retention is average.
The intensity of aroma is medium. There are notes of malt, salted toffee, rich dark chocolate and black coffee. It smells wonderful. 
The intensity of taste is medium high with a dryer and more hoppy flavor than the aroma suggests. Normally, I loath hoppy porters, but Anchor got this one right. With a swallow, the flavor keeps going. There are flavors of toffee, deep dark chocolate, more black coffee than in the aroma and a long pronounced hoppy flavor that's medium in intensity. It's rich and delicious. I've missed having a go to dark beer after New Castle changed. This will likely be it's much better replacement. I usually support local Austin breweries, but this is a much better beer than 512 Pecan Porter which is much more expensive for a four-pack compared to a six-pack of this.
The thickness is just under medium. It's quite dry with a low level of astringency. Well, I finished the bottle before I could accurately detect the level of creaminess. With it's 5.6% ABV, I'm feeling a little numbness in my face. I will open another bottle tomorrow to finish this. 
The level of creaminess is high. The carbonation is unique. The bubbles are tiny and tickle the tongue creating a effervescent quality. It has a lot of world class qualities in the mouth feel alone.
Overall, I'm amazed by how excellent this is. After trying a few beers that I didn't care for, Anchor Porter reminded me how truly great a beer can be."

5644,tolar111,Samuel Adams Old Fezziwig Ale,3.88,"The look is a nice translucent reddish brown with a fluffy off-white head that quickly fades to a ring of foam around the top of the glass. The smell is faint, with an aroma of roasted malts and spices. The taste is of roasted malts, but I'm not picking up sweet toffee, as the label suggests. but there is a nice bitterness. There is a flavor component that lays thick on the tongue and I'm assuming it's the spices, whatever they are. The feel is great, just enough carbonation to spread the aroma and flavor without being over carbonated. This is my first go round with this beer and I like it, tasty and satisfying, but I don't know if I'd drink than more than one or two in a session, given the way the taste/aftertaste sticks around"
5645,sulldaddy,Samuel Adams Old Fezziwig Ale,3.83,"Sampling a 12 oz bottle picked up as a single recently for the Holiday Ales tasting event. Best before April on the notching system on the label.
Im pouring the bottle at cellar temperature into my Westmalle Chalice.
The beer pours a bright chestnut color with some rich ruby highlights, looks nice in the glass with light behind it. A short lived fizzy beige head of about .5cm foams up , this is completely gone after a few minutes. 
Aroma on the beer is a bit of toffee, some light fruitiness (cherry?) and mild general spice, Id say nutmeg if forced to pick one, but its not a bold nose. No hop character and ABV totally hidden on the aroma.
First sip reveals a medium body with fine fairly gentle carbonation. Texture is smooth and this beer drinks pretty easy for the physical traits.
Flavor is some toffee again, a bit of a fruity note and some sweeter spice here. Difference is I do get some balancing hops that linger just a little after each swallow. In general its a very drinkable beer, not overly robust on nose or flavor, but certainly not flawed, Id enjoy this at a holiday setting, where I wasnt really thinking about the beers I was drinking."
5646,Cholla,Samuel Adams Old Fezziwig Ale,5,A very smooth and rich blend. Slight spice flavor that’s very easy on the palate. A nice holiday ale. Very enjoyable and very crushable. I recommend it. Cheers!
5647,Historiker,Samuel Adams Old Fezziwig Ale,3.58,"Brilliantly clear copper/ruby color. Brief Khaki head that dissipated to nothing quite fast. Minimal lacing.

Nose is barley, malts, brown bread, faint cherry, maybe some tea. A bit atypical when compared to the standard winter warmers like Great Lakes, but still nice.

Compared to the Fezziwig I had about 5 years ago, the taste is somewhat disappointing. I was hoping for the bold & sweet brew that I so enjoyed, and this isn't the same thing. This time around, there's caramel, malts, semi-tart cherry, slight sweetness & slight hoppy bitterness - good balance. Its not a bad beer, but it's also not the delightfully sweet brew that SA released before.

Mouthfeel is medium, carbonation is higher than I expected, but not bad.

Overall, while this is a fine beer, the ""rich & spiced"" description on the label just isn't accurate. I bought 2 singles, but I'd have been fine with one."

Taste follows with roasted barley up front with a very nice balance of malt sweetness; small amount of hop spice and rye bread. Sweetness lingers on the palate. Mouthfeel is on the light and crisp side which helps this from becoming cloying. Not as ""rich & spiced"" as the label advertises, but I'm fine with subtlety.

- smell is a bit muted for what the style is supposed to be; could be me, though, I picked the wrong glass - there are some good malty notes with some spice, sort of rustic, but I'm not getting a ton of cinnamon or other similar. I get some raisin and some syrupy sweetness after it opens up a bit

Name: Rubaeus
Brewery: Founders
Location: Grand Rapids, MI
Style: Fruit Beer
A.B.V. 5.7%
Date: 13 July 2023
I am drinking Rubaeus today using a tulip glass. I served it at 44 degrees. The pour created an airy, foamy, one-fingered, light-pink head with above-average retention. The color is red and pinkish. The beer is opaque. The dissipation left no lacing on the glass. The appearance is average for this style. 
The aromas are raspberries, light biscuit malts, tender grass, and fruity sweetness. The aromas are simple and straightforward, with lots of tart raspberries. 
The flavors are tart raspberries, floral esters, earthiness, grassy, fruity sweetness, crackers, and lightly toasted malts, 
The mouthfeel is tart and finishes crisp. The body is light with medium-high carbonation. 
This is a simple, straightforward beer with loads of raspberry flavors. Easy sipper on a breezy summer night. I have consumed this on nitro; this is one of the few beers that benefits from it. Nitro tames the tartness and gives the beer a creamy raspberry finish."
5668,mushroomcloud,Rübæus,3.81,"12oz bottled 8-8-23, opened 12-30-23.
2 finger off white head with a pink tinge, very good retention. Beautiful red-pink color with great clarity. 
Red fruit and a light malt backbone in the aroma. 
Tart raspberry with a little bit of sweet and (light) sour flavor. 
Light body and easy to drink with a mostly dry finish. One dimensional but a good dimension. 
Very Good."
5669,MonDak_Joe1953,Rübæus,4.09,"12oz bottle. Label has information of 'BOTTLED ON: 06.08.23'.
Mostly clear, raspberry red colored body. One finger of pinkish head, which then retreats to a partial cap and ring. Leaves behind a partial ring and scattered lacing spots.
Aroma is big with raspberry. Is there a tang from the wheat malt?
Taste is quite sweet from the flavor of raspberry preserves. Again the wheat malt tanginess is not readily apparent, but there is a tart aspect. The raspberry jam lingers in the aftertaste.
Medium mouth feel, with a nectar texture. Noticeable tongue sting. Good carbonation.
A tribute to the raspberry fruit, and an appropriate beer choice for the last day of summer."
5670,tyden46,Rübæus,3.69,"A nice brew, certainly tart and fruity but with a hint of bile or vomit (butyric acid?) that turned me off a little"
5671,JohnniEMc,Rübæus,4.17,"Now, two twelve ounce brown bottles have been emptied into a clear glass liter mug. It was a foamy pour. There's just way too much just-off-white and pinkish tinted foam to make this a pretty pour. Just as the norm, this foam recedes unevenly and unattractively. Only in this case, it's a slow process. The color of the liquid body beneath all the foam is something in the dark copper-amber or light mahogany category. It will leave irregular glass lacing. As ugly as it looks, there is a nice raspberry/malt aroma that makes this appealing. It's opaque without being murky. The taste is a very nice delivery of raspberry within a brew that includes some hops, yeast and even a little malt. It's sweet, but not bothersomely so, with a finish that bitters and drys things out. The mouthfeel is surprisingly wonderful, considering all the initial foam. With the hop bite finish, this may drink more like a raspberry AIPA than a fruited sour. Its body is also better than most fruited sours and more like a nice AIPA. Whatever, if you like a good dose of raspberry in your brew, this is a good option."
5672,klarcbarr3,Rübæus,4.24,"The beer looks beautiful. A light clear red, with a one inch white head emerges in a pint glass. The nose is all raspberry... semi-sweet, with a bit more sour. The taste, once again... all raspberry, sweet and sour a bit more balanced on the taste vs. the nose. The mouthfeel is good, balanced nicely between sticky and watery, but a bit cloying and dry on the aftertaste, which in this case, is not a bad thing... it emulates actual raspberries. Overall, I'm impressed. If I were to design a beer to taste like a robust raspberry brew, I would want it to turn out like this. Damn good beer!"
5673,BiologyBob,Rübæus,4.37,"It smell like a raspberry. That is a very good thing. The head is thin and white, and the ale looks pink with bits of raspberry in it. It is a bit sweeter on the flavor, as I favor sour in a fruity ale, but it is not too sweet."
5674,WoodBrew,Rübæus,4.21,I got a bottle of this beer of this beer from a Christmas gift basket that my Sis ans BRAH-in-law bought for me. It poured a clear pinkish amber with thin white ring head that is not leaving any lace. The scent had beautiful Raspberry notes. The taste was nicely balanced and easy to drink with tart berry presence. The mouthfeel was medium in body and had good carbonation. Overall it is a great beer.
5675,xmanden,Rübæus,3.75,Smells very raspberry and fruity. Taste like sweet and tart raspberry with a nice balance between the sweet and tart. There’s a slight yeast taste in the finish. This is more like a cider than a beer but not bad.
5676,GuyFawkes,Samuel Adams Latitude 48 IPA,2.24,"Medium orange hue; very see-through. Obviously filtered. 

Noticeable bitterness & hop aroma in the nose. 

Nice white head, good lacing throughout. 

As for the taste...where did the hops go?! They're in the nose but vanish on the tongue. Tastes very much like a lager to me. This has 3 months left on it's 'best before' date, so can't blame it on age. 

Watery, with no discernable flavor. A touch of bitterness on the back end, but hardly noticeable. After an interesting nose, this macro falls way flat."
5677,elNopalero,IPA,3.5,"Can says to enjoy before two weeks from now. No idea if that means this is three months old or longer. 
Pours like I mean it, leaving a nice cap of foam topping a light caramel colored beer. Low aroma, one I’m straining to find, with a faded citrus and pine hop profile. It seems like something I’d find 20 years ago, maybe longer."

5680,Gmann,IPA,3.78,"Pours a toasted golden color with a big rocky off-white head. Some soapy lacing on the glass.

A mix of floral and piney hops in the aroma. A little bit of bud and perhaps mint. Bright.

A light toasted malt. A bit heavier than most IPAs. The hops are earthy with light pine notes.

The malt is a beefy on the palate. Fairly balanced but finishes with a earthy bitterness.

Misses the mark on style. More of a hoppy APA. The malt is quite substantial. Its good though."
5681,ATL6245,IPA,4.57,"Appearance: Slightly hazy amber. Big fluffy white head with good retention. Fast rising bubbles.

Aroma: Citrus, pine and grassy.

Flavor: Citrus, pine and grassy. Medium to low sweetness. Moderate bitterness.

Mouthfeel: Low Astringency, soft on the palate by finishes dry. Moderate length finish.

Overall: An iconic IPA out of GA. Initial aromas are of citrus (grapefruit-like) and pine; however, as it warms and aerates, you begin to pick up additional aromas, of which fresh cut grass was most noticeable. The tastes are just as complex. You get a nice malty sweetness intermixed with citrus, pine and herbs. None of which are powerful or offensive. It finishes semi-dry with a short, eloquent bitterness. Perfectly balanced and harmonized. Nothing boring or harsh in this IPA start to finish. One of my favorites."

5687,feloniousmonk,75 Minute IPA,4.1,"Clear, bright amber coloring, beautiful bone white head, lasting long, looking lovely.

Aroma: Ah! Citrus and pine aplenty. Gorgeous. A little tropical fruit, melon and pineapple in this nose. Orange and lime, too. Ah, I say again.

Taste: Boom! Just what we want from an IPA, but creamy and smooth and just delightful. Bittersweet notes blast the palate, followed by malty sweetness. None too caustic, this IPA, it's smooth and palatable as can be.

I peeked at the label. Maple syrup? Not getting that yet. Huh.

Hop bitterness is restrained, but enjoyable. Delicious. Tasty. I'm loving it. I'm liking this so much, it's time to find out more about it. Okay, so….""A bottle conditioned India Pale Ale with maple syrup."" 7.5% ABV. There are some situations when 90 is too much. There are other situations when 60 is too little. There are many situations when 75 is just right. Bottle-conditioned with pure maple syrup for complexity and dry-hopped out the bejeezum boards."""
5688,MonDak_Joe1953,75 Minute IPA,4.14,"12oz bottle. Unfortunately I did not check the bottling date, which is '10/29/19', which makes the beer about eleven months in the bottle. I picked this up out of the store's cooler, and didn't think I needed to date check. Anyways . . . 
Cloudy, deep gold colored body. One finger of lingering white, pillowy head. Not much left on the glass for lacing.
Aroma is grassy and muddy hops, with a sweet note from the maple syrup. Solid malt background.
Taste is grassy and piney hops, with a sweet note. Approaching a bitter note but not quite. Smooth trail off into the after taste. Allowing the beer to sit on the tongue really brings out the maple and hop combination.
Mouth feel is the best attribute of the beer, with dense coating and filling of the mouth. Very good carbonation.
I will try to try this again with a younger bottling date, but this is still a very good hoppy, but sweet, concoction."
5689,Hmmmmm,Hopsecutioner,3.73,"I liked this more than I thought I would at first sip, but I've known to give them a chance.

Towards the end of the can, I like it. It's a deep stouty flavor. Not quite a skull splitter at 12% but it's still a bold 7 something.

I like it.

Comes off vinegary at first, but mad drinkable towards the end."

5691,GaryPro,Hopsecutioner,2.63,"Cool name, cool artwork, taste doesn’t do it for me. I’d never turn down if offered, but won’t buy unless clearance priced. I need to try more Terrapin beers in order to give a fair shot to brewery."
5692,Victory_Sabre1973,Hopsecutioner,4.08,"In a can BBD 9-28-23, so a bit past it's BBD. I've had this beer once before, on tap and fresh, back in 2015. This was before I joined BA. 

This beer is a very clear pouring beer, and dark golden in color, with amber hues. The head that forms is 2 finger, white, and quite fluffy/frothy looking. The head retentiion is quite good, and there's a bit of lacing on the glass. 
Even though this can is past it's BBD, it still is so full of hops. I get a lot of pine and a good deal of evergreen tree smell from the hops. I have had this beer a long time ago, fresh, and on tap. I don't remember the smell, though I remember it was very strong. I would love to smell it again fresh sometime, and see if it's stronger. 
Taste - The taste is full on pine and evergreen tree flavor. The hops seem somewhat muted, but they're still quite strong. 
The body is quite full. The bitterness does last, though, I would think it could last longer fresh. 
I really have to try this yet again fresh sometime. I really enjoyed it, but I think it's fallen off a bit with age. Solid beer overall, and a treat."

5694,StonedTrippin,Hopsecutioner,3.94,"one of those beers of fame that i somehow have not had until now, a draft pour, an iconic beer, but it probably meant more when its peer group was smaller. the first thing ive had from terrapin in way too long, nice beer, but in some ways it has a ton of equals now, everyone caught up perhaps. looks like they used to, lightly brassy to copper, mostly clear with some low shine, a fine almost inch of thick and lasting white head, craggy and rocky and leaving lace as it drinks. it smells like minerals from the malt, a little crystal malt richness, but still american, tons of relatively fresh hops wrapped into it, grapefruit for sure, could be simcoe driven, spicy northwestern vibes too, orange zest, cantaloupe, and pine, its resinous and it seems to be bitter, but its not overly intense as they go, at least by todays standards, classically balanced and without anything from the yeast. the flavor is similar, grapefruit for sure, white pine boards, tangerine, herbal bitters, and actual high alpha hop bitterness set against, or rather alongside and together with, slightly nutty pale barley malt, sweet like toffee but for just a flash in the middle, then bready and baked and in a support role. this is really nice, fresh in this instance, and with some linger. it plays in that iconic space, lagunitas ipa and the like, drinkable for its strength and because its got great proportionality, but it also didnt hit me in this day and age as something real special either, good but just an ipa, not being critical, it just seems familiar. good to get to drink some terrapin stuff, i always forget they have corporate ownership now..."
5695,mfnmbvp,Hopsecutioner,3.88,"12 oz. can, best by DEC 07, 2023. Acquired the 6 pack from the Janesville, Wisconsin Woodman's. Ironic how beer brewed in Georgia is available in Wisconsin, yet I never see it in Illinois, but I digress.

A: Pours a nice burnt golden / orange, strong finger point five of frothy sudsy off-white head. Looks float-ish. Color is nice, reminiscent of how they used to make IPA's...
S: Earthy, twiggy, grassy. Not overly hoppy or piney or resinous, despite the six hop varieties that went into this. Notes of caramel & bready biscuit malt.
T: The taste is nice, but surely not designed to break or crash any new ground. Bitter, slightly piney, good balance of bread malts. It's simple but nice.
F: Decent feel. Smooth, creamy. Body feels super light, especially for being over 7% abv, with the alcohol being not noticeable at all.

Overall, I would call it slightly above average, but definitely decent, especially in these days where Hazy swill lines all the shelves.

Overall: WC style IPA. Lands with a compliment of citrus, herbal and piney aromas and flavors. Pretty aggressive bitterness that is coating and lasts well into the finish. Uses Warrior, Chinook, Simcoe, Centennial and Cascade hops."

Overall - Hoppy, malty backbone, caramel sweetness and fruity. Mouthfeel is a bit light. There's a piney resin and fruity candy flavor on the finish. Great job by Terrapin using six different hops to create a solid west coast IPA. That's why I paired Hopsecutioner with Going Back to Cali by Sevendust. Heavy duty!"

Aroma: Pine tar, the kind you'd put on a baseball bat. Some sweet notes of granola and orange peel in the background. A little bit of lemon peel and pickled ginger.

Taste: Decently bitter but not to a gobsmacking degree. Follows the nose. Good amount of pine resin and bitter orange upfront, followed by chewy notes of caramel and granola. Ends on more spicy pine resin with just the slightest hint of orange taffy. 

Feel: Mid-Heavy body. Somewhat chewy and thick. Dry.

Overall: Solid IPA."

The aroma is very complex with roasted coffee, dark crusty bread, and burnt sugar notes being complimented with a substantial herbal and spicy hop character. The taste has more of the same with a spicy, bittersweet chocolate finish. A very unique drinking experience by todays standards with the style moving away from bitter flavors and more into sweet flavors in most examples. Too bad this one is not widely available these days, this is classic west-coast beer at its best."

Dec 30, ‘20 bottling date - 6 months old. 
Much more like an English brown porter (aside from the bitterness) than most American porters. Roasty notes are low in favor of nutty, bready malts. 
There’s also a thread of that Chico yeastiness throughout. 
What saves it is the body: light and fizzy enough to be sessionable, but with a creaminess that makes it satisfying. 

A solid beer, but get Edmund Fitzgerald for that classic American Porter profile. 

Lighter, fizzier, sweeter, nuttier, more balanced, less hoppy, cleaner, and more sessionable than Sierra Nevada Stout."

Substantial depth of flavors in a 5 % ABV ale. Very pleasant."
5707,backblast,Porter,3.71,"Nice roasty malt up front with some sweet earthiness mixed in. It has a light mouthfeel with lots of carbonation and a mild bitter end. The finish drops off quickly - too quickly actually. It really is a nice porter, but overall it's too light, could be so much more."
5708,jockstrappy,Porter,3.47,"Pours a dark coffee brown, ruby hues and a creamy tan head. Aromas are fairly muted, a roasted malt profile is there but I can’t really pick anything definitive. Flavors include roasty malt notes of coffee, raw cocoa and earthy nuttiness. Trademark SN floral hop bite makes a subtle appearance on the back end. Mild carbonation. Lingering bitterness on the palate.

It’s good for sure, not extraordinary or anything. As with any beer, freshness is everything. I would love to get some of this closer to the source to see the contrast in the flavors."

Smell: Nice chocolate smell, kind of like powdered cocoa.

Taste: Mildly sweet, continues with mildly sweetened chocolate through the body, finishes with a touch of roasty malt. Medium-light body, easy drinking.

Overall: A very nice English stout, it's good to mix in some traditional styles occasionally. Nicely balanced flavors and very drinkable. Flavorful without being overpowering. Very nice!"
5713,journey-of-beer,Organic Chocolate Stout,4.03,"Look: deep, dark brown. Almost two fingers of head that persists for quite awhile with some excellent lacing. 

Smell: very mild, much more than expected for a stout this dark. Malt, cocoa powder, and a mild but off-putting metallic aroma. 

Taste: so much better than suggested by the nose. I first notice a milk chocolate with a touch more sweetness than expected, followed by roasty malt flavor that lingers long on the palate. The sweetness is not overdone and is quite enjoyable. No hint of the metallic aroma I got in the nose. 

Feel: a bit thin and watery, but along the lines of what is expected for a fairly low ABV stout. A bit more carbonation than I would have liked. 

Overall: a true classic of its style. I’ll enjoy more in the future, and would recommend everybody try it at least once."

There is also a hint of vanilla. Malty with big chocolate flavor and light roasted malt. Vanilla and earthy hops on the back. Medium-weight body is soft and creamy with just enough carbonation to give it some edge. It’s sweet but it’s a fantastic stout."

5716,Tom-o-Bedlam,Organic Chocolate Stout,4.24,"It’s tempting to call this a candy bar in a glass, but after the initial burst of milk chocolate and vanilla, there are interesting notes of pipe tobacco, dates, and just a bit of hops."
5717,kflorence,Organic Chocolate Stout,3.56,"Pours a deep, dark brown in color with hints of amber and an excellent two finger thick foamy, off-white head on top that leaves lacing as you drink. Head retention is pretty good, it subsides but sticks around until the end. Carbonation is hard to see, though it seems average. Very pretty on the pour.

Aroma is very strongly milk chocolate, vanilla and some very faint fruity, hoppiness. It's quite sweet. I expected a bit more roasty bitterness. Based on the aroma I think they overdid the chocolate additives a bit and I'm probably in for some disappointment.

Yep. The taste follows the aroma well. Very strongly milk chocolate and some vanilla with a hint of hoppiness. It's sweet, and there isn't any roast or bitter cacao to balance it out. I find the flavor to be rather one-dimensional. I do finally get some roastiness in the aftertaste, but it's mixed with the same chocolately notes that simply overpower it.

This is medium bodied with lower than average carbonation with a tiny bit of zest on the swallow. It's honestly a bit thin for a stout. There is some syrupyness in there, and a little creaminess, but it does feel a bit thin on the swallow. The lighter nature of the mouthfeel does make it more drinkable, however.

This was disappointing for me. I expected it to be a bit more on the dark chocolate/burnt/roasty side, but it is instead more on the sweet/milk chocolate/vanilla side, and for a stout it comes off quite light on the palate. There's just too much sweet and not enough bitter to balance it out for me. Not what I want from a stout. I agree with another reviewer that this feels a bit more like a porter and in fact it reminds me a lot of a toasted coconut porter I had awhile back which I also found too sweet. This is one of the few misses from Samuel Smith for me, and judging by the rating, it's a fine beer if this is the flavor profile you're looking for. I've got three more bottles to get through, at least it's drinkable! Cheers."

5719,HOWEverSpence,Arctic Panzer Wolf,4.53,"I’m starting to believe all the hype behind 3 Floyds BC. I’ve been coming at their beers from more of a critical angle, and they still seem to beat my expectations. Honestly, I may appreciate this more than Zombie Dust, and that’s saying something."
5720,Darkmagus82,Arctic Panzer Wolf,4.41,"Poured from a can into a pint glass
Appearance – The beer pours a hazy orange-amber color with a puffy head of white foam. The head has a great level of retention, fading slowly over time and leaving lots of spiderweb lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – the aroma is quite heavy of a tropical fruit smell of papaya, passionfruit, and pineapple mixed with lots of tangerine and some aromas of honeydew and grape. Along with these smells comes notes of a light graininess and some hop smells of pine and grapefruit. A touch of earthiness and some hay round it all out, producing a quite inviting smell.
Taste – The taste begins with a bready and slightly more thick malt flavor paired with some of the tropical fruits of papaya and pineapple that were in the nose. There is also a decent showing of tangerine and orange as well as some very light lemon. The hops are present right from the start with flavors of herb and pine being the strongest, but being accompanied by a bit of grapefruit as well. As the taste advances the sweetness gets a touch stronger as a light peach and apricot taste join in. The alcohol is well hidden, but can be tasted at the end, and with some a decent earthiness, one is left with a rather robustly hopped taste to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is slightly more thick and chewy with a carbonation level that is lower than normal. For the style and the tastes, the feel is awesome, really allow you to sense all the rich flavors and appreciate the higher abv with a sipping brew.
Overall – A quite nice double with lots of flavor and bigness. Would recommend this one."
5721,ThisWangsChung,Arctic Panzer Wolf,3.81,"Pours a slightly murky copper color with about a finger's worth of head, eggshell colored and pretty rough in texture. The aroma is classic Three Floyds IPA - honeydew melon, grapefruit, mango, lemon, and passionfruit pop assertively. There isn't much malt backbone apart from a hint of caramel. There's just something so comforting about an older school, non-hazy IPA bringing this much tropical fruit aroma. The taste, thankfully, follows the nose pretty well, though the malt presence shows up a bit more boldly on the palate. Still, a huge wave of mango, lemon, grapefruit, and melon hit the palate running. Remember how I talked about the more assertive maltiness? The finish features a decent amount of caramel and toffee, as well as a touches of booze and sugar. The boozy presence is the only thing preventing me from giving the taste a 4, but it's still a good DIPA regardless. The feel is crisp and a little fuzzy, with a long finish. I don't expect creaminess from an assertive DIPA like this, though. The sugar presence is a bit more prevalent than I'd like, slowing drinkability down slightly. Carbonation is medium. Overall, I'd put this a little above Dreadnaught and a little below Permanent Funeral. It's just another rock-solid IPA in the Three Floyds arsenal of rock-solid IPAs."

5725,teromous,Arctic Panzer Wolf,3.47,"From the bottom of the can: ""PKGD ON 11/18/22 Q0711""
This was a 16oz can from a 4-pack.

Appearance: The body is nearly opaque which allows only a very faint haze of a blurry shadow through. It has a deep golden amber body which is on the darker side but not quite bronze. There is a short and fluffy white head which maintains a thin layer of fluffy film over the surface with a creamy and fluffy ring around the glass. There is some spotty lacing.

Aroma: At first some wildflower aroma came through, then some fruity peach and grapefruit came to the nose. There is a touch of cabbage but each time it becomes apparent, it pops out and is replaced by a more fruity aroma.

Taste: The flavor closely mimics the aroma here. There is this somewhat floral opening to the beer giving it a wildflower note up front which is a bit soap-like. Then it develops more citrus character on the tongue; largely this mixture of pithy grapefruit and blood orange. These two citrus notes persist to the end. It has a somewhat grassy finish. After a while some candied orange also comes through a tad.

Mouthfeel: Bitterness on this beer is high. It has a body that is on the lower edge of medium with a touch of slickness. It is a bit of a slow drinker given the high bitterness and the somewhat medium body.

Overall: The citrus notes in this beer and the strong bitterness are the highlights. There is plenty to enjoy when it comes to both of these qualities. The beer also has a floral note which is not bad but when combined with the grassy character it clashes with the more citrus-centric notes of the beer. It's an alright beer but I'm not likely to buy it again over what is readily available on the market. The beer I purchased was consumed within 3 months of being canned so I might try it again if it was on tap or if it was fresher than the one I purchased. I wouldn't advocate for or against it, but I would recommend a single can or a sampler before buying a 4-pack."

F: Bitter and astringent, as it’s supposed to be.
O: A full-on west coast IPA at only 4.7%. It’s technically very accomplished but the mouthfeel still suffers and I’m not convinced that a beer this bitter will ever be truly sessionable, regardless of its ABV."
5732,Sigmund,Go To IPA,3.88,"330 ml can, brewed in Berlin. ABV is 4.7%. Bought at Gulating Ølutsalg, Stavanger. Hazy golden colour, small white head. Aroma of citrus and tropical fruits, a hint of dill. Hoppy and citrussy flavour, slightly sweet, also notes of tropical fruits and pine needles. Bitter finish. Good beer."
5733,MrOH,Go To IPA,3.96,"Clear gold, great white head, awesome retention and lace
Pine, orange zest, and light dank
Light orange and pine, a little bit of sweet malt, but kinda thin tasting
Light bodied and good carbonation
I feel that this would be a good beer for outside around the grill in the summer, not just getting in from walking the dog in the winter. I'd probably like it better then. Tried my best to be objective"
5734,brewerburgundy,Go To IPA,4.03,"12oz bottle, tulip, bottled on 10/22/20. 

Light gold yellow, big fluffy head with great retention. 

Nectarine, lemon, tangerine. Impressively aromatic with lots of delicate fruit. 

Two row, gritty bitterness that’s really great for a session IPA, and lots of fruitiness. Lychee, tangerine, white grape, stone fruit. 

Light body, dry finish, impressive bitterness. 

In the running for best session IPA I’ve had. Hop aroma and flavor are all there, including significant bitterness and great drying, bitter finish not usually seen in the sub-style."
5735,RyanK252,Go To IPA,3.73,"A: Pours crystal clear golden amber with a frothy off white head that settles to a light layer and leaves a little nice lacing. 

S: Zesty citrus, mostly lemon and grapefruit, grassy, resinous pine, and crackery malt. 

T: Citrus zest, grapefruit and lemon,a little tangerine and lime, grassy, resinous pine, subtle fruity notes, passion fruit, peach, apricot, and mango, crackery malt, pretty much bone dry finish. 

M: Light body, moderately lively carbonation. 

O: Haven't had this one since it was first released, before I was on BA, so it's nice to get to try it again. Takes me back to when session IPAs were the new toy on the shelf. To its credit, this one is bright and crisp, and would definitely do the job as a lawnmower beer. That said, it does have a bit of the trademark session IPA watery-ness, and there are other session IPAs out there with a bit more balance and flavor. Wouldn't turn it down, but wouldn't be my ""go to""."
5736,feloniousmonk,Go To IPA,3.93,"Appearance: Lightly hazy, bright golden hue, slim white head.

Aroma: As advertised, very vibrant and utterly bursting with hops. Bold and bright citrus and pine. Ah, so nice.

Taste: More of that big, fierce and shining hop flavor, with just enough juicy malt below. Lean bodied, with a dominant buzz of hop bitterness. Drinkable, yes, also refreshing and tasty, too. It's good beer, and I can drink it, but…just doesn't thrill me. I really don't desire the session IPA. I like the regular ones just fine, thank you very much. Faced with the choice of this or a regular Stone IPA, I know where I'm going.

This one is merely ""okay"", and that's not what I expect out of Stone. Low on my priorities."
5737,Dr_Gonzo,Go To IPA,4,"Poured into a tall clear pint glass. Clear, bright golden color, with a finger or so of creamy white head. Good retention and lacing.

Getting a lot of citrus notes in the aroma. Orange, lemon, and lime zest, along with the fruits themselves, some biscuity malt, mango, and a strong smell of pineapple.

Tasting primarily the citrus zest and rinds too. Nicely bitter hops, some pine and resin added in the flavor, along with the biscuity malt. Can't say that this beer tastes sweet however. Body is medium light."
5738,ResearchRado,Pranqster,3.73,"Appearance:
Clear light golden color. No head or lacing. 

Aroma:
Sweet melons. Floral. 

Taste:
Honeyed peaches. Banana. Wheat. 

Mouthfeel:
Smooth. Mild viscosity. Lightly effervescent. Nice. 

Overall: 
Good stuff. Real drinkable liquid, especially at 7.6%. 
Not sure if it’s a sipper or a slammer. Kinda sweet floral flavors like a cider."
5739,solok,Pranqster,3.49,Orange color. Weak head. Smells almost of apple juice. Taste is fairly sweet and mild. Fruity. No spice. Limited hop bitterness. Almost flat feel. basic and unremarkable for a Belgian strong pale.
5740,Nass,Pranqster,4,"The pour is a cloudy golden color. The taste is orange, banana, along with some mild spice notes. There is no date on the bottle. This was a good Belgian Pale Ale. Cheers! A-"
5741,AlvinBunk,Pranqster,4.61,"Pours clear and light golden with very nice head and light lacing.
Absolutely awesome flowery and citrus like aromas which are very strong.
Sweet and light sour notes but overall extremely pleasant. Almost like rose water and possibly honey; it's a very unique taste in beer.
Medium thinkness in the mouth and very easy drinking.

Overall a really wonderful beer!"
5742,TurboMon_911,Pranqster,4.21,"Poured a hazy golden straw color into a Samuel Smith Imperial pint glass: with a finger high white foamy head that dissipates quickly to a thin ring along the side of the glass, with minimal lacing and constant visible carbonation from start to finish. Aroma of Belgian esters, bread, malt and stone fruit from yeast abound. Taste follows nose with esters, light phenols, stone fruit, straw, honey & wheat. Mouth is medium with slight bitterness and dry finish but dominated by the spiciness of the Belgian yeast and wheat. A very enjoyable brew that has good complexity, structure and is very drinkable."
5743,TimInPA,Pranqster,4.71,What a great surprise this beer turned out to be. I love Belgian triples and wanted something lower on the ABV scale that had an easy drinkability quality to it. This one is great. This is right up there with Brugge Zot for an easy going beer in the summer.
5744,ivanbrew,Pranqster,5,I have tried this beer out of a bottle at the same one on the picture Before the really light had a nice Sweet citrusy aroma And the flavor was kind of like a Belgian triple also sweet with a citrusy flavor finish
5745,TerryMills,Pranqster,4.17,"Very solid blue has the usual Belgian / Farmhouse funk but is also very drinkable and smooth at the same time, this is a great beer to get into Belgian beers."
5746,milkshakebeersucks,Pranqster,4.14,"Appearance: Cloudy, deep gold body, average size white head, modest lacing.
Aroma: Soft, orchard fruit. earthy yeastiness, slightly sweet maltiness.
Taste: Floral, spicy, fruity hop footprint. Malts and yeast add depth and intensity.
Mouthfeel: Medium-to-full bodied with good carbonation.
Overall: Totally enjoyable."
5747,Blogjackets,Pranqster,4.1,"Poured from a twelve ounce bottle, a fast fading initial head and modest lacing. The body pours a cloudy blond color. 

Taste and nose are super fruity with a delightful honey flavor and some banana. Yeast and bread notes are secondary but present. On the sweet side but not cloying. No sign of ABV. 

Good mouthfeel and carbonation, this beer is smooth drinking. Not as dry, complex or strong as Duvel, but an enjoyable beer."
5748,rxmk,Pranqster,4.51,Excellent blonde. A little too thin on finish.
5749,JuliusBonsall,Purple Haze,3.57,"So I’m (etch-a-)sketching my next inner thigh tattoo, a bottomless Kathy Bates coiled around one of those Ginsu knives you buy off the TV at 3am when you definitely haven’t been watching scrambled porn on your mom’s Prism cable—been working on it for weeks—when my best mate Gordon Blevins informs me she’s still alive. Unstinkable Molly Brown indeed. Do I go through with it? Seems like a matter that can only be settled by sucking down the Purple Haze I’d decanted into a spent Capri Sun pouch to sneak it into my god-grandniece’s custody hearing. Gordon argues that the antemortem homage is probably my best shot at ever winning the romantic favor of Mama Boucher. He has my attention with a comprehensive social media campaign, an Omaha Steaks homepage takeover, and a 30-second nationwide radio spot. Gordon’s presentation is riveting. Like a recently-dismissed TGI Friday’s dishwasher moonlighting as Don Draper. He gets himself entirely too worked up and vomits all over his laptop, which is ruined, taking with it the meticulous plan he’d only thought to save on the desktop. I shrug, instantly rededicated to a life of idle cranking. Hogwise. Resigned, I sip.

I’m flesh made milk. I’m 7 years old again, again. I smell sound. I’m Filipino and my name’s Cevin (with a hard C). Guess I didn’t rinse the acid out of my Capri carry-all adequately. There’s a hint of actual berries gently lapping at the edges of my perception, which is itself a mirage — thanks again, hallucinogens. Maybe a Vanguard hop slipping a finger somewhere untoward? The mouthfeel is math and the smell is Roanoke, Virginia. 

Quick update on my way to get the old stomach pumped (turns out it was actually bleach residue in my Capri) — my god-grandniece decided to get her own place, seeing as she’s 37 and all. She deserves it."
5750,blitzkreg,Purple Haze,2.34,Did not taste any of the raspberry. Tastes like cheap beer. Good that I didn't buy a whole pack.
5751,Death_Adder,Purple Haze,5,"Has a subtle sweet and tart raspberry flavor and one of the most delightful smelling aromas I’ve ever experienced. I first had this beer back in 2005, and it smells and tastes exactly like it did back then, absolutely delicious. While the taste is great, Purple Haze’s downfall comes in its low abv and high ticket price, so it’s a special occasion only beer. I also haven’t seen it in bottles in my area in a long time, at 13 dollars for a 6pk, there really should be a bottle option available.

Style: Fruit Beer | Tap/Can/Bottle: Can | Abv: 4.2% | Rating: 5"
5752,JiveTurkeyJim,Purple Haze,3.03,It was okay. Raspberry taste is a little too strong. I honestly expected more. I don't know why.
5753,calvin_os,Purple Haze,3.71,"Super solid, I'm a fan of these fruited beers. Not too sweet."
5754,mooseisloose,Purple Haze,3.69,Love their TurboDog. Picked up a couple of sixers of this on sale for $6.29 at ABC. Lets give it a whirl. Popping the top I get faint malt wafts. Pours to a deep orange with a creamy off-white head that stands well. Taste is a nice raspberry pop up front then transitions into a malty middle then the bitterness builds in the end and leaves a clingy bitter aftertaste. Not sweet but more tart and bitter at the same time. A good fruity beer for those who still want some nice bitter hopping. I like the fact that it is not sweet and doesn't finish sweet.
5755,MadMadMike,Purple Haze,3.24,"12 ounce well chilt bottle, straight up.
Smells like berries, but not in a lambic way. Boones Farm -ish.
Taste is a bit tart. The pilsner and wheat malts along with Vanguard hops give balance. Aftertaste is sweetly floral.,. nothing memorable here.,0
Thin, medium carb.
Overall, next time I got my gold & purple beads on, I’ll grab one of these little fruity lagers.,."
5756,dacrza1,Purple Haze,3.08,"DATE: April 14, 2023... OCCASION: watching A Sort of Homecoming with Shan and a beer I hadn't had in a long time.. GLASSWARE: Sam Adams custom lager... a hazy, dirty yellow body streams tiny bubbles upward into an off-white ring... the opening scents are metallic hops, raspberry, blueberry, Smarties chalk, and a strange, funky/yeasty annoyance that nonetheless gives it a unique, memorable aroma... slick, oily, watery--yet refreshingly so... some low-end effervescence at the throat... the strawberry and blueberry are punchy, bright and sweetly interwoven with its bready malts.... at 4% and change, crushable and embracing in its friendship... tough to argue with its effect, it might not be one worthy of an up-close profile, but it will win in the right context or gathering... a nice accompaniment for a warm spring night like this..."
5757,Shiredave,Purple Haze,3.41,"Ok so it;s sorta pink - ish in color if back lit.
It's got a mild raspberry aroma under the malt. 
Hops may or may not have been used in the latter part of the boil. 
Most likely not but... maybe.
The flavor is light raspberry ale with a bit of actual malt sweetness to give it some ( not much ) body.
Finish is dry with a tart hint of red berry."
5758,DCH,Dortmunder Gold,4.73,"This is not only one of the best examples of the style but one of the best beers I’ve had in some time. Appearance is a transparent light gold/amber color, with a 1 inch head that sticks around. Smell is of barley and faint honey, taste is the same as smell with a slick taste of honey mixed with a hop bite. The only flaw I could find is maybe the hop bitterness is slightly too high, similar to what I get from a Brooklyn lager (totally different style) but not as severe as that. Overall a delicious beer, very glad I tried it."
5759,dd53grif,Dortmunder Gold,4.1,Pours a gold color with a foamy white head that lasts quite a while. Aroma of lightly roasted malts. Taste is peppery with floral notes. Slightly bitter at the finish.
5760,ElijahLep,Dortmunder Gold,4.76,Amazing lager. Really nice wheaty taste and smell. My favorite lager of all time by far and one of my favorites from Great Lakes.
5761,Brook82,Dortmunder Gold,3.96,"Got a pint on tap. Honey gold color, a bit hazy with moderate carbonation. Mild aroma, smooth easy drinking, well balanced. Good beer and would not hesitate to purchase again."
5762,AGU313,Dortmunder Gold,4.36,"A: beautiful bronze, sexy orange- tiny head, tiny bubbles, crystal clear

S: sweet and floral and fruity, biscuity, 

T: balanced hops, simple and legible

M: smooth and gently carbonated

O: crushable easy drinking"
5763,bluejacket74,Dortmunder Gold,4.17,"12 ounce can, best before date of 11/14/23 stamped on the bottom of the can. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear amber color with about an inch and a half off-white frothy head that stuck around a long time. Good amount of lacing. I like the aroma, the brew smells like toasted malt, caramel, and some spicy/earthy hops. Taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but there's also some grainy malt and earthy hop flavors noticeable too. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's smooth, slick and easy to drink with a good amount of carbonation. A pretty good overall Dortmunder style brew, not the first time I've had this so I'm really not sure why I haven't reviewed it until now. Always a good choice and try this one if you're into Dortmunders!"
5764,ClevelandCowboy,Dortmunder Gold,4.06,"My first review had to be a Cleveland classic! Served in a plastic cup at Progressive Field

L: Deep Gold with a thin white head.
S: Complex toasty malt with an almost ""dusty"" note, something akin to peanut shells. Faintest bit of crisp hops on the end.
T: Nice carbonation that isn't overwhelming at the tip of my tongue. As it moves towards the back of my mouth I go from bright hops that aren't too bitter to that nice toasty malt that I got on the nose.
F: Very nice feel for a lager, almost thick in comparison to beers of similar styles.

Overall this is a wonderful step up from the standard domestic lager and it's easy to see why it's a local favorite that's even gained national recognition"
5765,TwilightBeerCareer,Dortmunder Gold,4,"Poured from a can. Clear golden color with an ample fluffy white head. Head dissipated to a layer of film in a couple of minutes. Taste starts out sweet and malty, but finishes bitter. Well done Dortmunder Lager."
5766,sulldaddy,Dortmunder Gold,4.38,"Sampling a 12 oz bottle poured into my .5L dimple mug at cellar temp. 6/17/2023 date stamp on the label.
The beer pours a clear copper color with a few lazy streams of carbonation rising to the surface. There is a foaming soft eggshell white head of 2 cm. This foam fades quickly to a thin edge layer and leaves very scattered lattice when I take a sip or swirl the mug.
Aroma is a big of caramel and toasted bread with hints of biscuit as well. I do get some spicy hops and maybe tea note as well. Overall the nose is kind of mild but also complex. 
First sip reveals a light to medium body with smooth texture and gentle carbonation. Very easy drinker as would be expected for the beer and this style.
Flavor is toasted grains and biscuity malt with some spicy hop and black tea again, this lingers briefly after the swallow.
A nice easy drinking yet flavorful beer. Glad to have finally posted this review!"
5767,davidward,A Little Sumpin' Wild,4,A wickedly balanced IPA loaded with hoppy goodness.
5768,SmellypoopooheaD,A Little Sumpin' Wild,4.65,The beer that made me fall in love with craft beer. So sad it's been discontinued but always hoping for a rebirth
5769,Buckeye55,A Little Sumpin' Wild,4,"Pours a clear reddish-brown color with little head. Scent is of citrus and hops, with the taste surprisingly bitter. Light-medium mouthfeel and an aftertaste dominated by bitter hops"
5770,JCP_II,Troegenator,4.27,"Thin head, no lacing to speak of. Nose is caramel malt and stone fruit, taste follows. Medium mouth feel, smooth and creamy. Consistent and delicious, just sweet enough!"
5771,dofo777,Troegenator,4.03,"Not too bitter, maybe a little sweet, lots of fig/date vibes, very enjoyable. Deep brown,amber color, minimal head, if fog newtons were a beer... Nice to sip while reading, not very distracting, but like oh, hi, right, you taste good."
5772,stonelis,Troegenator,4.15,Good malt flavor. Not too sweet. Holds it's own against it's German competition. One of my go to Doppelbocks. Great beer overall.
5773,Roxchambeau,Troegenator,4.42,"Pours reddish-brown. Clear. Small head turns to a ring. No lacing. The nose is beautiful - sweet, fruity, like a Belgian ale. Taste follows with caramel and dates. Medium body, low carbonation. Fantastic - one of very few brews that I keep going back to."
5774,LiquidAmber,Troegenator,4.06,"Poured into a Celebrator pokal. Pours a medium to dark reddish orange with a quarter finger light khaki head that dissipates to a thin cap with light lacing. Aroma of biscuit malt, dates, dry caramel and vanilla, interesting. Flavor is biscuit and dry caramel malt, dates, pumpernickel bread, toffee, raisins and a hint of vanilla; finishes drier with a mild hop bitterness. Medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess. A pleasant doppelbock that finishes a little drier than the continental ones. The basic malt is classic doppelbock, perhaps a bit less sweet and an interesting rye-like drier finish. I'm glad to have such a pleasant introduction to this legendary brewery. Wish there were more doppelbocks on the market."
5775,FrankWithers,Troegenator,3.8,"Malty background yes, but not overwhelmingly so. Forward sweetness. Not recommended on an empty stomach."
5776,Joebull,Troegenator,4.2,"This is my go-to beer year round when I'm not looking to try anything new. Its just the perfect all around beer for my taste, and it doesn't take too many to get the job done. Consistent quality, however if you happen to catch some Troegenator's while they're fresh, definitely do it."
5777,DefenCorps,Shakespeare Oatmeal Stout,4.02,"Nitro can

Black with a creamy, cascaded beige head with good retention and lacing. The nose is bitter, roasty, creamy, hoppy, with the black barley clearly present. Mild dark chocolate, chicory notes. The palate opens bitter and clean, with a silky dark chocolate and Madras coffee character. Mild chicory. Bitterness is a little more reserved then on tap. Smooth, creamy, bitter finish. Soft and nice oatmeal flavor. Tasty."
5778,Singlefinpin,Shakespeare Oatmeal Stout,4,"Drinking this at home.
Poured from a can into a pint glass.
Looks dark brown almost black with a nice foamy tannish head.
Smells malty, sweet, chocolate, coffee.
Mouth feel is medium for the style.
Overall a nice stout that I would definitely drink again."
5779,Sigmund,Shakespeare Oatmeal Stout,3.99,"RBESG 2006 Grand Tasting. Pitch black colour, low tan head. Very nice roasty and hoppy aroma, some sweetish bakery notes in the background. Nice roasty flavour, not overdone, notes of good coffee, hints of dark chocolate. A very good stout in my book."
5780,dunkel_weizen,Shakespeare Oatmeal Stout,4.4,"On tap at Rogue in Newport. The color is opaque black, with a nitro head and huge frothy bubbles that are retained on a solid crown. The smell is super oaty, sweet, mollasses, cream, and dark rich malt, not much toast. The taste betrays the smell with licorice and rich oats up front, shifting into sarsparilla and rich toasted malt, finishing on a lingering hop notes and mollasses sweetness. Finish wise this is a dry stout for me, and the mouthfeel is thin for a typical stout and finishes moderately dry, which i find interesting.

This is a great oatmeal stout that stands out different from others that rely on heavy cloying sweetness so often. Great job!"
5781,ChrisCage,Shakespeare Oatmeal Stout,3.1,"A- This one pours a very dark brown color and is fairly hard to see through, but some light does pass. The head is rich and creamy, about two fingers in thickness initially and settles fast into a thick layer of foam above the brew itself. Carbonation appears to be about average for the style, while the lacing is tan colored, with very little in terms of cling around the inside of the glass. Decent looking overall

S- Lots of cocoa initially, which gives way to a slightly soapy tang. Underlying notes of black coffee, grassy/grainy oat flake, dark fruit remnants, dark chocolate nougat malt sweetness, and dare I say a piney quality that reminds me of the outdoors....interesting!

T- There is some citrus peel zest, piney resin and overall this isn't good for the style. Unfortunately, it overtakes the chocolate/coffee/char that I was hoping for. As for the more traditional flavors, they are there, but are all over the place, and are more noted on the finish than rather in the middle of the taste. There is a weird lingering aftertaste that is more of hops than anything. The oat dryness is present and I think this is enhancing what I am not liking about the flavors here, which is unfortunate, as I normally like a good Oatmeal Stout.

M/O- Medium bodied and the carbonation is fairly robust too, providing more of a pale ale vibe than anything. Drinkability is poor for this reason and overall this falls short in what I was expecting this to be. Rogue is generally a favored brewery with its offerings in my opinion, but this is about as interesting and enjoyable as a Shakespearean play. Not good."
5782,Mindcrime1000,Shakespeare Oatmeal Stout,4.25,"Poured from a bottle into a stout glass.

Pours a very dark-brown (nearly black) opaque with a creamy dark tan head that lingers for the last finger, giving way to exceptional foam and lacing.

Aromas of bittersweet chocolate, dark coffee roasted malts, and dark fruits. 

The brew hits the tip of the tongue with bittersweet chocolate and hints of coffee and roasted grain. And then---the main event arrives in midstream. BIg oat flavor rises above the din, with the grainy oats blending with some subtle but solid dark fruit flavor. Deceptively hidden grassy and earthy hops augment the coffee and chocolate bitterness and bring it all home.

The brew is just shy of full-bodied, with the grainy oats providing a drying finish. Very drinkable for the style.

Exceptional representation of the style."
5783,etan420,Red Stripe Jamaican Lager,2.75,sawdust?
5784,ChrisMoo,Red Stripe Jamaican Lager,4.16,Not a bad beer. Very good on a hot day. Sweet butterscotch flavor. Enjoyed it
5785,Grax,Red Stripe Jamaican Lager,3.4,"Pretty typical beer aroma of sweet corn and malts, heavy undertones of that butterscotch described. The body's pretty much all the same, a bright, refreshing wave of sweet corn, butterscotch, and melon. It's simple and straightforward and a pretty good macro."
5786,secondtooth,Red Stripe Jamaican Lager,3.27,"APPEARANCE: Clean, pale, watery golden, with a light head of white suds.

AROMA: Cereal grains/malts, really pretty average to style.

TASTE: Light and malty/ cereal grainy, not overly sweet but hops are subtle. Pretty decent lager, not too unique but more than drinkable on a warm, sunny day in the Caribbean."
5787,AutoMechanic,Red Stripe Jamaican Lager,4.23,I thought it was a good beer. Has the regular beer smell. Maybe a little bit of hoppy smell. Taste great to me. I drank straight from the bottle so unsure of head or look. For taste though I give it a high score. I had heard mixed things about it but like it well.
5788,walser,Rare Vos Amber Ale,3.93,"19 oz can from Wegmans. Not initially impressed but having let it sit in the glass and taking with dinner, liver and onions, totally different taste profile. Very good. With food or after it resting all the nose and mouth feel come out. Floral, spice, citrus but evened with hops and malt. Very very good with liver and onions. I am impressed how good this pairs with food."
5789,Shiredave,Rare Vos Amber Ale,4.15,"This beer is under rated and appreciated.
Medium-dark amber color with a pale cream head that shows good legs.
Aroma is malt and subtle hop spice of leather and lavender. 
Flavor is a balanced blend of bready malt flavors with warm figs and braised spruce tips.
Medium bodied, perfect food beer with red meat, game or fowl."
5790,BitteNochEinWeissbier,Rare Vos Amber Ale,4.05,"On Draft
Glass: Belgian Tulip Snifter
ABV: 6.5%

Look: 
Hazy and somewhat opaque dark copper. Minimal off white head, likely due to a very full pour.

Aroma: 
Nice estery yeastiness. Vague ripe banana and some other fruits. Some citrus. Sweet but not cloying malts. Some coriander, cloves, and other spices.

Taste: 
Similar to the nose with the malts more prominent and front and center. Orange peel can be detected. The sip dries out as it moves along and finishes dry and a bit spicy.

Feel: 
Mostly smooth but a touch prickly. Also a tad dry. The body is pretty much medium.

Overall: 
A very good amber Belgian Ale. Tasty and enjoyable."
5791,TurboMon_911,Rare Vos Amber Ale,4.14,"12 oz. bottle, (Best by 05/11/23); Poured a cloudy dull copper color into a Samuel Smith Imperial pint glass with a frothy white head that dissipated quickly leaving minimal to no lacing with loads of carbonation present throughout. Aroma is malty with hints of orange peel, coriander and spice from the Belgian yeast, (not overly sweet as it has an earthiness to it that's unique). Flavor has definite Belgian character but is not overstated with the mouth being a little thin. Body is light to medium with a slight tingle on the tongue and a semi dry finish. This was from a mixed 6 gift pack from my brother who though I might like it. He was correct, well done Ommegang!"
5792,Davidstan,Rare Vos Amber Ale,4.39,Just now becoming a Belgian fan. This beer cuts down the middle of high ABV and belgian macro beer. I would think this was a import so 3 cheers to Ommegang
5793,Bluerabbitbell,Rare Vos Amber Ale,4.05,"Enjoyed at home, 12/1/22, from a Kroger pick 6.

Beautiful foamy head and gorgeous copper color. Bitey in the mouth, we definitely get coriander, pepper, caramel and fruity apple and orange maltiness with little sweetness. A bit thin in the mouth, but overall a really curious and delicious offering!"
5794,BubbleBobble,Rare Vos Amber Ale,4.02,"Pours a dark, ruby amber, big 2"" tan head that settles out with little lacing. Lacks the same big, cloud-like head formation of, say, Orval. Nose is dark fruit, roasted pears, brown sugar, red apple, cloves. Taste is extremely clear with more dark fruit, brown sugar, fresh baked brown bread, a earthy spice. Mouthfeel is crisp and clean as well. Extremely clean and unmuddled."
5795,JZH1000,Rare Vos Amber Ale,4.01,"Had on tap at Murphys Tap House in Louisville CO 

On arrival a nice fine 1 finger off white head with good retention is present. Body is a moderately hazy solid amber. It's hard to see much carbonation. No lacing is left.

Aroma is traditionally belgian. A distinct esterty yeastiness is present before a light malt sweetness from amber malts. Not the most hoppy beer, but overall this is a dry belgian slightly darker aroma.

Taste is quite similar to the aroma but the yeast esters are even more present. There is a light hop bitterness, but the yeast largely overwhelms that on the palate. There is a light roasted malty note on the very back but again this is a very dry beer. Very belgian, but also amber, quite nice.

Feel is just as big as any belgian strong with a nice effervescence as well. Despite the color the beer is quite refreshing and is a nice substitute for vienna lager, as long as you enjoy belgian beers. Very dry on the palate as well with only a medium finish.

Overall, despite never seeing a belgian lower abv amber, this would have me fooled. If I didn't know this was from New York I'd believe it us an authentic belgian amber beer, and it's damn tasty too."
